1,General Politics,2024,11,Ex-CNN boss rips media 'hyperbole' on Trump: Their 'end of democracy' claims will lead to 'credibility' crisis,Joseph A. Wulfsohn,"'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the media's outrage over Vice President Harris' election loss. Former CNN boss Chris Licht took a swipe at the ""hyperbole"" from the legacy media leading up to last week's historic victory of President-elect Donald Trump.  Speaking at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference Tuesday, Licht was asked how the media can regain trust as the country embraces a second Trump administration.  His advice to his media colleagues: ""Swing at the pitches that are thrown."" ""To completely butcher a Chris Rock phrase, if someone kills eight people, don't say they killed nine,"" Licht said. ""[Trump's] going to do enough things that really require scrutiny and sounding the alarm bells. Don't say, 'Well, this means this, and that means that's going to happen.' Say he did this, and then let's discuss what that means. Not, ‘Well this is going to mean this’ because a lot of times the media gets in trouble when they predict things.""  CNN STAFFERS ‘DEEPLY FRUSTRATED’ AS LOOMING BUDGET CUTS, LAYOFFS SET TO IMPACT STRUGGLING NETWORK Ex-CNN chairman Chris Licht slammed the ""hyperbole"" coming from the legacy media about a second Trump presidency. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images) Licht, who was ousted as CNN's chairman and CEO in June 2023 after barely over a year on the job, pointed to the ""hyperbole"" he had seen as a media observer regarding what a second Trump presidency would bring. ""'It's the end of democracy.' Well, if it's not, if four years from now it's not, then we have a problem with credibility,"" Licht said. ""So instead, 'He's appointed this person, this is this person's track record,' not 'that means he's going to do this,' right?"" CHRIS WALLACE OUT AT CNN AFTER 3 YEARS AT THE NETWORK ""There will be enough to discuss. There will be enough things that are going to be controversial. But he and his people know exactly what they're doing when they try to gin up what one of my former colleagues called outrage porn. If everything is an 11, and everything is outrageous, then you're able to kind of slip through some things that actually should create that outrage,"" he added.  Licht said the media will have a ""credibility"" problem if democracy is still around after President-elect Trump's second term.  (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Licht was handpicked by Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav in 2022 to help revive CNN's viewership and restore its journalistic credibility after the network spent years building a reputation for being an anti-Trump news organization under predecessor Jeff Zucker.  CNN's rank-and-file resisted Licht's efforts to remove the spectacle from its coverage. Among his major moves were dismissing prominent liberal on-air figures, including Brian Stelter, Don Lemon and Jeffrey Toobin. However, Licht had completely lost the trust of CNN staff after the network hosted the now-infamous Trump town hall in May 2023, which sparked unprecedented fury from within the newsroom. Licht was fired by Zaslav weeks later.  MEDIA RECKONING: WHERE ARE THE PRO-TRUMP DISSENTING VOICES AT LIBERAL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS? Fast-forward to November 2024 as financial woes and dismal viewership continue to plague the network. Many of Licht's decisions were reversed – Stelter was rehired as a media analyst, and Toobin and Lemon have made multiple appearances as guests – and CNN's anti-Trump coverage came back in a roaring fashion through Election Day.  CNN has been plagued with dwindling viewership in recent years.

3,General Politics,2024,11,Republicans to huddle behind closed doors to elect McConnell's successor Wednesday,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the Republican Senate leadership battle. The incoming Senate Republican Conference will meet to hold secret ballot elections for several leadership positions on Wednesday morning, including the successor of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will lead the Republican majority next year. At 9:30 a.m., the conference for the 119th Congress will select a new leader, Republican whip, conference chair, Republican policy committee chair, vice conference chair and National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRS) chair. Those vying for the coveted leader role are Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla.  Senators John Cornyn, John Thune and Rick Scott are being speculated as contenders in the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as leader. (Getty Images) On Tuesday, 42 GOP senators gathered for a leader candidate forum led by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Several of the lawmakers expressed satisfaction with how the discussion went, and Scott ended the evening by adding two additional endorsements.  According to Lee, the Republicans discussed a range of issues, some procedural, some substantive, and some policy-oriented.  President-elect Donald Trump notably has not made an endorsement in the Senate leader race. Scott's race, however, has gained the support of high-profile Trump allies like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and X owner Elon Musk.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., is running unopposed for NRSC chair. Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., will face off for the No. 3 GOP role of conference chair. The Wednesday morning elections will take place in the old Senate chamber in the Capitol. Before each race, each candidate will have two nominating speeches from other senators. Then they'll make their own case. There may be some discussion before senators vote, and the secret ballot will remain private unless individual senators decide to disclose who they chose. Even then, there is no way to verify.

7,General Politics,2024,11,A major swing in these voter groups helped carry Trump to victory,Fox News,"Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams joins contributors Karl Rove and Jason Chaffetz discuss Kamala Harris' struggles in Pennsylvania on 'The Story.' This election cycle, the political landscape in the United States has witnessed significant transformations, particularly among Hispanic and Native American communities. Traditionally associated with the Democratic Party, these groups have shown signs of shifting their allegiances toward the Republican Party. Tuesday, November 5th, will go down in history as one of the world’s greatest political comebacks. After years of politicized investigations and the entire bureaucratic state coming after him, Donald Trump secured an electoral landslide and won back the White House. By focusing on the kitchen table issues that matter to all Americans, regardless of their identity – inflation, illegal immigration, foreign affairs, public safety – Donald Trump was able to expand not only his electoral map but also his electorate. TRUMP TRAIN CHUGS PAST 2020 MARGINS, PARTICULARLY AMONG HISPANICS, URBAN NORTHEASTERNERS Despite both Republicans and Democrats courting the Hispanic and Native American votes, exit polls from Tuesday night found that President Donald Trump received support from almost 65% of Native American voters and 45% of Hispanic voters. OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA - OCTOBER 14: Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, holds a town hall at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem on October 14, 2024 in Oaks, Pennsylvania. His rival, Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, is speaking in Western Pennsylvania city of Erie.  (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) However, these trends are not just unique to the American Southwest. In North Carolina, the once loyally blue Lumbee shifted 36 points to the right in 2020, giving Donald Trump critical votes necessary to win the state. In 2024, Donald Trump expanded his victory amongst tribal members, receiving 63% of the vote in Lumbee-heavy Robeson County. When studying this trend and understanding the impact it will have on election outcomes in the future, it is important to look at why Native American and Latino voters shifted. On the issues, like many Americans, the traditional cultural values of both Hispanics and Native Americans simply do not align with the woke left. At the core of both Hispanic and Native American cultures lies a deep respect for the family unit, traditional gender roles, respect for elders, tradition, God and the sacredness of life. These long-standing cultural values align better with the Republican Party. Another key issue, particularly for tribes and Hispanic voters in New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada, is illegal immigration. While Democrats wrongly assumed Hispanic voters would align with their open-border immigration policies, Hispanics, just like all Americans, want safer communities, too. Native Americans witnessed the Biden-Harris administration roll out the red carpet and at least $150 billion of funding to non-citizens, while many of our own Native American populations don’t have access to running water or electricity. President Trump’s straightforward immigration policy resonates with all Americans. Trump greets Vance at an election night watch party in Palm Beach, Fla.  (AP/Evan Vucci) The concept of the American Dream is also a powerful motivator for many Hispanic and Native American voters. Native Americans on the reservation have experienced some of the highest rates of poverty, destruction and despair as a result of socialist policies – as well as many Hispanics who’ve left communist countries like Cuba and Venezuela. We have a natural distrust of big government socialist policies advanced by far-left Democrats – as many Americans should. No amount of gaslighting from the Harris-Walz campaign could erase the tangible economic results delivered under Trump’s presidency. Native Americans and Hispanics, like all Americans, have hope and aspirations for a better future, rooted in the belief that anyone, regardless of their background, can succeed through hard work and determination. Trump’s policies emphasized this narrative and delivered opportunity and progress. As a Native American and Hispanic woman from the heart of Indian country, Gallup, New Mexico – which is also in a Hispanic majority state, I have worked to bridge the gap between the Republican Party and Native and Hispanic communities. For the first time in recent memory, Donald Trump’s Republican Party made it their mission to earn the trust and support of these communities, and it paid off. CNN and MSNBC became reliable anti-Trump echo chambers during his first term. (Jovanny Hernandez/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) Though it was not enough to win in a state like New Mexico, Donald Trump’s outreach to our community put him within six points of winning, a five point improvement from 2020. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In the last week of his campaign, President Trump came to our state and spoke directly to our communities. New Mexico was never in play this cycle, but he seized the opportunity to make inroads and pushed the needle closer, improving his performances and appealing to a new group of mobilized voters. Groundwork has been laid, a presence has been felt and a movement has begun. Flipping a reliably blue state takes time and with the Republican National Committee and Trump apparatus committed to improving Hispanic and Native American outreach in rural communities that were once reliably blue, we can begin to build a stronger bridge into these communities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The potential for Hispanic and Native American communities to lean towards the Republican Party becomes increasingly plausible.

8,General Politics,2024,11,"Trump cabinet picks delight Taiwan, send strong signal to China",Eryk Michael Smith,"Fox News host Jesse Watters has the latest on the political announcement on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan - President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees to serve as United Nations ambassador, national security adviser, and most importantly, secretary of state are regarded by many as ""China Hawks.""  Their appointments are being mostly welcomed in Taiwan, even by some who did not support the former and future president. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., likely to be tapped to become Trump’s chief diplomat, made his position clear during the Republican National Convention in mid-July, when he said that he expected a re-elected Trump to, ""continue to do what he did in his first term and that is … continue to support Taiwan."" Rubio, however, has been in lockstep with Trump on insisting Taiwan increase defense spending, a view shared by security experts, but not necessarily the majority of Taiwanese people.  As of yet, no official statement has come from Taiwanese President William Lai, but in 2019, when Lai was vice president to then-President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its gratitude to Sen. Rubio and former Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., for rejecting Chinese President Xi Jinping’s proposal (or demand) that Taiwan accept ""one country, two systems.""  TRUMP'S PICKS SO FAR: HERE'S WHO WILL BE ADVISING THE NEW PRESIDENT Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, center, and his wife Wu Mei-Ju, left, with Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim gesture during his inauguration ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Taipei, Taiwan, on Monday, May 20, 2024. (An Rong Xu/Bloomberg via Getty Images) This same formula was supposed to apply to Hong Kong for 50 years after the handover in 1997 but lasted only until roughly 2020, when China imposed draconian new laws. Today, people in Hong Kong can be jailed for non-violent acts of protest, such as wearing a shirt with the words ""Liberate Hong Kong."" An overwhelming majority in Taiwan reject China’s ""one country, two systems,"" and any other plan that gives authoritarian China control of democratic Taiwan.  Rubio is blunt on China, writing on X, for example, ""Communist China is not, and will never be, a friend to democratic nations."" In May 2022, Rubio introduced the ""Taiwan Peace Through Strength Act,"" a bill that would fast-track U.S.-Taiwan military coordination. Rubio stated in connection to the bill that, ""Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not the first time an authoritarian regime invaded its neighbor and, unfortunately, it won’t be the last. An invasion of Taiwan could happen within this decade. Taiwan needs our support, and my bill will make Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party think twice before launching a foolish invasion. We must do all we can to deter an attack on Taiwan, or we risk losing the Indo-Pacific region to the Chinese Communist Party."" Rubio as a potential secretary of state is a problem for China, as the Florida Republican is blacklisted, or in more diplomatic terms, ""sanctioned."" Rubio was among the 11 U.S. senators China sanctioned in 2020 for their ""wrong U.S. behaviors … who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues.""  CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED Former President Donald Trump, left, greets Sen. Marco Rubio during a campaign rally at the J.S. Dorton Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Nov. 4, 2024. (Photo by Ryan M. Kelly / AFP) How to have ""meaningful dialogues"" with a person banned from China remains to be seen. Any option – including rescinding the sanctions – could make China look weak. However, Wu Xinbo, Fudan University professor and director at the Center for American Studies, told Fox News Digital via email from Shanghai that he has some doubts. ""These China hawks will surely push the envelope on the Taiwan question as hard as they can,"" said Wu, ""but it may backfire, and the U.S. will get burned. I'm not sure if this is what Trump wants."" So far, however, Trump seems to be sending clear signals that his administration will not be all bark and no bite. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., Trump’s choice for national security adviser, is at least as strident as Rubio. Writing in The Economist earlier this month, Waltz, opined that conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East need to be ""urgently"" ended, so the U.S. can ""finally focus strategy attention where it should be: countering the greater the threat from the Chinese Communist Party.""  Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) speaks during Day 1 of the Republican National Convention on July 15, 2024 in Milwaukee. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Trump has also nominated his loyal ally, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY., to be his ambassador to the United Nations. Senior Adviser to the think-tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies Richard Goldberg wrote that, aside from enthusiastically vetoing anti-Israel U.N. resolutions, he expects Stefanik to work toward ""leveraging American financial assistance across the U.N. system to root out Chinese malign influence…"" Rather predictably, netizens on China’s censored internet went with the ""who cares?"" line that has become common. Ross Darrell Feingold, a Taipei-based lawyer and rare American in Taiwan who is active on TouTiao, a Chinese social media platform, told Fox News Digital that the comments he received in response to the likely Rubio nomination included, ""Doesn't matter. All U.S. politicians are anti-China,"" and, ""No such thing as ‘anti-China, pro-Taiwan.’ There's only ‘anti-China’ and the U.S. isn't serious about being pro-Taiwan.""

Former first lady Melania Trump said she questions whether current first lady Jill Biden's ""concern was genuine"" following the first assassination attempt against President-elect Donald Trump in July, due to her rhetoric about her husband in the days leading up to the incident.  Trump, in an interview with French publication ""Paris Match"" last month, said that Biden ""took the initiative to contact me directly"" after ""someone tried to murder my husband in Pennsylvania"" during his rally on July 13. ""I do question, however, whether Jill’s concern was genuine as a few days prior she referred to my husband as ‘evil’ and a ‘liar,’"" Trump said.

Rick Scott, R-Fla., says he is committed to getting the president-elect's agenda passed on 'Hannity.' Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., was knocked out of the Senate leader race after the first secret ballot on Wednesday morning, during which none of the three candidates received a majority of the votes. Senate Minority Whip John Thune was ultimately elected as the new Republican Senate leader and the majority leader of the upper chamber in the new Congress after winning a second secret ballot. Sources told Fox News that Scott received the least number of votes during the first ballot. The senators advanced to a second secret ballot between only Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Thune received the most votes on the first ballot with 23, but fell short of a majority, needing four more. Cornyn posted 15 votes, despite having only one public endorsement beforehand. Scott received 13 votes in the ballot before being knocked out of the race. The new Senate GOP leader was chosen on Wednesday.

16,General Politics,2024,11,"Trump, defying media predictions, mainly picks seasoned Capitol Hill veterans such as Marco Rubio",Howard Kurtz,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports the latest on the growing divide.  The media warned for months that Donald Trump would have ""no guardrails"" in a second term, and would probably hand out top positions to a bunch of right-wing crazies. Instead, he picked Marco Rubio yesterday as secretary of State, a 14-year Senate veteran and son of Cuban immigrants who has been informally advising him on foreign policy. MEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS The president-elect has also tapped a number of Hill veterans who are conventional conservatives, agree with him on key issues and could just as easily have been named by Mitt Romney. Also yesterday, Trump selected Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor, as Homeland Security secretary, after she overcame the dog-shooting incident that knocked her out of the veepstakes. Trump has been rolling out these appointments at hyper-speed, just a week after the election. He has stayed off TV and hasn’t made any inflammatory posts. He’s trying to demonstrate a seriousness about governing, by hitting the ground running. In the past, presidents and presidents-elect have appeared on air, praising their nominee or maybe two, and yielding to a short, grateful speech by the chosen ones. But Trump appears to be skipping all that.  All the top jobs haven’t been filled, obviously, but even some top Democrats are praising the choice of Rubio (while some in the MAGA movement are disappointed). He’s unquestionably a hawk, and will be the face of American foreign policy as he travels around the world.  President-elect Donald Trump is pictured in front of the White House. (Getty Images/AP Images) Sure, he said some terrible things about Trump, who derided him as Little Marco, when both ran in 2016. I watched Rubio on the trail that year and he’s a very charismatic speaker. But the two have long since mended fences. Rubio tried to push immigration reform a decade ago as part of various Senate gangs, but has since distanced himself from the effort. I keep seeing television chyrons that, almost in accusatory fashion, say Trump is hiring ""loyalists."" Excuse me–do you think that Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton didn’t hire loyalists? Presidents want aides who generally agree with them and won’t turn into troublemakers. Biden hired such longtime advisers as Ron Klain, Mike Donilon and Steve Richetti. From a conservative point of view, when Biden hired top officials who wanted to strengthen environmental rules, boost labor unions and spend hundreds of billions of dollars to dig out of the pandemic, that was a hard-line departure from Trump 1.0. Now Trump will reverse many Biden policies with the stroke of a pen. DEPRESSED MEDIA REACT TO TRUMP VICTORY: HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED? The other picks so far: Upstate New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a member of the House leadership and impeachment defender, has been tapped for U.N. ambassador.  Trump also chose former Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. He’s a mainstream conservative who has crusaded against excessive environmental regulations and gotten a lifetime score of 14 percent from the League of Conservation Voters. He told Fox News that the administration will ""roll back regulations"" that are causing businesses to ""struggle"" and are ""forcing"" them to move overseas. After that, Trump tapped Florida GOP congressman Mike Waltz, a former Green Beret, as White House national security adviser, which doesn’t require Senate confirmation. He’s a China hawk and Ukraine skeptic. ""Stopping Russia before it draws NATO and therefore the U.S. into war is the right thing to do,"" Waltz wrote. ""But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass.""  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., attends a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump at the Trump National Doral Golf Club on July 9, 2024 in Doral, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) These are serious people who know how Washington works. By the way, Trump has shrunk what’s expected to be a very small GOP edge in the House by picking two members. But in Rubio’s case, Gov. Ron DeSantis can appoint a replacement who would serve until the midterm elections. As I’m typing this, Trump just named Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate, as ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has led many delegations to the country and is staunchly pro-Israel.  And after I filed this, Trump named Bill McGinley, who worked on election integrity for the RNC and was general counsel for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as his White House counsel. And after I filed the insert, another announcement: John Ratcliffe being tapped for CIA director. The former Texas congressman, known for criticizing the FBI as biased against Trump, became his director of national intelligence in 2020.  Last night, Trump made his first hire from Fox News. Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and co-host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" has been named Defense secretary. Trump noted that Hegseth did tours in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, was awarded two Bronze Stars, and just published the best-selling ""The War on Warriors."" Trump tried to get him confirmed the previous year, but Ratcliffe withdrew after GOP senators and ex-intel officials raised concerns about him, amid media disclosures that he’d embellished his prosecutorial efforts in immigration and terrorism cases. So he certainly qualifies as a highly partisan pick. The two appointees who can fairly be described as aggressive hard-liners–critics would say extremists–are Stephen Miller and Tom Homan–both hired to deal with Trump’s top priority, the border. Miller, who spearheaded immigration policy in the first Trump term, has been promoted to deputy chief of staff, and even that title doesn’t capture the clout he’ll have as a trusted member of the inner circle. He pushed the family separation policy that was extremely controversial. WHY THE MEDIA WAITED TILL NOW TO ADMIT HARRIS RAN A LOUSY CAMPAIGN Homan, who ran ICE in the first term, is being called the border czar. When asked if there was a way to avoid separating families, as happened last time, he said sure–deport them all together. He said at a conference over the summer: ""Washington Post can do all the stories they want on me about ‘Tom Homan’s deportin’ people, he’s really good at it!’ They ain’t seen s*** yet! Wait till 2025!"" Miller and Homan will be responsible for carrying out mass deportations of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants living in America, or at least starting the process so the president-elect can say he kept his promise. Critics call the goal utterly unrealistic. Now there are others who will also enjoy huge influence. Elon Musk, who donated $119 million to help Trump, is now the most powerful private citizen ever–heading a waste commission, posting hundreds of messages on X, sitting in on Trump call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy – all while seeking billions in federal contracts. Trump said last night that Musk will head a Department of Government Efficiency - he promised to ""send shockwaves through the system"" - with help from former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.  Tom Homan, former acting director of US Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. ( Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images) RFK Jr. will get some title, but Trump has to decide whether to go along with his hotly disputed ideas on vaccines and removing fluoride from water systems. He’s also threatened to fire FDA officials who have waged a ""war on public health,"" saying the agency has suppressed such products as raw milk, ivermectin and vitamins. And of course J.D. Vance will be an unusually active vice president and heir apparent.   Still to come: the top jobs of Treasury secretary and the extraordinarily sensitive post of attorney general. I also want to know who’ll be press secretary! One reason we’re in for weeks and weeks of skeptical to negative coverage is that every beat reporter on the planet must now do obligatory pieces on Donald Trump. Whether they cover sports, religion, labor, housing, entertainment, courts, energy, television, schools or crime, they need to write about the impact of the 47th president–keeping in mind that he weighs in on everything.   From yesterday alone:  Washington Post: ""Trump Pledged to Close the Education Department. What would that mean?"" New York Times: ""Trump’s ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ Cuts Two Ways for Oil Companies."" And: ""Colleges Wonder if They Will Be ‘the Enemy’ Under Trump"" But my personal favorite: ""What a Trump Presidency Means for the Liquor Industry."" (Trump doesn’t drink, but every industry wants less regulation.) There’s also this Drudge headline: ""Wife Divorces Husband Over Vote."" As the Mirror reports, ""A man has said he can’t believe his wife was ready to ‘throw away our entire life’ after filing for divorce over his vote for Donald Trump.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The distraught husband wrote on social media that he has been left without words that the marriage could fall apart over politics.""

18,General Politics,2024,11,Media liberals savage Kamala as Trump picks experienced hard-liners,Howard Kurtz,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has updates on control of the U.S. House and the race for GOP Senate leader on 'The Story.' I have now read 587 pieces on why Kamala Harris got clobbered, so I consider myself an expert. I have also watched endless cable segments in which left-leaning pundits either grappled with the fallout from the Democratic wipeout, or urged their colleagues to become part of the Resistance, with Rachel Maddow telling the ""free press"" to ""stand and fight."" As Donald Trump moves quickly to fill top administration posts – and newspaper pieces warn of the horrors to come – the denigration of Harris, and Joe Biden, has reached fever pitch. And yet, many of the media liberals who praised the Kamala operation as ""flawless"" and ""incredible"" now basically say it was a no-good, horrible, very bad campaign. That makes clear they knew this all along, but wouldn’t say so, because they were protecting the vice president as a way of trying to keep Trump out of the White House. This is yet another blow to the media’s plummeting credibility. BIDEN, HARRIS TEAMS IN LEAK WAR AFTER KAMALA HARRIS' 2024 ELECTION LOSS President Biden, from left, Vice President Kamala Harris, Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough and Maj. Gen. Trevor Bredenkamp, commanding general of the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region and the U.S. Military District of Washington, stand during a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on National Veterans Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va., Monday, Nov. 11, 2024.  (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Here are some of the media post-mortems: Andrew Sullivan: ""How could an entire left-liberal worldview be more comprehensibly dismantled by reality? And yet, the primary response among my own liberal friends was rage at the electorate. They texted me to insist that Harris lost because of white people — white women, in particular.""  Maureen Dowd: ""Some Democrats are finally waking up and realizing that woke is broke… ""Kamala, a Democratic lawmaker told me, made the ‘colossal mistake’ of running a billion-dollar campaign with celebrities like Beyoncé when many of the struggling working-class voters she wanted couldn’t even afford a ticket to a Beyoncé concert, much less a down payment on a home."" Nellie Bowles, the Free Press, said Harris ""made me furious, because she’s a good and fine person who ran a truly terrible campaign. It was a campaign that exemplified all of the delusions of the modern Democrats: that you never need to say what you stand for (because people should just assume you know what’s best for them), that you should never answer hard questions or appear with questionable figures, and that the only issue any American woman should care about is abortion… ""The real villain of this story is Zombie Biden and his corrupt family, who the media treated like heroes the whole way through."" David Brooks: ""There will be some on the left who will say Trump won because of the inherent racism, sexism and authoritarianism of the American people. Apparently, those people love losing and want to do it again and again and again… ""Can the party of the universities, the affluent suburbs and the hipster urban cores do this [disrupt the Republicans]? Well, Donald Trump hijacked a corporate party, which hardly seemed like a vehicle for proletarian revolt, and did exactly that. Those of us who condescend to Trump should feel humbled — he did something none of us could do."" Politico: ""How can Harris’s defenders grumble about being dragged down by Biden when she could not find one substantive policy issue on which to break from the unpopular incumbent? She waited three months, blurted out on ‘The View’ that she couldn’t think of any difference with Biden.""  National Review: ""She was a lousy candidate with an even lousier message, if you can call it that. The only thing she had to do was sell herself, and she couldn’t manage even this fundamental task."" COLUMNIST CALLS OUT KAMALA HARRIS FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO ANSWER CRITICAL QUESTION ON ‘THE VIEW’ Well, you get the idea. In a 107-day campaign, Harris couldn’t convince enough Americans that she was authentic, that she could be commander-in-chief, or that she had abandoned the far-left policies (such as legalizing border crossings and backing inmate trans surgeries) of her last campaign. She foolishly hid from the press for a month, fostering the impression that she couldn’t go off script. Now just about everyone – except those blaming her loss on racism and sexism – is saying what I’ve been saying for three months. Harris never should have picked Tim Walz, who did nothing for the ticket. The trans issue hurt her and she never picked an issue, that or something else, to separate from the left wing of her party. She worried too much about hurting Joe’s feelings. The VP tried to focus on kitchen-table economics, such as with her price-gouging plan. But despite low inflation and unemployment right now, many Americans still felt they were paying higher grocery prices and liked Trump’s economic record better than Biden’s. Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is comforted by second gentleman Doug Emhoff, as Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks, conceding 2024 U.S. presidential election to President-elect Donald Trump, at Howard University in Washington on November 6, 2024.  (REUTERS/Mike Blake) It may well be there’s nothing Harris could have done to stop the Trump juggernaut, given his hijacking of working class and minority voters. Now the president-elect is moving quickly to tap his top appointees, having immediately named campaign manager Susie Wiles as his chief of staff – the first woman ever to hold the job. Tom Homan, who was ICE director in Trump’s first term, will be the border czar, not a big surprise. Homan will be in charge of the mass deportation program, and when asked if there was a way to avoid separating families, as happened last time, he said sure – deport them all together. Stephen Miller, who ran the hard-line immigration policy in the first term, is expected to be named deputy chief of staff – a promotion, first reported yesterday by CNN, that probably doesn’t convey the clout he’ll have as a trusted member of Trump’s inner circle. TRUMP WILL LEAVE THE WH WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATINGS OF ANY MODERN PRESIDENT, LARA TRUMP PREDICTS I had been told days ago that Elise Stefanik, a GOP congresswoman from upstate New York, would go into the administration. And yesterday, Trump tapped her to be U.N. ambassador. She has experience in the George W. Bush White House. Then there are insiders who are the subject of speculation. Howard  Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO, is being touted by some as a possible Treasury secretary, but has his hands full as a co-chair of the transition.

Late yesterday, Trump chose former Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. He’s a mainstream conservative who has crusaded against excessive environmental regulations and gotten a lifetime score of 14% from the League of Conservation Voters. The choice of Zeldin was first reported by the New York Post, and he told Fox News that the administration will ""roll back regulations"" that are causing businesses to ""struggle"" and are ""forcing"" them to move overseas. After that, he tapped Florida GOP congressman Mike Waltz as White House national security adviser, which doesn’t require Senate confirmation. As the Wall Street Journal first reported, he’s a China hawk and Ukraine skeptic. ""Stopping Russia before it draws NATO and therefore the U.S. into war is the right thing to do,"" Waltz wrote. ""But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass."" (Trump has now reduced by two the House Republicans’ expected small margin.) Oh, and Politico says some Dems are already jockeying for 2028 (Josh Shapiro and Gavin Newsom) or being talked about (Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear). Already? Can’t we get a break?  So my takeaway is that for all the media chatter about a lack of guardrails, Trump is so far picking serious people with serious experience. (Wiles hasn’t worked in Washington since the Reagan years, but her role is different.) They are, of course, also loyalists who will do his bidding.  Then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Mint Hill, N.C. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) RFK Jr. will get a big title, but it’s not clear whether Trump will follow his far-out advice on vaccines and fluoride. And Elon Musk will be in charge of just about everything, and the world’s richest man has deluged X with hundreds of pro-Trump posts (and some high-profile liberals are bailing). But the most striking moment was Trump’s post saying Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo would not be joining the administration – not that anyone was expecting they would be. In his posting, the president-elect said he enjoyed working with both of them and thanked them for their service. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP My reaction was: Did somebody steal Trump’s phone? The words idiot and moron did not appear. Maybe this is a new tone from an incoming president who finally feels vindicated. We’ll see how long it lasts.

OpenAI has assembled a ""blueprint"" for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure that the company hopes will be considered by the incoming Trump administration and Congress – suggesting that the plan will help the United States maintain its lead in the field over competitors like China. The company’s Vice President of Global Affairs, Chris Lehane, announced the ""Infrastructure Blueprint for the U.S."" on Wednesday during an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).  The company says AI's potential presents an ""unmissable opportunity to revitalize the American Dream and reindustrialize the US."" ""Investments to extend the current U.S. lead in AI will yield tens of thousands of skilled-trade and other jobs, growth in productivity and GDP; a modernized grid including power generated by nuclear energy; a state-of-the-art network of semiconductor manufacturing facilities; and a new generation of AI-powered businesses and entrepreneurship,"" OpenAI claims. PETITION CALLS FOR TRUMP ADMIN TO APPOINT MUSK AS AI ADVISER In this photo illustration, the OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen with ChatGPT logo in the background. (Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The company, led by Sam Altman, also estimates that U.S.-backed projects abroad will help attract $175 billion currently sitting in global funds. They purport that these potential investments are a beneficial alternative to China-backed projects—characterizing the East Asian country's endeavors as a means to limit citizen access to AI, tighten government control over the populace and strengthen global influence. ""We need a national strategy now to ensure that investment in AI infrastructure benefits and protects American competitiveness, our national security and that of our allies,"" the company said in its blueprint release. ""This strategy should encourage rather than stifle developers, who will be the Main Street businesses of the Intelligence Age. It should support thriving AI ecosystems of labs, start-ups and larger companies that together will secure America's leadership role on AI into the future.""  OpenAI listed a set of five initiatives to catalyze the building of AI infrastructure in the U.S. and with allies across the world. 1) AI economic zones: The company is urging state and federal governments to give states incentives that speed up the permitting and approval of AI infrastructure –thereby making it easier to complete new solar arrays, wind farms and bring nuclear reactors back online. OpenAI said states providing subsidies could include a clause that ensures a portion of the compute is made available to public universities.

(Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) 2) National Transmission Highway Act: OpenAI is pushing for a program that would give funding to stand-up transmission infrastructure for AI, including electrical power on an AI-optimized transmission grid, high-bandwidth data communications, and pipelines for other energy sources needed to power a nationwide ""AI highway."" 3) Government backstops for high-value AI public works: Open AI believes the U.S. government can encourage the private sector to fund high-cost energy infrastructure projects. The government would then commit to purchasing energy and other means that lower credit risk. Furthermore, the government could direct funding to local training programs that prepare Americans for AI jobs, such as data center management and operations. OpenAI says existing state-sponsored 529 educational savings accounts 
could also be altered to allow investments in coding boot camps, HVAC technician training and electrical training. 4) A North American Compact for AI: The company suggests a pact among countries in the Western Hemisphere to streamline access to capital, supply chains and talent. They believe that eventually, as it expands, the sharing of resources and information could easily compete with the People's Republic of China's AI infrastructure alliances. AI-POWERED ATTACK DRONES TAKE FLIGHT 5) Tapping the expertise of the US nuclear Navy: OpenAI is pushing the government to utilize the Navy, which operates approximately 100 Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to power naval submarines. In their blueprint, the Navy could offer their expertise to construct civilian SMR's and ""catalyze a revival of the American nuclear power that helps drive our great reindustrialization."" ""AI presents an unmissable opportunity to reindustrialize the U.S. and, through that, generate the kind of broad-based economic growth that will revitalize the American Dream. It also presents a national security imperative to protect our nation and our allies against a surging China by offering an AI shaped by democratic values, promoting individual choice and benefiting the most people possible,"" OpenAI said. OpenAI believes the incoming Trump administration should consider their ideas for the future of AI infrastructure.  (Getty Images) Leaders in both the House and Senate have emphasized that getting lawmakers up to speed on AI is a priority for Congress. However, they've diverged somewhat on what that means. Still, people close to the growing AI sector say they are frustrated with the pace Congress is handling the technology. In July, Congress passed a bipartisan act to mitigate financial and regulatory challenges impeding nuclear energy development. According to Pew, a majority of Americans favor an increase in nuclear plants to generate electricity. TRUMP'S FIRST CABINET PICKS DECIDEDLY NOT ISOLATIONISTS: UKRAINE, ISRAEL BREATHE A SIGN OF RELIEF Still, the shutdown of nuclear reactors continues to outpace new construction. President-elect Donald Trump took a skeptical stance on nuclear energy in his interview with podcaster Joe Rogan leading up to the election. ""There’s a little danger to nuclear,"" he said.

23,General Politics,2024,11,Trump thanks Biden for 'smooth transition' during White House meeting,Brooke Singman,"President-elect Donald Trump met with President Biden in the Oval Office on Wednesday, vowing a 'smooth transition' of power between the administrations. WASHINGTON - President-elect Trump and President Biden both pledged a smooth transition between administrations, as they met at the White House on Wednesday morning.  ""I look forward…to having a smooth transition. We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need,"" President Biden said as cameras and reporters were briefly allowed in the Oval Office for the meeting. Speaking second, Trump emphasized that ""politics is tough and in many cases it’s not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today. ""I appreciate very much the transition that's so smooth. It will be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that, the former and future president added. LOYALTY MATTERS: TRUMP PICKS ALLIES AND SUPPORTERS TO FILL OUT HIS SECOND ADMINISTRATION President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue just over a week after his sweeping election victory, as he made his first stop back at the White House in nearly four years. He arrived at the White House at the invitation of Biden, the politician he knocked out of the 2024 presidential race. For Biden - who ended his own re-election bid in July, a month after his disastrous debate performance against Trump reignited questions over whether the 81-year-old president was physically and mentally up for another four years in the White House and sparked calls for him to drop out of the race - the meeting with his predecessor and now successor was likely awkward. HERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 Trump spent years verbally eviscerating Biden and his performance in the White House. And even after Biden ended his re-election bid, Trump continued to slam the president and his successor atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket - Vice President Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) And Biden, for a couple of years, has labeled Trump a threat to the nation's democracy. But Biden, a traditionalist, wants to ensure a smooth transition between administrations. Biden's offer to Trump to visit the White House was an invitation he himself was never accorded. Four years ago, in the wake of his election defeat at the hands of Biden, Trump refused to concede and tried unsuccessfully to overturn the results. VANCE IS THE FRONT-RUNNER, BUT HERE'S WHO ELSE MAY RUN FOR THE 2028 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION Breaking with longstanding tradition, Trump didn't invite Biden to the White House. And two weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters aiming to upend congressional certification of Biden's Electoral College victory, Trump left Washington ahead of the presidential inauguration of his successor, becoming the first sitting president in a century and a half to skip out on a successor's inauguration. According to sources, incoming White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and current White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients were in attendance on Wednesday as Trump and Biden met behind closed doors. ""President Biden's decision to welcome President-elect Trump to the White House is a tribute to normalcy in the presidential transition process. What was denied to Joe Biden following his election, is being restored to Biden's credit,"" veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance told Fox News. President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP) Lesperance, the president of New Hampshire-based New England College, called the invitation by Biden "" a remarkable gesture in that it legitimizes Trump's return to power by the nation's leading Democrat and, hopefully, will be met with a commitment to orderly transitions in the future."" The meeting will be the first between Biden and Trump since they faced off on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia, in their one and only debate. The two presidents - along with Harris and Trump's running mate and now vice president-elect, Sen. JD Vance - stood next to each other on Sept. 11 in New York City's Lower Manhattan, at ceremonies for the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This was Trump's second meeting at the White House with a departing president. Eight years ago, after defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump sat down at the White House with President Barack Obama, who was finishing up his second term steering the nation. ""We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,"" Obama told Trump at the time. While a tradition, the meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents is not mandated.

24,Congress,2024,11,John Thune snags 2 more endorsements in competitive GOP leader race to succeed McConnell,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on when the Senate plans to vote for the GOP majority leader on ’Your World.’ FIRST ON FOX: Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., gained two endorsements in the Senate Republican leader race, as both North Dakota Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven threw their support behind him. Cramer will be voting for Thune in the first secret ballot on Wednesday morning. ""I told both Rick Scott and John Cornyn today that I'll be casting my first vote for John Thune,"" the North Dakota senator said in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.  Thune is competing against Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla., to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as Republican leader in the upper chamber. McConnell is the longest-serving party leader in Senate history.  ""Thune has never lied to me,"" Cramer said of the leader candidate. ""I can't say that of everybody.""  Despite this comment, he maintained he has no ""enemies"" within the conference, which he said is a ""good group."" TRUMP ALLIES BACK RICK SCOTT IN GOP SENATE LEADER RACE AS THEY LOOK TO INFLUENCE SECRET BALLOT Kevin Cramer is the latest Republican to publicly endorse Thune. (Reuters) He said making an endorsement was ""the way to do it,"" in his opinion. ""There's 53 of us. We all sought these positions of influence and, you know, appearing neutral seems sort of cowardice, if you will."" As his reasoning for supporting Thune, the senator explained their long history, both coming from a Dakota. ""I've known John Thune since we were children, basically,"" he said, referencing the 1990 election cycle in both North and South Dakota when they were Republican Party directors.

(Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""All four of us from the Dakotas, of course, are supporting him,"" he added. Thune and Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., are publicly backing the former, but Hoeven hadn't previously made a public endorsement.  Hoeven's office confirmed on Monday to Fox News Digital that he is backing Thune. ""I mean, John and I have a long personal relationship. He's a good friend. He is from the neighborhood,"" Cramer said.  According to the North Dakota Republican, he thinks the leader race will need to go to a second secret ballot, as one candidate must reach 27 votes in order to win.  SENATE LEADER CONTENDER JOHN THUNE RESPONDS TO NEW TRUMP LITMUS TEST AHEAD OF ELECTION Senators John Thune, John Cornyn, and Rick Scott are contenders in the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as leader. (Getty Images) As for the high-profile endorsements of Scott coming from external figures frequently aligned with President-Elect Donald Trump, Cramer said, ""Everybody has an opinion. I mean, I have people in my own party in North Dakota that would like me to do one thing or another."" But, he stressed that the Republican conference as a whole is in line with Trump. ""I endorsed Donald Trump and Donald Trump endorsed me,"" the senator said.  ""[W]hen it comes to the—literally the issue of governing, we're all on the same team. The Republican majority in the Senate to a T is in sync with Donald Trump's agenda.""

25,Congress,2024,8,Speaker Mike Johnson: Only Americans should decide our elections. Here’s how Congress can guarantee it,Rep. Mike Johnson,"Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Darrell Issa took an impromptu trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday. This clip was shared by Johnson's official X account after his trip. Credit: Speaker Mike Johnson via X. There are few things more important to our country than ensuring the integrity of our elections. The people rightfully demand it, and Congress has a duty to act.   Yet, when given the opportunity to eliminate one of the most glaring threats to fair elections, 198 House Democrats voted instead to keep the door open to fraud.  The threat is very real. In nearly all 50 states today — including every major electoral battleground state — a noncitizen can walk into a DMV or welfare office, fill out a federal voter registration form, claim they are a U.S. citizen, and be registered to vote.  That noncitizen can then cast a ballot and help decide the direction of America.  REPUBLICANS SAY SCHUMER MUST ACT ON VOTER PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP BILL IF DEMOCRAT 'REALLY CARES ABOUT DEMOCRACY' This is not a hypothetical problem. I was recently in San Diego, CA to tour the new epicenter of the Biden-Harris border catastrophe where brave, overworked Customs and Border Protection agents have encountered millions of illegals. The agents told me the Biden-Harris Executive Order isn’t working the way the administration says it is. In some ways, it’s made the crisis worse.   Noncitizen voting jeopardizes the rights of all Americans. FILE: 'Vote Here' sign is seen at a voting precinct.  (REUTERS/Emily Elconin) Instead of carrying out their mission of protecting our borders, they have become processing agents, forced by the administration to send illegals throughout the country with little paperwork or record of their location. Many of them end up at local DMVs.   While it is illegal and clearly wrong for a noncitizen to vote in a federal election, and thus engage in foreign election interference, a current loophole in the National Voter Registration Act actually prevents states from requesting proof of citizenship when the registration form is signed.    To close that dangerous loophole and help ensure that only Americans decide American elections, House Republicans drafted and passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.   Our legislation makes several critically important reforms. It requires state election officials to request proof of citizenship for every person registering to vote and gives the state officials easy access to federal databases so they can confirm citizenship status.  The SAVE Act also requires those state officials to clean up their voter rolls and directs the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to determine whether to conduct removal proceedings of any illegal alien who has registered unlawfully.  To ensure actual citizens can continue to easily register to vote, the bill allows state officials to accept a wide variety of documents for registrants to prove citizenship and requires states to establish an alternative process for Americans who have misplaced their documentation.   Finally, the SAVE Act requires DHS to notify a state chief election official whenever an individual has been naturalized to ensure our newest citizens can exercise their right to vote.  These commonsense provisions are not only right, but they are also in high demand. Polling has shown that 89% of Americans believe only Americans should decide elections — including 82% of Democrats, 80% of Black voters, and 78% of Hispanic voters.  In light of all this, one would expect overwhelmingly bipartisan support for the SAVE Act in Congress. But Democrat leaders put on a full-court press to discourage their members from supporting our bill, and the White House issued a veto threat.  The Democrats’ opposition to this simple election integrity bill is indefensible and exposes their intention to allow illegal aliens to vote.   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Earlier this year, most of these same Democrats voted to count illegal aliens in the 2030 Census. They also voted to let noncitizens vote in local elections in Washington, D.C. Some may also remember, how, in 2019, then-presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris relied on a study that touted the ""electoral implications"" of widespread amnesty, including ""sizable contributions to the margin of victory in swing states."" Perhaps that’s why Border Czar Harris has done such a pitiful job securing the border.  Those who have illegally entered our country have no regard for our laws and have no right to interfere in our lawful election processes. Virtually all Americans agree — except for the Biden-Harris administration and congressional Democrats, who are so desperate to hang on to power that they will sacrifice the integrity of our election system.    While it is illegal and clearly wrong for a noncitizen to vote in a federal election, and thus engage in foreign election interference, a current loophole in the National Voter Registration Act actually prevents states from requesting proof of citizenship when the registration form is signed.    In a study of the 2008 election, researchers estimated that 6.4% of noncitizens in the U.S. had voted in the general election. If a similar portion of the 7.2 million illegal aliens Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have welcomed into the country were to vote this year, those 460,800 votes would be more than enough to change the election outcome in a few key battleground states.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In an era of divided government where every single ballot matters immensely, we must have zero tolerance for fraud. One of our Republican colleagues won her first race in 2020 by only six votes. And for many weeks during this Congress, our majority in the House was held by just a one vote margin.   As the sanctity of our elections now hangs in the balance, the SAVE Act is urgently needed. It is smart policy and overwhelmingly supported by the American people. Everyone who shares this common concern should insist that Senator Schumer bring this bill forward to pass in the Senate, and that President Biden then sign it into law. The stakes could not be any higher.  Republican Mike Johnson is the 56th speaker of the United States House of Representatives and represents Louisiana's 4th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

26,Congress,2024,10,Hard-line GOP effort to decentralize Senate leader authority dashed by McConnell ally,Julia Johnson,"Fox News' Brooke Taylor reports on the tight Senate race in Texas between Sen. Ted Cruz and Democrat opponent Colin Allred on ‘Special Report.’ As Senate Republicans approach their first competitive leader election in decades to pick a replacement for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., forces in the conference are pushing dueling pathways for the party as hard-liners hope to decentralize the leader's authority in backing ""Democrat priorities."" ""To avoid the gridlock of business as usual, it is imperative that we structure the Senate in a way that gives individual senators real legislative power, not just lip service,"" wrote Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in an op-ed for Fox News this week.  Lee, who is chair of the Senate Republican Steering Committee, said that if former President Trump gets elected next month, there is limited time to pass his agenda with an expected slim majority in the Senate and potentially in the House as well.  MIKE LEE: THE UNNOTICED ELECTION THAT COULD DETERMINE THE FUTURE Senators are divided over how to proceed and whether to reform the GOP conference before the leader election; from left are Sen. Mike Lee, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Thom Tillis. (Reuters) Running to succeed McConnell are Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla. For Scott, democratizing the conference has been the guiding principle of his leadership campaign.  Both Thune and Cornyn have expressed openness to changes, and in fact, Cornyn threw his support behind a push for term limits for the Republican leader.  ""Moderates will be tempted to join Democrats to pass funding bills that tie Trump’s hands,"" Lee warned of Congress under a potential second Trump presidency.  The Utah Republican is among a cohort of senators that has pushed to democratize the Senate GOP conference and decentralize power from the leader, in particular.  Lee outlined specific requests of a potential Republican leader, which included nixing restrictions on individual senators' ability to offer amendments, allowing significantly longer periods to debate legislation, and requiring broad conference support to ""whip"" in favor of bills or nominees.  'DESPICABLE HUMAN BEING': MCCONNELL'S 2020 THOUGHTS ON 'SLEAZEBALL' TRUMP REVEALED IN NEW BOOK Lee has been vocal about wanting change in the conference. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""This would protect Republican leadership from ever being in the position of having to whip for legislation advancing Democrat priorities,"" he recently wrote in a conference-wide letter.  While some members of the conference, frustrated with its direction under McConnell, have similarly advocated for such a plan, others have pushed back.  An ally of the minority leader, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., sent his own letter to the conference just after Lee, writing, ""It may be true that many Americans would be shocked to know that members may not be able to offer amendments."" But, he said, ""I suspect many Americans would also be shocked to know that any one member can grind the legislative process to a halt while attempting to advance an amendment that a supermajority of our conference is against.""  On several occasions, members such as Lee and those in agreement with him have disrupted the amendment process advanced by the conference, able to do so by denying unanimous consent. The Senate is often referred to as running on the unanimous consent of members because the upper chamber can very easily be upended by one senator unwilling to allow processes to move forward.  A similar criticism of these senators was offered by a former Republican leadership aide, who said, ""Often it is the same cohort of individuals who are decrying the centralization of power that do everything – not with the intention of yielding that result – but all of their behaviors drive the decision-making into the leader's office at the 11th and a half hour."" HARRIS BARNSTORMS WISCONSIN IN 1-DAY SWING STATE TOUR TARGETING YOUNG VOTERS Tillis is an ally of McConnell. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) According to the former aide, the ultimate increase in power of leaders is the result of years and years of ""institutional pressures.""  ""This was a long slide into the marginalization of rank-and-file senators in favor of leadership."" In fact, they said, no matter who is elected as the next leader, they cannot decentralize power and democratize the GOP conference on their own.  Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, former top spokesperson to former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and former chief of staff of the Senate Republican Conference, said that ""Senator Tillis is acting as a proxy for McConnell"" who isn't publicly discussing changes to the conference but is passionately arguing against certain reforms in closed-door meetings.  According to a Republican source familiar, ""Tillis is running McConnell's ground game"" when it comes to preserving the conference's norms and guardrails.  In his initial letter, Lee told colleagues the leader election is ""a once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to ""lower the temperature of our politics and restore public trust in our institutions."" Tillis specifically opposed negotiating reforms as part of the race, writing, ""I believe we need to elect a new leader first, rather than negotiate terms with the Republican leader candidates before the vote."" STRIKING BOEING WORKERS BOO AFTER DEMOCRATIC SEN MARIA CANTWELL CRITICIZES TRUMP From left: Sens. John Cornyn, John Thune and Rick Scott are contenders in the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as leader. (Getty Images) The North Carolina Republican concluded, ""I know Mike’s concerns about the voices of some members being silenced are sincere, but I believe his proposals to address these concerns are ill-advised."" The former GOP leadership aide pointed to the House of Representatives, suggesting Republicans are looking ""at what's happening in the House with a leader, the speaker in this case, who's been politically weakened by conference rules."" They said senators are seeing ""the chaos that episodically prevails"" in the House and are asking, ""Is this really what we want in the Senate?""  According to Bonjean, this feud ""helps to muddy the waters for Thune and Cornyn"" in their leader bids.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""What will be interesting to watch is the barometer of how many senators that will actually back up Sen. Lee’s trial balloon,"" he added.  Lee's ideas for the conference come as he and others have been left particularly unhappy with the relatively frequent late-night and last-minute spending packages, supplemental aid bills and re-authorization measures that have included what he considers to be Democrat priorities.

Businessman Eric Hovde won the Republican nomination for Senate in Wisconsin on Tuesday, setting up a competitive general election between himself and Democrat incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin.  Hovde was endorsed by former President Trump in his primary race and has already spent a seven-figure sum on his campaign.  He defeated lesser-known challengers Charles Barman and Rejani Raveendran handily in the matchup.

Hovde recently spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he slammed Baldwin as a ""rubber stamp"" for President Biden, citing her record of almost always voting in line with him.

29,Congress,2024,9,Dems look to force votes on emergency abortion as abortion pill deaths make headlines,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate President Pro tempore Patty Murray, D-Wash., and others revealed on Tuesday their plans to force votes on abortion-related bills in the wake of two pregnant women's deaths after taking abortion pills. In floor remarks, Schumer said, ""What happened in Georgia is a direct example of how abortion bans continue to exacerbate the racial disparities in maternal death. Amber’s doctors didn’t perform the medical procedures they knew she needed because of Georgia’s law."" ""It was the law overruling their good medical judgment. She went into septic shock and her heart stopped – all while doctors did everything except the medically-sound treatment she needed,"" he said, in reference to ProPublica's reporting on the deaths of Candi Miller and Amber Nicole Thurman.  JOHN CORNYN FLEXES FUNDRAISING CHOPS AS BATTLE TO SUCCEED MITCH MCCONNELL RAMPS UP Senate Democrats will look to hold a vote on a bill to codify Roe v. Wade on Wednesday. (Getty Images) Both of the women died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. In Thurman's case, according to ProPublica, doctors waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, which is not an abortion. Miller was found unresponsive by her family after suffering from the pill's complication.  ""Today, as you heard from the leader, we're going to try and pass this resolution, and we're going to see if the Senate can come together with one voice and tell women, ‘Women, we want to put your health first,'"" Murray said at a press conference.  The Washington Democrat attempted on Tuesday afternoon to advance her resolution to affirm ""the basic right to emergency health care, including abortion care"" for a vote by unanimous consent. However, it was objected to by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) The Democrats' attempts to force votes votes on abortion items came in response to the deaths of Miller and Thurman, which have caused a dispute over what is to blame.  ""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller are two Black mothers who lost their lives in Georgia due to the state's draconian abortion ban. Women who could have survived if they had been able to get the health care they needed. These are the consequences of Trump abortion bans,"" Murray claimed earlier this month.  Roe v. Wade was overturned in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022, which turned the authority to determine limitations on abortion back to the states. Former President Trump's appointment of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett is largely credited for giving conservative justices the majority and pushing the decision over the edge.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Other Democrats have echoed Murray's sentiment, including Vice President Kamala Harris, blaming the overturn of Roe v. Wade for the women's deaths.  Some conservative leaders and groups have pushed back on Democrats' characterization of the women's deaths, including top pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.  SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement, ""Pro-life laws are clear, yet politicians and the media are sowing confusion at women’s expense. Across the nation, pro-life laws allow doctors to provide emergency care, and doctors who fail to provide necessary medical care should be held accountable."" ""Pro-abortion Democrats and the abortion industry fearmonger and exploit tragedies resulting from abortions themselves, like the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller – leaving women confused about the law and scared to get care in emergency situations. These lies have real consequences, and we urge pro-abortion Democrats to value women’s safety over limitless abortion,"" she said.

30,Congress,2024,11,Rick Scott gains new Senate endorsements out of candidate forum on eve of leader election,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the president-elect's appointments on 'Your World.' Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., earned two more endorsements following what Republican senators described as a wide-ranging discussion with the three candidates to succeed outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. According to Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who held the leader candidate forum, the issues that Scott, Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, were asked about included those that were procedural, substantive and policy-related — such as the debt deficit and illegal immigration. The senators were also prompted on how closely they would work with President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Lee, who endorsed Scott before even exiting the meeting, said that the Florida senator is ""a little more aligned with the president's agenda."" JOHN THUNE SNAGS 2 MORE ENDORSEMENTS IN COMPETITIVE GOP LEADER RACE TO SUCCEED MCCONNELL Scott has received an influx of public endorsements. (Alex Wong) And while he doesn’t think Thune or Cornyn would ""deliberately"" seek to cause friction with Trump, he noted that ""past can be prologue in some ways."" Lee's comment was presumably in reference to Thune's once-fractured relationship with Trump, which he has since worked to repair.  Thune left the forum expressing satisfaction with the discussion, telling reporters there were ""lots of good questions."" When asked if he had a sense of the level of support behind him, the South Dakota Republican said, ""you never know until the voters vote.""

Another Scott-endorser, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who was the first to back him last week, was particularly pleased with the meeting.

But not everyone was impressed by the Florida Republican. ""Scott’s remarks didn’t do much to impress or sway members,"" one source with knowledge told Fox News Digital. ""He focused more on his time as a businessman instead of priorities for the Senate."" A Thune endorser, Sen.

The Fox News Decision Desk projected that Republicans will take back control of the Senate in 2025 once the 119th Congress is sworn in. The GOP officially won enough Senate seats in the 2024 elections to take the majority back from the Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has led the upper chamber since 2021.  Republicans had a significantly more favorable map in terms of which Senate seats were up for election this cycle than the Democrats.

Joe Manchin, I-W.Va. With a West Virginia win and retaining all incumbents who were up for re-election, the GOP would be at 50 members already.  Democrats were in a much more difficult position, expected to lose Manchin's seat and having to fight a tight battle for outgoing Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's Arizona Senate seat.

The party could not afford to lose practically any races in the 2024 elections, given their many vulnerabilities.  What made the 2024 elections even more difficult for Democrats to hang onto the majority was the sharp decrease in split-ticket voting. In several states, the races were very likely to be decided by the winner of the presidential race, as voters were expected to pick one party and vote for candidates in that column down the ballot.

55,Congress,2024,11,Dem Rep Ruben Gallego beats Kari Lake in battle for Arizona Senate seat,Julia Johnson,"The Associated Press projects Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., will defeat Trump-backed Kari Lake in the state's Senate race. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., has won the race for Arizona's open Senate seat, beating out Republican Kari Lake, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, according to The Associated Press Monday night. This was the final Senate race to be called, leaving the Republicans with a 53-47 majority. It’s still not clear which party will secure a House majority with a handful of races yet to be called there. Gallego has served in the House of Representatives since 2015, representing the 7th and 3rd congressional districts in Arizona.  ARIZONA DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFFICE SHARED WITH HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN SHOT AT FOR THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN A MONTH Kari Lake and Rep. Ruben Gallego competed for the open Senate seat in Arizona. (Reuters) Lake ran unsuccessfully for Arizona governor in 2022 and was defeated by Gov. Katie Hobbs, D-Ariz. Prior to her gubernatorial run, she was a news anchor for a local Arizona television station and worked in the media for 27 years.  After the 2022 loss, she challenged the results, citing fraud concerns in the state. Lake still contends that there were significant irregularities in 2020 and 2022, echoing claims that Trump and many of his supporters have made. The concerns have led to the Republican National Committee devoting significant resources to election integrity efforts.

Cartwright was first sworn into Congress in 2013, where he represented Pennsylvania’s 17th District before the state redistricted in 2018 and Cartwright was elected to represent the 8th District.  The 8th Congressional District is located in Pennsylvania’s northeastern region and includes cities such as Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, encompassing Wayne, Pike and Lackawanna counties as well as portions of Luzerne and Monroe counties.  Cartwright’s re-election campaign was closely watched because he represents one of just nine districts across the country where Democrats worked to defend their seats after former President Trump won the districts in the 2020 presidential election.

In March 2021, Biden signed Promoting Access to Voting, which states that ""executive departments and agencies should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information."" The plan has already come under scrutiny from Senate Republicans, who have called it a federal ""voter mobilization"" effort with ""potentially partisan impacts.""

Steve Daines tells Fox News Digital the GOP's in a 'strong position' to flip the Democrat-held Senate seat in Montana. Senate Republicans have a feeling that the battle to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is just beginning and that more contenders will make last-minute bids for the role after the general election in November.  One name that continues to be tossed around is that of Steve Daines, R-Mont., head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), who has notably refused to rule out the possibility of running for the top Senate GOP role.  A source with knowledge told Fox News Digital that earlier in the year, after McConnell's shock February announcement that he would not seek another term as leader, former President Trump shared with allies that he would like to see Daines run for the position.  The two get along well, which spurred Trump's desire to see the Montana Republican join the race, the source said.

70,Congress,2024,9,"Dems face tight timeline to confirm Biden-Harris judges, surpass Trump legacy",Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the administration's Israel strategy on 'Special Report.' President Biden and Senate Democrats are racing to confirm more judicial nominees than former President Donald Trump did while in office.  However, they face a difficult schedule to get it done, with several time-sensitive pieces of legislation due this fall and an entire month out of session in October.  Prior to the August break, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., announced that seven nominees had been advanced out of committee to be considered for confirmation. It's unclear when these votes will take place once the Senate is back.  MCCORMICK SAYS 'PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING' IMPORTANCE OF 2024 ELECTION AS PENNSYLVANIA SENATE POLLS TIGHTEN Democrats face significant time constraints in the Biden effort to appoint more judges than Trump. (Reuters) A spokesperson for Durbin told Fox News Digital in a statement, ""Senate Democrats are in a strong position to confirm additional Biden-Harris judicial nominees through the rest of the year. Chair Durbin will continue holding nominations hearings and markups through the end of the Congress, as well as push for floor votes on these highly qualified, diverse nominees who are bringing balance to the federal judiciary."" So far, Biden has appointed 205 federal judges in his term, compared to the 204 whom Trump had appointed, as of Sept. 5, 2020, according to the Heritage Foundation's judicial tracker.  Both Biden and Trump have put a renewed emphasis on the federal judiciary, each focusing on quickly facilitating as many appointments as they could during their terms. Their appointments during one term have rivaled those of their predecessors, who had double the time to confirm them.  POLITICAL HANDICAPPER SHIFTS MONTANA SENATE TO ‘LEANS REPUBLICAN’ AS TESTER FALLS BEHIND Biden hit the 200 appointments milestone in May.  (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Trump was particularly successful at appointing more judges to influential appellate court positions. In fact, Trump appointed nearly the same number of such judges in his sole term as former President Barack Obama did in both of his.  In May, Biden's White House had officially outpaced Trump at the same time in his term, appointing 200 federal judges. ""Judges matter. These men and women have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll them back,"" he said in a statement at the time, emphasizing his commitment to judicial appointments.  While Biden was ahead of Trump in the key metric of judicial appointments in the spring, he'd fallen back on par with the former president by August when the Senate departed Washington, D.C., for recess. The lengthy blocks of out-of-session time in both August and October pose a significant obstacle to Democrats in the Senate getting future Biden judges confirmed.  SENATE GOP BRACING FOR LAST-MINUTE LEADER BIDS — POTENTIALLY BY KEY TRUMP ALLY Chuck Schumer said the spending bill needs to be done in a bipartisan manner. (Reuters) Not only this, but several time-sensitive legislative fights are shaping up in Congress that are likely to take up valuable time. A partial government shutdown looms at the end of this month if Congress isn't able to agree on a spending deal before the deadline. This could prove difficult, as conservative Republicans in the House and Senate, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have demanded a six-month continuing resolution (CR) to keep spending levels steady until March, as well as an attached bill to require proof of citizenship to vote.  The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act's inclusion is likely to be a nonstarter for Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told Fox News Digital that the spending deal needed to be bipartisan when asked about the Republican-backed measure.

It is sometimes said that ""politics and sports don’t mix."" But frankly, politics is dotted with sports. And sports is utterly loaded with politics. Which brings me to the intersection of politics and sports. The end of the regular baseball season is near. The Cincinnati Reds (my team, by the way), just fired their manager, David Bell, after a disappointing season. There are still a handful of games left in the season. Other teams will likely show their skippers the door soon. Look for possible vacancies in Colorado, Miami, Toronto and perhaps the Los Angeles Dodgers – depending on how they fare in the postseason. But the Reds are a special case. There were high expectations with star players Hunter Greene and Elly De La Cruz. Lots of speed. Fresh talent. With one of the best starting rotations in the game, some believed the Reds could win the division and maybe even compete for the National League pennant after years as also-rans.

72,Congress,2024,10,Mayorkas rips 'politicized' atmosphere over FEMA disaster response amid GOP criticism: 'It sows distrust',Adam Shaw,"Lawrence Jones views the devastation from Hurricane Helene. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who has been a political lightning rod for controversy during the Biden-Harris administration, on Monday pushed back against what he claimed was ""intentionally false information"" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) work. ""I have not seen it ever before at this level,"" he said on MSNBC, speaking to host Jen Psaki. ""You and I both remember a time when an extreme weather event, a natural disaster, actually brought people together. Now, unfortunately, tragically, quite frankly, it is politicized."" Both DHS and FEMA have been under fire over their response to Hurricane Helene, with claims that it has diverted resources to illegal immigrants, has been delayed in its response, and is out of money. SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS ‘LACK OF LEADERSHIP’ IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: ‘ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED’  This split shows DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and a North Carolina resident. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein | Mario Tama/Getty Images) Much of the controversy was triggered last week when Mayorkas said FEMA ""does not have the funds to make it through the season."" He went on to say that the agency has the money for ""immediate needs"" but is concerned about not having a stable supply of funding. Congress recently freed up $20 billion for the disaster fund, but officials have called on Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill. Critics quickly pointed to FEMA's role in distributing more than $650 million in funds to help illegal immigrants as part of its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). Former President Trump recently accused the Biden administration of stealing FEMA money ""for their illegal immigrants.""  However, the Biden administration has noted that that funding, which comes from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is congressionally appropriated for grants to local governments and nonprofits, is entirely separate from the significantly larger Disaster Relief Fund. ""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA said in a release this week. HURRICANE HELENE: NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AS BASIC GOODS BECOME SCARCE It has still faced questions from some Republican senators about whether its ""entanglement"" in the border crisis has affected its operational readiness. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., meanwhile, told Fox News Digital last week that the administration has ""failed in that response."" ""They are scrambling to cover their egregious errors and mistakes. And there's an effort to blame others or blame circumstances when this is just purely a lack of leadership and response,"" the speaker said. FEMA also faced backlash last week after its unearthed emergency management ""equity"" blueprint went viral. The number one goal listed in the Biden-Harris agency's priorities is to ""instill equity as a foundation of emergency management.""  According to FEMA's plan, ""Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot be optional.""  This week, FEMA has been pushing back against claims that FEMA grants have to be repaid, that it is restricting airspace for rescue and recovery operations, and that it is distributing aid based on demographic characteristics. It has published a fact sheet to check some of those claims. Mayorkas, who was impeached by the Republican-led House this year, on Monday again stressed that there is help available for those who need it, and warned of the effects of misinformation.

Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican former Congressman Mike Rogers clashed over national security, immigration and abortion at a debate Tuesday as each candidate vies to be the next U.S. senator from Michigan.  Retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., has endorsed Slotkin, a three-term lawmaker who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District, to fill her seat. Rogers served in the House from 2001-2015, was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and has been endorsed by former President Trump.  This race in battleground Michigan is close, though Slotkin has enjoyed an average 5 percentage point lead in public opinion polls.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., discusses new whistleblower allegations about former President Trump's Secret Service protection on 'Hannity.' New whistleblower records allege a failure of the U.S. Secret Service to provide funding for Homeland Security ""jump teams"" and their travel to support security efforts on the campaign trail ahead of the November election. One email sent on Sept. 26 read, ""Subject: Jump Team ‐ Out of Money,"" according to a record obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and his oversight team.  The Department of Homeland Security's investigation unit jump team provides ""a mechanism to build the connections between mission support and the front-line,"" according to the DHS website.  FOR WISCONSIN DEMS, A 2024 WIN IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE IS YEARS IN THE MAKING Acting Director of Secret Service Ronald Rowe, left, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. (Reuters) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), an agency within DHS, is charged with addressing global threats.  ""Jump Team members are responsible for helping to solve immediate issues, guide how funding is allocated, and to assist in developing solutions to deliver support most effectively to our front-line,"" the DHS website added.  In the wake of two separate assassination attempts against former President Trump, who is currently campaigning to be president again, jump teams have been deployed to assist the U.S. Secret Service.  SEE IT: WISCONSIN DAIRY FARMER SAYS 'NO QUESTION' TRUMP ADMIN WAS 'MUCH BETTER' THAN BIDEN-HARRIS However, the documents provided to Grassley's office via legally protected whistleblower disclosures show that fears of unpreparedness and mismanagement in the DHS and Secret Service could still be true, despite efforts to ramp up security.  ""Please do not submit or resubmit Jump Team authorizations. There is only $33 on the line right now,"" DHS officials told HSI agents on Sept. 9, per Grassley. The senator's office pointed to this email as an example of just how low the funds had fallen.  On Sept. 26, agents were informed, ""We will not receive more money for Jump Team this year.""  The email instructed agents not to use the usual methods of expensing items, laying out a process of what to do instead.  ""If by some miracle money is added, you will be notified immediately,"" the email continued.  ""The Secret Service has a critical, no-fail protective mission to carry out. Based on protected whistleblower disclosures, it neglected to transfer enough funds for HSI to reimburse its agents, calling into question the agency’s ability to manage federal resources and raising major concerns,"" Grassley said in a statement.

According to Grassley's office and the documents it has obtained, agents have been required to pay for expenses the agency can't cover.

Reimbursements to agents are also apparently being delayed, and employees are left with uncertainty about their pay.  In a Wednesday letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas; acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe; Patrick Lechleitner, the deputy director and senior official performing the duties of the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Katrina Berger, HSI executive associate director, Grassley described that ""HSI agents are deployed, usually on very short notice, across the country on Jump Teams from as short as a few days for as long as multiple weeks, several times throughout the year."" TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT ""The whistleblower disclosures further show that in some cases HSI agents have had to pay for their own travel expenses such as flights, food, rental cars, and hotels, and other incidentals, because HSI has delayed reimbursing agents for costs due to the Secret Service failing to transfer funds to HSI.""

89,Congress,2024,8,Reporter's Notebook: What a 'yacht rock' summer looks like on Capitol Hill,Chad Pergram,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports that some Democrats are sitting out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech and the criticisms that congressional members should be ‘respectful’ to a foreign dignitary. A summer breeze has swept across Capitol Hill over the past two weeks. Not the ""Summer Breeze"" Seals and Crofts sing about, but a political summer breeze which made lawmakers ""Run Like the Wind"" for the exits. To quote Gino Vannelli, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle declared ""I Just Wanna Stop"" – and vacated Washington for the summer. BEWARE THE IDES OF JULY: TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, BIDEN ENDS REELECTION CAMPAIGN IN WILD MONTH One is wise to embrace this miniature respite in governance. The fall and winter will be a challenge in Congress. So here’s the ""Lowdown."" One can describe much of what unfolds on Capitol Hill in terms of ""yacht rock."" Lawmakers may be counting down the days ""Minute By Minute"" until they have to return to Capitol Hill in the fall, when election season will be in full swing. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Both bodies of Congress usually adjourn for a four- to six-week period between late July and early September. But this year’s congressional summer breeze has been more like a political gale. Lawmakers barely spent any time in session over the past few months. Both the House and Senate took off a week in the middle of July so Republicans could conduct their convention in Milwaukee. That was after an abbreviated week in Washington just after July 4th. Congress was out of session from late June until after the Fourth. The House ditched town early last month, lopping off one week of its schedule. In fact, the House has only convened for a handful of weeks since May 24. Yacht rock impresario Rupert Holmes would characterize this as an ""Escape."" Do you really need more of a reason to blend a piña colada? Expect Congress to accomplish much the rest of the year? Well, that yacht – has sailed. We’re deep into the throes of what is going to be a brutal campaign season for the presidency, control of the House and the Senate. All lawmakers are required to do the rest of the year is figure out a way to avoid a government shutdown in late September. Is Congress capable of much else? Well, doubtful. But in the words of the Doobie Brothers, ""What a Fool Believes."" A cryptocurrency bill? Maybe in the lame duck session, but doubtful. A tax bill – involving credits for parents? Same. How about legislation offered by GOP vice presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, to bolster rail safety after the Norfolk Southern crash in East Palestine, Ohio, early last year? Few are on board with that. Democrats don’t want to award Vance a legislative victory just before the election. And Republicans aren’t willing to help Brown. He faces one of the most competitive Senate contests in the country against GOP challenger Bernie Moreno. Like the Doobie Brothers and James Taylor, Sen. JD Vance is seen ""Takin' It to the Streets"" as he delivers remarks during a campaign rally on Aug. 6, 2024, in Philadelphia. (Drew Hallowell/Getty Images) A farm bill? Hey. Wrong genre. This is about yacht rock. Talk to John Cougar Mellencamp or Neil Young about that one. Lawmakers won’t necessarily don their captain hats and recline on the foredeck, catching rays and sipping a mai tai over the next few weeks. Democrats set their GPS for Chicago and their convention in two weeks. There are robust campaigns as Democrats try to cling to control in the Senate and stand a good chance of flipping the House. Democrats are especially enthused about their chances now that President Biden effectively ceded the Democratic nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris. Why did it take so long for Biden to defer to Harris – or anyone else? The Eagles would croon, ""I Can’t Tell You Why."" But since it's ""Just the Two of Us,"" Democrats were freaked out about bleeding seats down ballot. ""You’re Out to Lose,"" as Pablo Cruise might sing, had Democrats stuck with the incumbent. Republicans contend that 14 million voters cast ballots for Biden in the Democratic primaries earlier this year. They could even assert that Raydio was right when they penned, ""You Can’t Change That."" Biden was ""Still the One"" for several weeks after the debate debacle in Atlanta in late June. But once Biden stepped aside, Democrats quickly courted voters who may have abandoned them. ""Baby Come Back,"" by Player may have been the Democrats’ theme song as they attempted to woo people who considered sitting things out this fall. But some pols will welcome the early respite from Capitol Hill. Most House and Senate incumbents lack competitive races this fall. They might not find themselves in ""Margaritaville."" But who can blame them if they skip out of the 100-degree heat of Washington for a Caribbean destination? Former President Trump certainly has a contingent of ultra-loyalists who are happy to campaign on his behalf – or at least want to be seen as advocating for him. They may want to score a potential Cabinet post. Or at least duck the ire of the former president, so they attempt to appeal to his good graces. And many Democrats are now supercharged that Biden won’t be on the ballot. They will likely do all they can for Harris. So these lawmakers face a busy August and early September. But other lawmakers will coast. In fact, they may secretively ""Steal Away"" – in the words of Robbie Dupree. Perhaps you will find some of these politicians sipping chardonnay or a dry martini on a yacht somewhere as the sun sets across the water. You’d be lucky to catch them. Of course, you can always leave a message on their ""Answering Machine."" Not that anyone uses an answering machine anymore. Both Republicans and Democrats will be wishing they had some of Olivia Newton-John's ""Magic"" as election campaigns pick up and Donald Trump and Kamala Harris square off for the presidency. (Getty Images) Yacht rock might not capture all that’s going on in politics right now. One can understand the need to just check out of the political environment this month, especially after the drama involving Biden and the attempted assassination of Trump. Yacht rock is for summer. But when it comes to elections and governing, that is the season of classic rock. ""There must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief,"" declared both Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix in ""All Along the Watchtower."" But Congress will be back in due time in early September. Tens of millions of people will cast their ballots. And no one has addressed this as poignantly as The Who. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss. We won’t get fooled again,"" they sang. It may be enough for you to let loose one of Roger Daltrey’s signature screams. Which is why the ""yacht rock"" period of politics is much more pleasant. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

Mark Kelly and Vice President Kamala Harris (Getty Images) The Democratic senator's background as a 25-year Navy combat veteran puts him at a unique vantage point and makes him a very likely contender for a potential stint as the secretary of defense if he were interested. Similarly, Kelly's role as senator of a border state, who has made clear his concerns regarding illegal immigration, could leverage his standing on a list of possible DHS secretaries.  One sticking point for the Arizona Democrat in the 2024 election is respect for veterans and their families. ""Do you expect somebody, Donald Trump to really care about military families when he doesn't even care about the service members that have put their lives on the line and regard them as suckers and losers?"" he asked on Tuesday.

Tranel, the Democratic candidate running in Montana's First Congressional District against Republican incumbent Rep. Ryan Zinke, recently released a campaign ad appearing tough on the border. However, during her first congressional bid in 2022, Tranel claimed that the border crisis is unrelated to fentanyl trafficking while debating Zinke at the City Club Missoula. ""It is a significant issue where we are, but where it is coming from is not the southern border,"" Tranel said of fentanyl during the debate. ""It's being made in China, and how it's getting here is a complex series of things that are happening, and shutting down the border is not going to reduce the fentanyl crisis."" TOP HANDICAPPER GIVES GOP'S TIM SHEEHY EDGE AGAINST DEMOCRAT JON TESTER IS MONTANA RACE SHIFT Democratic candidate Monica Tranel is running for Congress against Rep. Ryan Zinke. (William Campbell) Shortly after Tranel's remarks at the debate, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that 36 million lethal doses of fentanyl had been removed from American communities between May to September 2022, with 35 cases linking directly to Mexican cartels. As she makes another bid for the Republican-held seat in 2024, Tranel is appearing to shift her stance on the issue.

In fiscal year 2023 alone, Border Patrol agents reported seizing enough fentanyl to kill the entire U.S. population. Asked about the previous comment regarding fentanyl, Tranel told Fox News Digital that ""we need to secure our border and solve the fentanyl crisis."" Tranel is running against Rep.

I also saw something more basic:  Our security depends on the United States maintaining an edge in advanced technologies.

Even then, state-of-the-art wireless technologies enabled the reconnaissance, radar and communications capabilities that kept my unit informed of fast-changing threats.

110,Congress,2024,9,Schumer sounds off on GOP plan to tie citizenship voting requirement to spending bill,Julia Johnson,"Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said there wasn't evidence that illegal immigrants vote in U.S. elections in response to a question about the Trump-backed SAVE Act to require proof of citizenship when voting. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., does not appear to be budging on a recent demand from conservative Republicans to include a Trump-backed voting bill in a must-pass stopgap spending bill at the end of the month.  ""As we have said each time we’ve had a CR, the only way to get things done is in a bipartisan way and that is what has happened every time,"" Schumer told Fox News Digital in a statement when asked if the measure's inclusion would be a nonstarter for Democrats.  House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rolled out a plan for a six-month spending patch called a continuing resolution (CR) on a lawmaker-only conference call Tuesday morning. Three sources familiar with the call said it would keep current fiscal year spending levels steady through March and would also include the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a GOP bill mandating proof of citizenship for voter registration. DEMS LOSE GROUND TO GOP CONTENDERS IN PIVOTAL SENATE RACES AS VOTERS LOCK IN: POLL Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, right, said the spending bill needs to be done in a bipartisan manner. (Reuters) Reaching a spending deal is necessary to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month, and the inclusion of the SAVE Act in that deal has been pushed by several conservative Republican members of the House and Senate in the weeks leading up to Congress' return from the August recess.  Johnson's office did not provide comment to Fox News Digital in response to Schumer in time for publication.  Former President Donald Trump has endorsed the SAVE Act and recently came out in favor of a six-month, short-term spending bill that includes it, such as what Johnson unveiled.

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, introduced the bill in the House. (Getty Images) Another strong proponent of the SAVE Act being attached to the spending bill is Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. ""This is already a bipartisan issue: a vast majority of Americans agree that voters should be able to show they are American citizens,"" he told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""If Senator Schumer and his fellow Democrats disagree with this commonsense measure to secure our elections, they should explain why."" The measure notably passed the House by a vote of 221-198 in July, with five Democrats joining their Republican colleagues. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas; Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas; Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine; Rep. Don Davis, D-N.C.; and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., voted in favor of the bill, making it technically bipartisan.  However, the relatively minimal backing from Democratic members of the House may not satisfy Schumer's desire for a bipartisan deal.  There has not been a vote on the bill in the Democrat-controlled Senate, and the majority leader is unlikely to schedule one.  BLUE-STATE REPUBLICAN TOUTS HIS ANTI-TRUMP CREDENTIALS IN BID TO FLIP SENATE SEAT RED President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' administration came out against the bill. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The Biden-Harris administration has previously come out against the bill, claiming it does not serve a purpose because it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote.  ""It is a Federal crime punishable by prison and fines,"" a statement of administration policy in July said. ""The alleged justification for this bill is based on easily disproven falsehoods."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Proponents of the measure see including the SAVE Act in the stopgap spending bill as a way to force Schumer and Democrats in the Senate to vote on it and go on record with their position.

That is the burning federal workplace question,Gleb Tsipursky,"'The Five' co-hosts react to rage over Larry David's attack on Elmo and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey taking a swipe at remote employees on The Fastest. Many federal agencies have implemented hybrid work models, allowing leaders to refine strategies to adapt to evolving employee needs and mission-driven objectives.  However, as the White House’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) releases flexible new guidance in August on federal remote work, it becomes evident that there is tension between this flexible approach and congressional legislative efforts such as the Back to Work Act of 2024. Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., introduced the Back to Work Act, a bipartisan bill that seeks to limit telework for federal employees to no more than 40% of their workdays per pay period. The legislation aims to compel federal employees to return to the office to address concerns about productivity, office underutilization, and the economic impact on local businesses that depend on office worker traffic.

113,Congress,2024,10,"How US government will dole out aid to victims of Hurricanes Milton, Helene",Chad Pergram,"Florida resident Jeff Travis explains why he is riding out Hurricane Milton at home on 'America Reports.' As the second major hurricane this month barrels toward the U.S. – this one promising to be even more devastating than the last – concerns are growing over how the government will help pay for what could become millions of dollars worth of damage. Is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) running out of money? Will Congress approve disaster relief? A Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report from August states that FEMA has $7 billion that can be directed to help with recovery from Hurricanes Milton and Helene. FEMA has a stash of money that was dedicated to recovery from older natural disasters dating back to ""Superstorm Sandy,"" which spun through the Northeast in 2012. But Fox is told the IG report ""gives an incomplete picture"" of how much money is available. FEMA disputes that all the money is recoverable, signaling that only about $4.5 billion is not obligated and could potentially be reprogrammed. That still means that some money is potentially available and could be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for ""immediate needs."" The DRF deals with the immediate preparation and aftermath of natural disasters. That includes providing food and shelter for people, rescuing people, providing immediate money to people, transportation, et al.  This view shows commuters driving eastbound on Interstate 75 away from Florida's west coast ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Milton on Oct. 8, 2024. (Reuters/Marco Bello) CATEGORY 3 MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA Fox is told that Congress would have to vote to ""reprogram"" the older money. Moreover, reprogrammed older disaster relief money can only go back into the DRF. It cannot be applied to a larger ""supplemental"" spending bill to help recover from these storms. The price tag there will likely be upwards of $1 billion.  It will be up to Congress to decide if it wants to reprogram some of that money to address immediate needs in the DRF once that pot of money starts to bleed dry after these two major storms.  Under the individual assistance program, the agency often quickly approves $750 for each household for food, clothes and everyday essentials.  Disaster survivors are also eligible to receive up to $42,500 in financial housing assistance. That can be used to repair homes or pay up to 18 months of rent. Applications for this program tend to take longer for FEMA to process. Other programs offer tens of thousands of dollars to help disaster survivors rebuild through the Small Business Administration, FEMA and other federal programs.  Meanwhile, lawmakers freed up roughly $20 billion in immediate funding for FEMA in last month’s short-term federal funding bill.  House Speaker Mike Johnson, R–La., predicted Helene’s devastation would be ""one of the most expensive"" the U.S. has seen. Initial estimates place private insured losses from Helene at around $11 billion. Milton, now rated a Category 3 hurricane, is expected to wreak even more havoc.

(AP Photo/Martin Zetina) HURRICANE MILTON: PROTECT YOUR HOME FROM LOOTING Congress is not expected to return early from a pre-election recess to deal with the problem. ""The thing about these hurricanes and disasters of this magnitude is that it takes a while to calculate the actual damages, and the states are going to need some time to do that,"" Johnson said on Fox News. But Fox is increasingly hearing from a number of conservatives who are ready to respond to the financial needs of Hurricanes Milton and Helene. They are happy to spend the money, but they are increasingly itchy about wanting spending cuts to offset the cost of the storm. Some of those requests may be for programs that address Democrat priorities. But a senior House Republican source disagrees that the offsets will ever come. ""That isn’t going to happen. That never happens,"" the source said. ""This will just go on the credit card."" While the idea of cutting elsewhere to produce offsets makes sense, it may be politically impossible. ""Tell me where you can get the votes to do it?"" asked the source, who declined to be identified. Moreover, the federal government is already into fiscal 2025 and there is no agreed-upon top-line spending number.  In addition, fiscal hawks tried to make similar cuts after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, but they failed. ""And it’s not going to work now,"" the GOP source said. Johnson said he was ""alarmed and disappointed"" by Biden officials’ comments immediately after the storm suggesting FEMA was too low on funds to deal with Helene’s wrath.

(Sean Rayford/Getty Images) Biden suggested this week he may want Congress to return for an emergency session to pass a supplemental disaster aid bill. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said ""we are meeting the immediate needs"" of the hurricane this week, but ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Criticism over FEMA’s response has prompted some conservatives to accuse the Biden administration of diverting disaster aid funds toward supporting illegal immigrants at the border through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), which was allocated roughly $650 million in the last fiscal year. Both the White House and Department of Homeland Security have vigorously denied any link between disaster aid and the SSP, beyond both being administered by FEMA, and have said claims of any disaster relief dollars being used to support migrant housing services are false.

FIRST ON FOX: A top Democratic House recruit drew a salary worth tens of thousands of dollars from a left-wing dark money network heavily bankrolled by George Soros’ political empire, Fox News Digital has learned. New York congressional candidate Laura Gillen, a town supervisor in the Long Island town of Hempstead, drew a $40,000 ""fellow"" salary with the group Our American Future Foundation (OAFF) in 2023, according to her financial disclosures. The group and a sister nonprofit, Our American Future Action, help pay expenses for individuals—overwhelmingly Democrats—who plan to run for office in the future. According to the Open Society Foundations, the umbrella of groups founded by Soros, its Open Society Action Fund has donated more than $18 million to Our American Future Action ""to support non-partisan policy advocacy and civic engagement.""  Tax filings show Our American Future Action is Our American Future Foundation's ""direct controlling entity."" HOUSE OVERSIGHT PROBES FCC'S EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF SOROS PURCHASE OF 200+ RADIO STATIONS AHEAD OF ELECTION New York House Democratic candidate Laura Gillen took part in a fellowship bankrolled by George Soros' political empire in 2023. (Laura Gillen Facebook/Getty) A spokesperson for Our American Future Foundation told Fox News Digital the funding went to Our American Future Action and that Our American Future Foundation ""has not received any funding from them.""  Our American Future Foundation also received direct support from the Soros empire. It got an undisclosed level of funding last year from the Jennifer and Jonathan Allan Soros Foundation, a charitable group run by one of the left-wing billionaire’s sons, tax filings show. Jonathan and Jennifer Soros have also donated to Gillen’s campaign directly, each contributing $3,300 this year. Another Soros son, Robert Soros, donated $2,900 to Gillen’s unsuccessful 2022 campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito. ""It is incredibly problematic that George Soros is paying candidates to run for office through a program disguised as a ‘fellowship,’"" said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

(Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""Voters should be seriously alarmed that Laura Gillen, who is claiming to run on ethics and transparency, is being personally propped up by a Soros group that is advocating for open borders, anti-police measures, and radical energy policies,"" Sutherland continued. ""This raises crucial questions about who Gillen will answer to if elected to Congress: the voters…or George Soros?"" Gillen has claimed that pointing out Soros funding for her campaign is responsible for ""antisemitic violence.""  Rep. Dan Goldman, a fellow New York Democrat, has also accused D’Esposito, whom Gillen is challenging again this cycle, of ""using a disgusting antisemitic trope"" by pointing out Soros' backing. Soros' groups have heavily funded organizations behind antisemitic protests since last year aimed at delegitimizing Israel and stopping U.S. support for its military campaign against the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Liberal billionaire George Soros' groups have heavily funded antisemitic protests since last year. (Getty Images) The Open Society Action Fund’s $18,055,000 in funding for Our American Future Action began in 2023 and was slated to finance activities stretching for 19 months, according to a grants database on the Open Society Foundations website. Tax filings indicate the Jonathan and Jennifer Alan Soros Foundation’s donation also came in 2023, the same year Gillen drew her fellowship salary. The fellowship program is designed to provide aspiring political candidates, overwhelmingly Democrats, with money to cover basic living expenses while they focus on future political campaigns. Several Democratic candidates in competitive 2024 contests have received funding from the group, including California’s Will Rollins, Nebraska’s Tony Vargas, Arizona’s Kirsten Engel and New York’s Josh Riley, according to the Washington Examiner. In March, the Examiner first reported that the nonprofit watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) was filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging OAFF’s payments to future House candidates violated federal law. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit, OAFF is prohibited from spending money on political activity. However, FACT alleged its payments to eventual candidates for office were explicitly designed to advance their political prospects. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The fellowship’s true purpose was explicitly described by its founder as a way to give money to failed candidates (or prospective candidates) for personal expenses in the brief downtime before they are able to file again to run for another office,"" FACT wrote in its complaint. ""Thus, the fellowship is directly tied to a federal candidacy and not for bona fide independent employment. Any claim otherwise would strain credulity."" Soros has also poured millions into several other groups and committees backing Democrats throughout the 2024 cycle. His two super PACs – Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II – have so far combined to shower left-wing groups with $53 million, Federal Election Commission records show. Gillen recently benefited from one of the groups financed by the left-wing billionaire. On Aug. 2, Soros’ Democracy PAC sent $500,000 to the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, which weeks later spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on independent expenditures backing her candidacy in the form of digital production, ad buys, and other items. During that time, the group also backed Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats. Gillen’s campaign and the Open Society Foundation did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Follow live coverage of Biden's State of the Union address on Fox News. One of the biggest crises of the Biden administration revolves around the southern border and the flood of immigrants entering into the country. President Biden backed a bipartisan bill to address immigration and provide additional border security funding, but many Republicans saw it as insufficient — and Biden has attempted to lay the blame on the GOP.  How Biden addresses the border, and whether he mentions Laken Riley – the student found brutally murdered in Georgia, allegedly by an illegal immigrant – will be crucial. But the White House pushed back on rumors that Biden would announce related to the border during his speech.                           This article was written by Fox News staff.

172,General Politics,2024,11,The Podcast Campaign: Is it curtains for mainstream media?,Howard Kurtz,"Former 2020 Biden-Harris campaign deputy communications director Meghan Hays and Fox News contributor Mary Katherine Ham discuss why the media may have turned on Kamala Harris on ‘MediaBuzz.’ There’s growing chatter that it may be time to play taps for the purveyors of traditional media. Much of the presidential campaign played out on television. But TV, along with print, is being written off as old news, a horse-and-buggy relic, the last of the dinosaurs to inhabit the earth. Now this is the point in the narrative where I say that podcasts and digital media are the hot new players, that the candidates made all kinds of news on these outlets, and that they’re more entertaining than organizations built around actual journalism. All true. I’m a podcaster myself. It’s a freewheeling forum. But the phrase making the rounds in conservative circles is this: ""You are the media now."" TRUMP, DEFYING MEDIA PREDICTIONS, MAINLY PICKS SEASONED CAPITOL HILL VETERANS SUCH AS MARCO RUBIO A side-by-side of President-elect Donald Trump and Joe Rogan. (Getty Images) And what that means is that anyone can have a voice. The average person can start a Substack page or a blog or a podcast and draw a following. The average person can sound off on TikTok, Instagram, Threads, Facebook and X. The corporate barbarians no longer control the gates. And this is a healthy thing. It opens up the national conversation and allows for unconventional and unorthodox ideas to circulate – such as that the Covid lockdown was not such a great idea and that the Hunter Biden laptop was not Russian disinformation. Elon Musk, in a pitch for X, has embraced the concept: ""Something's wrong with the press, guys. Journalism is dead. What the heck is going on? It's bizarre."" But the mirror image of everyone being the media is that everyone has to be a media consumer. The online world, as everyone knows, is filled with vitriol and conspiracy theories. It’s up to each person to filter that out (or not), and whether to stay in a cocoon that reinforces his or her opinions. WHY THE MEDIA WAITED TILL NOW TO ADMIT HARRIS RAN A LOUSY CAMPAIGN This is especially true in the Trump era, given his attacks on ""fake news"" and a basic disagreement on fundamental facts. Despite the president-elect’s stunning margin of victory, this is still a fiercely divided country with two diametrically opposed views of reality.  Charlie Warzel at the Atlantic has written smartly about this: ""Media institutions were somehow failing to meet the moment, but it was also unclear if they still had any meaningful power to shape outcomes at all. Elon Musk attends Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk session during the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 - Day Three on June 19, 2024, in Cannes, France.  (Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) ""News sites everywhere have seen traffic plummet in the past two years. That’s partly the fault of technology companies and their algorithmic changes, which have made people less likely to see or click on articles when using products like Google Search or Facebook."" But, says Warzel, ""audiences are breaking up with news, too. An influencer economy has emerged on social-media platforms. It’s not an ecosystem that produces tons of original reporting, but it feels authentic to its audience."" Yet the obituaries for traditional media are premature. Sure, it was a great idea for Trump to spend three hours with Joe Rogan and for Kamala Harris to appear on ""Call Her Daddy."" MEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS But when Harris spent a month hiding from the media, the pressure grew for her to do a sitdown television interview. She eventually did with CNN’s Dana Bash. Another major event was the vice president’s contentious interview with Fox’s Bret Baier. Meanwhile, the leaks on Trump’s appointees have mainly been to the big newspapers and cable networks. ""Special Report"" anchor Bret Baier’s interview with Harris drew a staggering 9.2 million total viewers, making it the most-watched non-primetime interview in cable news history. (Fox News Channel) So-called ""legacy"" outlets – which, by the way, all have major websites – do reporting as well as commentary. For all their flaws, they are slower because journalism takes time and mistakes are embarrassing. And even those who don’t trust these news organizations will cite them when it’s politically convenient: ""Even the New York Times says–"" In fact, for all of Trump’s use of Truth Social and self-posted videos, he cares about the legacy media as much as anyone. He talks to reporters virtually every day, even those he doesn’t like, and monitors the TV and newspaper coverage, so he can hit back at anything he deems inaccurate or unfair. And, as the campaign showed, he is impervious to the avalanche of negative coverage, and the consistently glowing coverage of Kamala didn’t help her in the end. Newspapers, while largely abandoned by younger people staring at their phones, also have an echo-chamber influence. The other day, The New York Times reported that lawyers at the Justice Department are worried about a Trump purge. The story was covered on cable all day long. Says Warzel: ""Independent online creators aren’t encumbered by any of this hand-wringing over objectivity or standards: They are concerned with publishing as much as they can, in order to cultivate audiences and build relationships with them. For them, posting is a volume game. It’s also about working ideas out in public. Creators post and figure it out later; if they make mistakes, they post through it. Eventually people forget."" The old run-and-gun approach. So I’m not buying the notion that traditional journalism is washed up, especially those outlets that do investigative reporting. They still play a pretty central role, which is why the campaigns spent zillions on TV ads.

My takeaway is that those of us in the news business now have to share the microphone with millions of other voices. And I’m not losing any sleep over that.

173,General Politics,2024,11,Washington Post set to lose $77 million this year even before boycott erupted over non-endorsement: Report,Joseph A. Wulfsohn,"Fox News' Howard Kurtz joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his take on Jeff Bezos' decision to not have The Washington Post endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. The Washington Post was already in financial trouble even before the recent boycott movement that erupted against the paper. A report from New York Magazine's Intelligencer shed light on a recent meeting at The Post newsroom where the top brass revealed that the paper was on pace to lose a whopping $77 million this year, a figure that does not even include the staggering 250,000 subscribers it lost over its last-minute decision by billionaire owner Jeff Bezos to not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in the final days of the presidential race. ""[It's] not a surprise at all,"" one Post staffer told Fox News Digital in reaction to the report. ""It means ‘buckle up.’"" Notably, the $77 million in reported losses mirrors the exact figure Washington Post publisher Will Lewis said in May the paper lost over the prior year.  WAPO STAFFER UNSURE PAPER CAN RECOVER AS BEZOS-OWNED OUTLET SHEDS 250,000 SUBSCRIBERS OVER ENDORSEMENT FIASCO  The Washington Post is reportedly on pace to lose $77 million this year, which doesn't include the losses from the recent boycott over its non-endorsement. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The Intelligencer cited other staffers, one saying ""The level of anger is through the roof, and fear is also through the roof.""  ""The top stories that do well convert 200 readers to subscribers,"" another staffer told the magazine. ""You’re doing your best work, hoping you convert 200 subscribers. And we lost 250,000 through naïveté and poor decision-making."" WASHINGTON POST NEWSROOM IN UPROAR OVER JEFF BEZOS' ‘TONE-DEAF’ OP-ED DEFENDING NON-ENDORSEMENT, STAFFER SAYS According to the report, The Post, which has suffered an exodus of high-profile talent in recent years, may have even more staffers fleeing, saying some of its ""most marketable journalists"" are ""seeking out opportunities at other outlets even as the grind of the new Trump administration begins."" A spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment on its revenue numbers when asked by Fox News Digital.  Billionaire Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post in 2013. ( SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) The Post's financial woes have formed a cloud over the ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" paper for years, but the newsroom was rocked with turmoil after Bezos halted the editorial board's endorsement of Harris, establishing a new policy going forward of not issuing endorsements for presidential candidates.  That was met with swift backlash both inside and outside the paper and resulted in the loss of 250,000 liberal subscribers, which NPR noted was roughly 10% of its 2.5 million total subscribers.  JEFF BEZOS ADDRESSES WASHINGTON POST ENDORSEMENT FIASCO, CITES DISTRUST IN MEDIA LED TO ‘PRINCIPLED DECISION’ The Washington Post was set to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris before it was halted by its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. (AP/Jacquelyn Martin) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bezos penned an op-ed defending the decision, citing growing distrust in the media.  ""We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement,"" Bezos wrote. ""Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose. Reality is an undefeated champion. It would be easy to blame others for our long and continuing fall in credibility (and, therefore, decline in impact), but a victim mentality will not help. Complaining is not a strategy. We must work harder to control what we can control to increase our credibility."" ""By itself, declining to endorse presidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the trust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it. That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy,"" Bezos later conceded.  Joseph A. Wulfsohn is a media reporter for Fox News Digital.

Trump was in Boca Chica, Texas, to watch SpaceX launch its Starship rocket for its sixth test flight when he was asked about Gaetz.  ""Mr. President, are you reconsidering the nomination of Matt Gaetz?"" Trump was asked.

(Brandon Bell/Pool via AP) ""No,"" Trump replied before walking away.  He didn't answer a question about how far he was willing to go to get Gaetz confirmed.  The nomination of Gaetz has come under fire because of the yearslong investigation related to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use allegations against him. He was previously under investigation by the Justice Department, but the agency decided against pressing charges.  The Florida Republican resigned last week, hours after he was tapped to serve as Trump's attorney general. The House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz began in 2021. The panel was slated to release a report about the allegations, but the resignation changed things.  MATT GAETZ FACES GOP SENATE OPPOSITION AFTER TRUMP SELECTION FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL ""Once the investigation is complete, then a report will be issued — assuming that, at that time, that Mr. Gaetz is still a member of Congress,"" House Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest, R-Miss, said when asked about the probe.  ""If Mr. Gaetz were to resign because he is taking a position with the administration as the attorney general, then the Ethics Committee loses jurisdiction at that point. Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued. That's not unique to this case.""

175,General Politics,2024,11,"Why Trump is sticking with Gaetz, Hegseth despite new accusations – and his 'Morning Joe' meeting",Howard Kurtz,"‘OutKick’s’ Tomi Lahren and former State Department official and top Hillary Clinton adviser Philippe Reines react to Trump’s Cabinet picks on ‘MediaBuzz.’ If you take a step back – make that several steps back – it’s easier to understand what Donald Trump is doing. Why would he deliberately ignite a media firestorm over such controversial nominees as Matt Gaetz and Pete Hegseth, and to a lesser degree with Tulsi Gabbard and RFK Jr.? The short answer is that the president-elect can’t run again and wants these nominees to disrupt – or even blow up – the departments they’d be in charge of running. And if they don’t have the usual credentials, if they’ve never run a large organization, he doesn’t give a damn. But wouldn’t it better serve his purposes to nominate equally disruptive Cabinet members who don’t have the baggage of a Matt Gaetz? But would they have the unquestioned loyalty? TRUMP, DEFYING MEDIA PREDICTIONS, MAINLY PICKS SEASONED CAPITOL HILL VETERANS SUCH AS MARCO RUBIO President-elect Trump is standing by his nominations of Pete Hegseth and Matt Gaetz to top-ranking Cabinet positions. (Roy Rochlin/Getty Images | Aaron Schwartz/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Even skeptical members of his inner circle have no choice but to let Trump be Trump.   If Gaetz were to become attorney general, for instance, he could fire FBI chief Chris Wray rather than Trump having to be the bad guy.  The thinking in Trump World is that the Senate won’t be able to reject more than two of his nominees. So even if Gaetz, who doesn’t appear to have the votes, is rejected, and perhaps Hegseth as well, everyone else gets through, including Kennedy and Gabbard. And wouldn’t it be hard for the Republican Senate, in the wake of such rejections, to be essentially obligated to approve the replacement nominees, given the magnitude of Trump’s victory? Is this 4-dimensional chess? White House chief of staff Susie Wiles was on the plane, with Gaetz, when Trump offered the now-former congressman the AG’s job. Whether Wiles, who ran a tightly organized campaign, knew about it or not, she had no power to stop it. Privately, some Trump advisers are opposed to the most radioactive picks, but they also know that the boss gets what he wants.   THE PODCAST CAMPAIGN: IS IT CURTAINS FOR MAINSTREAM MEDIA? The incoming Senate majority leader, John Thune, who’s not a Trump fan and was opposed by Trump, is deemed not likely to go along with recess appointments, which would be surrendering the chamber’s constitutional role of advise and consent. New reporting has complicated things for Gaetz and Hegseth, the decorated Army combat veteran and former Fox weekend host tapped to run the Pentagon.  The Washington Post scoop about Hegseth’s lawyer saying he paid off a female accuser who says he raped her in 2017, as part of a non-disclosure agreement, would sink a nominee under any other president. Hegseth, visibly intoxicated, says the encounter in his hotel room was consensual; the 30-year-old woman was at the conservative conference with her husband and small children. Speaker Johnson has pushed back against pressure to release the Ethics Committee's report on Gaetz. (Stephanie Keith/Bloomberg via Getty Images) In the case of Gaetz, House Speaker Mike Johnson doesn’t want the ethics committee report released, since the man has resigned his seat. Does anyone doubt that if this was a Democrat, he would take the opposite stance and denounce the nominee as a pervert?   In any event, a lawyer for multiple women making accusations of sexual misconduct told ABC that two of his clients say Gaetz paid them for sex. And he plans more interviews. Attorney Joel Leppard said that in their House ethics testimony, staffers ""essentially put the Venmo payments on the screen and asked about them. And my clients repeatedly testified, ‘What was this payment for?’ ‘That was for sex.'"" . MEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS Leppard had previously said that one of his clients had also watched Gaetz have sex with a minor. John Clune, another lawyer for a woman who contends that Gaetz had sex with a minor then in high school, called the Gaetz nomination ""a perverse development in a truly dark series of events."" And as CNN noted, one of the underage girls says she had sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table, according to her testimony. Reporting on Gaetz's alleged past has significantly complicated what was already a longshot nomination for attorney general. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) One thing is certain: Trump continues to support both nominees. He is not going to back down. By the way, if Kamala Harris had won the election, I’d be scrutinizing her nominees the same way. A number of pro-Trumpers online accused me of Trump Derangement Syndrome for covering the most controversial nominees, which is hilarious because the president-elect granted me two interviews in 10 months, one just a couple of weeks before the election, and told me that both were fair. Meanwhile, Trump’s decision to meet with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who have relentlessly bashed him for the last seven years, was a brilliant move. Both made the request, and Trump was magnanimous enough to grant them an audience at Mar-a-Lago – really a stunning development. As they explained yesterday on ""Morning Joe:"" ""We talked about a lot of issues, including abortion, mass deportation, threats of political retribution against political opponents and media outlets. We talked about that a good bit,"" Scarborough said. ""It will come as no surprise to anybody who watches this show, has watched it over the past year or over the past decade, that we didn’t see eye-to-eye on a lot of issues and we told him so."" 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOSTS HOLD FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH TRUMP FOR FIRST TIME IN SEVEN YEARS What they did agree on, Brzezinski said, ""was to restart communications."" She noted that her father, the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, ""often spoke with world leaders with whom he and the United States profoundly disagreed. That is a task shared by reporters and commentators alike. We had not spoken to Trump since March of 2020, other than a personal call that Joe made after the attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania."" Trump was ""cheerful and upbeat"" and ""seemed interested in finding common ground with Democrats on some of the most divisive issues."" ""Morning Joe"" co-hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough enraged liberals on social media after meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. (Getty Images) As for the expected liberal backlash for meeting with a man they’d described as a fascist, Mika turned it around: ""Why wouldn’t we?"" Trump later told Fox’s Brooke Singman: ""Many things were discussed, and I very much appreciated the fact that they wanted to have open communication. In many ways, it’s too bad that it wasn’t done long ago… ""In order to Make America Great Again, it is very important, if not vital, to have a free, fair and open media or press.""  MSNBC'S 'MORNING JOE' CO-HOSTS REVEAL THEY MET WITH PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP AT MAR-A-LAGO Trump also said of his meeting with the husband-and-wife MSNBC hosts that they ""congratulated me on running a ‘great and flawless campaign, one for the history books,’ which I really believe it was, but it was also a campaign where I worked long and hard — perhaps longer and harder than any presidential candidate in history."" ""We talked about various Cabinet members — both announced and to be announced. As expected, they like some very much, but not all. The meeting ended in a very positive manner, and we agreed to speak in the future."" And here’s the olive branch: ""I expect this will take place with others in the media, even those that have been extremely hostile."" Trump said he has ""an obligation to the American public, and to our country itself, to be open and available to the press."" ""If not treated fairly, however, that will end."" President-elect Trump was quick to pigeon-hole the media into a carrot-and-stick situation – treat him fairly this go-round, otherwise, his openness to press inquiries may meet a swift end.

177,General Politics,2024,11,Pro-life groups cautious on RFK Jr. nomination after evolving abortion views,Chris Pandolfo,"Shawn Carney, founder of 40 Days for Life, reacted to President-elect Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which deregulated abortion pills during the Biden administration. The nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has rankled some abortion opponents, who are concerned about his past statements expressing a liberal position on reproductive rights. Kennedy, a former Democrat who ran for president as an independent before backing Trump, has said in multiple interviews that while he's ""personally pro-life,"" he does not believe it's the government's role to interfere with a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. As recently as May, he said a woman should be able to have an abortion when she's full term, although he later walked that statement back and announced support for some restrictions on abortion. Pro-life groups that spoke to Fox News Digital expressed optimism about Trump's election win, noting his previous administration's strong support for their cause. But they are seeking clarification from Kennedy on how he would use the sweeping powers at HHS to shape regulations on abortion pills and control funding to abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. ""He certainly needs to change his position on abortion just in order to be consistent,"" said Shawn Carney, co-founder and CEO of 40 Days for Life. ""Look, if RFK wants to take away our Fruity Pebbles and our Cool Ranch Doritos — both of which are great American institutions — because they're unhealthy, you can't do that and also deny health care to a baby girl who survives an abortion or support abortion at 40 weeks."" PENCE SAYS HE OPPOSES RFK JR.'S NOMINATION FOR HHS SECRETARY BECAUSE OF HIS STANCE ON ABORTION Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visits ""The Story With Martha MacCallum"" at Fox News Channel Studios on Sept. 25, 2024, in New York City. (Jason Mendez/Getty Images) Kennedy did not respond to requests for comment for this story. His nomination was met with outright opposition from some pro-lifers, including former Vice President Mike Pence. ""The Trump-Pence administration was unapologetically pro-life for our four years in office. There are hundreds of decisions made at HHS every day that either lead our nation toward a respect for life or away from it, and HHS under our administration always stood for life,"" Pence said in a lengthy statement on the website for his Advancing American Freedom nonprofit Friday. He called Kennedy's nomination a ""departure from the pro-life record of our administration,"" citing Kennedy's past pro-choice statements.   ""If confirmed, RFK, Jr. would be the most pro-abortion Republican appointed secretary of HHS in modern history,"" Pence wrote. RFK JR. ASKS AMERICANS TO SUGGEST POLICIES FOR NEW TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: 'TRANSITION TEAM BELONGS TO YOU' The Department of Health and Human Services has a ""major impact on abortion access,"" said healthcare attorney Harry Nelson, founder and managing partner at Nelson Hardiman, LLP.  The Food and Drug Administration, a sub-agency of HHS, has direct power over the availability of the abortion pill, Mifepristone. Known by the brand name Mifeprex, the pill is taken with misoprostol in a two-drug regimen that first deprives an unborn baby of hormones it needs to stay alive and then causes cramps and contractions to expel the dead fetus from its mother's womb. The Biden administration has taken several actions to deregulate and increase access to Mifepristone by making it available via telemedicine nationally. Pro-life groups have fought in court to have that deregulation overturned. ""Their efforts earlier this year failed at the Supreme Court but having leadership atop FDA who are sympathetic would be a major impact and make this the biggest abortion issue in the country,"" said Nelson. Mifepristone, also known as RU-486, is a medication typically used in combination with misoprostol to bring about a medical abortion during pregnancy and manage early miscarriage. The Biden administration has taken several steps to deregulate the abortion pill.  (Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images) HHS also oversees grant funding via Title X and other programs for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Pro-life activists have urged the incoming Trump administration to defund these providers. Additionally, HHS is responsible for enforcing federal law that requires emergency care to stabilize patients, including women with health risks from pregnancy. The Biden administration has sought to use the law, called EMTALA, to require states to permit doctors to administer emergency abortions when the life of the mother is at risk. ""It will be interesting to see RFK’s impact and also how the Trump team around him change things,"" Nelson said. ""I don’t think this is an issue RFK is going to be personally passionate about. The Pro-life hardliners are going to be gunning for Mifepristone, and that will be the primary battle to watch."" BIDEN ADMIN TELLS DOCTORS TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY ABORTIONS WHEN NECESSARY FOLLOWING SUPREME COURT RULING Trump welcomes Kennedy to the stage at a Turning Point Action campaign rally at the Gas South Arena on Oct. 23, 2024 in Duluth, Ga. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) Kennedy has said that his position on the issue has evolved since learning about the rates of elective late-term abortions. During an interview with comedians Shane Gillis and Matt McCusker in May, Kennedy acknowledged, ""My position on abortion was that it should always be a woman's choice right up to the very end.""  ""In the ninth month, you're basically killing a child, right? My presumption was that [...] no woman is going to deliberately carry a child for nine months, then two days before it's born, abort it. Who would do that?""  However, he claimed to have changed his view after examining data regarding late-term abortions and finding out they are more frequent than he once believed. ""But then I learned I was wrong, that there are actually a huge amount, comparatively, of elective abortions at that time,"" he said during the interview. ""And my belief at that time is that at that time you have a wholly formed, viable child and the state has some interest in protecting that baby."" RFK JR. WANTS TO CLEAR OUT ‘ENTIRE DEPARTMENTS’ IN THE FDA Some pro-lifers are giving Kennedy the benefit of the doubt because they trust Trump's judgment. In his first term, Trump kept his campaign promise to nominate pro-life judges to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 after nearly a half-century of anti-abortion activism.  ""There's no question that we need a pro-life HHS secretary, and of course, we have concerns about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I believe that no matter who is HHS secretary, baseline policies set by President Trump during his first term will be re-established,"" Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life President Marjorie Dannenfelser said.  Brian Burch, president of CatholicVote, said Kennedy is not ""easily labeled.""  ""He has publicly admitted his comments on unlimited abortion were mistaken. He has also said abortion is a tragedy, and that we must help as many women as possible that want to keep their children,"" Burch told Fox News Digital.  RFK JR.

Burch told Semafor that the collaboration came months after Kennedy talked about his abortion views with his group and after they agreed ""we need to be spending an equal amount of money on helping women choose to keep their child as we are on helping them to get abortions.""  In comments to Fox News Digital, Burch praised Kennedy's advocacy against ""Big Pharma, Big Food and Big Government,"" saying these are issues the pro-life movement can readily work on with the Trump administration if Kennedy is confirmed by the Senate.  ""There is no denying that RFK is not your traditional pro-life advocate. For this reason, we will vigorously oppose any HHS effort to expand or promote abortion or abortion funding. But we are also confident that the reforms he is proposing will lead to a rethinking of the entire food, medical, and drug industry that enables our tragic abortion-minded culture,"" Burch said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life Action, told Fox News Digital that Kennedy ""was the only presidential candidate who admitted he was wrong about abortion in America and changed his mind.""  ""Whoever ends up at HHS, we are going to want to talk with them about how HHS has been weaponized with prejudice against pro-life Americans, including pro-life hospitals, and for more abortion,"" Hawkins said.  Still, others remain skeptical.  ""I don't think anybody has confidence that RFK would undo some of the Biden abortion policies. He hasn't shown that he has publicly supported abortion through 40 weeks,"" said Carney. ""I think many would say this is his only flaw.""  Fox News Digital's Timothy H.J.

President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chair spoke to ""America's Newsroom"" on Tuesday and told host Dana Perino that the legacy media's status quo needed to change. ""Jeff Bezos just recently did an op-ed where he said that Americans don't trust the news media. He said now they're the least trusted of all. And I think he's speaking a lot of truth there. So I think the status quo, particularly when it comes to legacy media, needs to change,"" Carr said. Trump tapped Carr, who is currently the senior Republican member of the FCC, to lead the FCC on Sunday. Perino asked Carr what the agency can do to help legacy media.  ""There's a lot the FCC can do,"" he said. ""Broadcasters are differently situated than other speakers. They get free access to a valuable public resource, the airwaves. And they're licensed by the FCC. And the exchange for that is they have to serve the public interest. I think it's important that we take another look at that, and we reinvigorate it.""

TRUMP TAPS FCC MEMBER BRENDAN CARR TO LEAD AGENCY: 'WARRIOR FOR FREE SPEECH' Carr said his top issues included looking at tech censorship. ""Free speech is the bedrock of our democracy,"" Carr said. ""And there's been this unprecedented surge in censorship over the last couple of years. And we need to restore Americans' First Amendment rights."" ""We have a real opportunity to get the economy going in creating jobs. When President Trump came in 2017, we were behind the 8-ball when it came to communications policy, and he turned things around. And that's exactly what is going to happen again. We need to free up more spectrum. We need to do permitting reform, when you talk about rural broadband. That's the key there. And No. 3 is the space economy,"" Carr added.

184,General Politics,2024,11,"CNN moves to keep reporter Alex Marquardt’s raise, promotion out of high-stakes defamation trial",Brian Flood,"CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings tore into prominent liberals who have pivoted to being friendly to President-elect Donald Trump after spending years demonizing him as a fascist and comparing him to Adolf Hitler. CNN moved last week to keep the fact that correspondent Alex Marquardt received a raise and promotion out of an upcoming defamation trial against the network, but U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young’s legal team believes CNN rewarding its reporter after a motion for punitive damages was filed is highly relevant.  CNN promoted Marquardt in 2023 to chief national security correspondent, an elevation from senior national security correspondent. The promotion came well after Young alleged that CNN ""destroyed his reputation and business by branding him an illegal profiteer who exploited desperate Afghans"" during a Nov. 11, 2021, segment on CNN’s ""The Lead with Jake Tapper,"" which was shared on social media and also repackaged for CNN's website.  Marquardt’s report is now at the center of a high-stakes defamation lawsuit that is set to head to trial in January. CNN filed a motion in limine, arguing that Marquardt’s contract negotiations are ""irrelevant"" and should be excluded from trial. NAVY VETERAN’S DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST CNN INCHES TOWARDS TRIAL AS JUDGE HEARS MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT CNN promoted Alex Marquardt in 2023 to chief national security correspondent. ((Photo by Sylvain Gaboury/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images)) ""Plaintiffs apparently intend to introduce evidence information concerning CNN report Alex Marquardt’s contract negotiations with CNN and his subsequent promotion in 2023, two years after CNN published the publication at issue in this case. However, evidence related to Mr. Marquardt’s contract negotiations and promotion is not germane to any element plaintiffs must prove to sustain their defamation case,"" CNN’s lawyers argued in a filing obtained by Fox News Digital.  ""Nor such is evidence relevant to Plaintiffs’ claim for punitive damages, given that Mr. Marquardt’s contract negotiations and promotions significantly post-dated publications,"" CNN’s legal team continued. ""Punitive damages may be imposed only if the defendant acted with ‘gross negligence’ or engaged in ‘intentional misconduct’ at the time the tort was allegedly committed.""  Young’s lead counsel Vel Freedman disagrees and believes Marquardt’s work and position history, ""including promotions that postdate the events at trial,"" go directly to his background as a witness. His ""bias as both a very senior CNN employee… and as evidence that he has been rewarded and may be loyal"" are relevant to the jury’s ability to assess his credibility, Freedman argued.  ""Moreover, the fact that CNN was aware of Marquardt’s alleged misconduct in this litigation, investigated it, put his contract negotiations on hold, and then promoted him to chief national correspondent is admissible evidence that goes directly to the entitlement of punitive damages,"" Freedman wrote.  ""Marquardt, as the architect of the segment, is a central witness in this case,"" Freedman added. ""Plaintiffs are entitled to question him about his background and employment history.""  DEFAMATION LAWSUIT AGAINST CNN COULD EXPOSE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL SECRETS AS COURT SEEKS TO EXPOSE NET WORTH CNN host Jake Tapper and correspondent Alex Marquardt during the segment at the center of a defamation lawsuit.  (CNN/Screenshot) At a recent hearing, it was disclosed that CNN paused Marquardt’s contract negotiations after Young filed a motion for punitive damages and then promoted the reporter after negotiations were put ""on hold for a bit."" Freedman believes Marquardt’s promotion, raise and loyalty to CNN are ""essential facts necessary for the jury to evaluate his credibility."" ""Marquardt’s contract freeze and then promotion is also plainly relevant under First DCA precedent because the ‘attitude and conduct of the enterprise upon discovery of the misconduct’ are important considerations in determining whether punitive damages are warranted,"" Freedman wrote.  ""CNN rewarded the primary reporter responsible for the segment with a promotion. It is difficult to think of evidence more relevant to CNN’s attitude concerning its own misconduct,"" Freedman continued. ""In determining punishment and deterrence, a company’s response to allegations of wrongdoing is incredibly important."" Young’s counsel added that ""whether CNN rewarded Marquardt in the face of these allegations is not tangential relevance, as CNN claims, but a cornerstone of the reprehensibility analysis.""  ""If CNN did not act to punish wrongdoing -- and instead rewarded its principal architect with a promotion and a salary increase – a punitive damage award is all the more necessary to deter wrongdoing in the future,"" Freedman argued.  CNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Freedman declined comment.  Judge William Henry indicated he would rule as fast as possible.   A civil trial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 6 in the Circuit Court for Bay County, Florida.  The CNN segment at the center of the suit began with anchor Jake Tapper informing viewers that Marquardt found ""Afghans trying to get out of the country face a black market full of promises, demands of exorbitant fees, and no guarantee of safety or success."" CNN FACES DEFAMATION SUIT OVER AFGHANISTAN WITHDRAWAL STORY: 'EVIDENCE OF ACTUAL MALICE' Plaintiff Zachary Young’s photo was aired by CNN during the segment in question.  (CNN/Screenshot) Tapper tossed to Marquardt, who said ""desperate Afghans are being exploited"" and need to pay ""exorbitant, often impossible amounts"" to flee the country. Marquardt then singled out Young, putting a picture of his face on the screen and saying his company was asking for $75,000 to transport a vehicle of passengers to Pakistan or $14,500 per person to end up in the United Arab Emirates. ""Prices well beyond the reach of most Afghans,"" Marquardt told viewers.  CNN’s on-screen chyrons declared they ""face black market, exorbitant fees,"" but Young says he never took money from an Afghan citizen, who needed a sponsor to cover the cost. ""CNN can’t point to any evidence… there can’t be any evidence because it didn’t happen,"" Freedman told the judge at a previous hearing.  No other people or companies were named other than Young, who alleged that CNN, using the terms ""black market,"" ""exploit"" and ""exorbitant,"" inaccurately painted him as a bad actor preying on desperate people.  Internal communications between CNN employees that were revealed during the discovery process have indicated editors were concerned about the segment but aired it anyway. Other internal communications revealed CNN employees used profanities and disparaging language when privately discussing Young.

The panelists also discuss confusion stemming from a Parkinson's expert's visits to the White House. The White House has still not released its visitor logs for July, the month President Biden gave up his re-election bid, leaving questions about who was seeing and advising the president before he made the historic decision to drop out.  Despite consistently releasing visitor records at the beginning of each month throughout Biden’s term, the White House as of mid-November is far past its usual timeline for releasing guest records. It released its most recent logs on Oct. 4. These records covered visits to the White House until June 26. PRESIDENT BIDEN ADMITS PRESSURE FROM DEMOCRATS CONTRIBUTED TO DECISION TO DROP OUT President Biden (AP Photo/Evan Vucci/File) At the beginning of Biden’s presidency, media outlets praised the Biden administration for resuming the release of visitor logs after the Trump administration stopped the practice during his term. The New York Times spoke highly of the practice as ""part of an effort to restore transparency to government.""  This practice revealed that Dr. Kevin Cannard, a top Parkinsons disease expert, made several visits to the White House in 2024, increasing anxieties about the 81-year-old president’s health and physical fitness. After Biden’s poor debate performance on June 27, pressure for him to resign quickly mounted. But Biden did not drop out of the race until July 21. White House visitor logs would reveal who was close to the president in that critical month.

(Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty Images) This has led some, such as Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the right-leaning government watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, to question the Biden administration’s reason for delaying publishing its records.  Sutherland criticized the Biden administration for failing to deliver on its promise and leaving the American people in the dark.  ""The American people still don’t know who was coming and going from the seat of power in the lead-up to Joe Biden’s ouster and Kamala’s coronation,"" Sutherland told Fox News Digital.  ""At the outset, the Biden-Harris administration promised truth and transparency,"" she added. ""Now, in the dwindling days of their term, their refusal to release White House visitor logs from such a tumultuous period illustrates just how hollow that promise was."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Andrew Bates, a White House representative, responded to these criticisms by calling Americans for Public Trust a ""dark money group"" and pointing to the fact that the Trump administration did not publish any of its visitor records for the entirety of his term. ""It’s intriguing that this right-wing dark money group was silent for years as the Trump administration stopped sharing White House visitor logs with the public, but they have now abruptly developed an interest in transparency about records that we’ll be releasing in the near future,"" he said. ""We appreciate them inadvertently highlighting that Joe Biden leads the most transparent administration in American history."" Bates did not comment on when the White House plans on releasing its July visitor records or what has been the cause of the delay. Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

189,General Politics,2024,11,Former Trump Education secretary lays out 'unfinished business' for new admin on school reforms,Jamie Joseph,"Betsy DeVos, a potential Trump pick for Secretary of Education, backs block grants, school choice, and FAFSA reform to boost student outcomes. President-elect Donald Trump's first Department of Education (DOE) secretary, Betsy DeVos, has been floated as one of the potential candidates for the position again. However, if she does not get the job, DeVos has some ideas about who would be a good fit to carry the mantle Trump started in 2017. ""There's a whole host of Republican governors who have led on issues around at K-12 education, in particular, and in other cases, higher education,"" DeVos told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""They have great backgrounds and could do a great, great job in carrying out the policies of a second Trump administration. Which I believe, as President Trump has said, should definitely include every effort to depower the federal agency and turn control and power back over to states, local, districts and parents."" BETSY DEVOS JOINS TRUMP'S CALL TO ‘DISBAND’ THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND ‘RE-EMPOWER’ FAMILIES Education Secretary Betsy DeVos speaks during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the budget on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, March 26, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) GOP-dominated legislatures in Florida, Iowa, Arkansas and elsewhere passed bills significantly expanding school vouchers last year.  On the campaign trail, Trump said one of the first things he'll do is ""closing up the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., and sending all education and education work it needs back to the states."" DeVos said the budget and investments in education would not change, but through ""block granting."" ""Let's talk about eliminating the bureaucracy, not the budget, and ways in which that can be done,"" DeVos said. ""Very simply, block granting the money back to the states, so that it goes to states and ideally directly it to families who need it most."" TRUMP'S FORMER EDUCATION SECRETARY SAYS SHE IS ‘VERY OPEN’ TO DISCUSSION ABOUT RETURNING TO PREVIOUS POST Former President Donald Trump arrives for a campaign rally at Lancaster Airport on Nov. 3, 2024 in Lititz, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) During Trump's first term, DeVos strongly advocated for school choice policies and expanding school voucher programs and tax credit scholarships to allow public funding to be used for private and religious school tuition. She also rescinded federal guidance on the use of bathrooms by transgender students in schools, arguing it should be a state and local decision.  DeVos scaled back federal oversight and programs in K-12 education, including the scope of civil rights investigations conducted by the DOE. DEM REP RUBEN GALLEGO BEATS KARI LAKE IN BATTLE FOR ARIZONA SENATE SEAT Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos strongly advocated for school choice policies and expanding school voucher programs and tax credit scholarships to allow public funding to be used for private and religious school tuition. (iStock) ""This is unfinished business from the first term, when we introduced with President Trump's support and urged a freedom, a tax credit freedom bill to establish a pool of funds that individuals could designate money to at the federal level, but it would go alongside what states are already doing,"" DeVos said.  ""Many states have passed education freedom policies to support families making those choices in that state, and other states have not yet done that, but this would allow for kids in every state through scholarship granting organizations to experience more education, freedom and choices and options, and that is a really important piece that should be addressed. And I believe this new Congress is ready to jump into it,"" she added. On the contrary, President Biden increased funding for public schools, particularly in low-income areas, through the American Rescue Plan during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Throughout his presidency, Biden pushed for college student debt relief, despite being blocked by the Supreme Court. Biden's Education Department is trying to push through a new federal rule in the final weeks before President-elect Trump takes over to provide additional student loan forgiveness for 8 million borrowers who face financial hardships.  If finalized, the new rule would authorize student debt forgiveness on a one-time basis for people who the department considers to have at least an 80% chance of defaulting on loans based on a ""predictive assessment using existing borrower data."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP    The rule would also allow people, including potential ""future borrowers,"" to apply for relief that will be awarded based on ""a holistic assessment of the borrower’s hardship."" ""There is every argument for if the taxpayers are going to be funding student lending, there better be ways to oversee it and actually do it effectively and efficiently,"" DeVos said. ""And it has not been happening. It is a huge mess, and it needs to be rethought and re-examined, and frankly, the private sector, private sector lending needs to come back into it and be an option.""

190,General Politics,2024,11,"How Trump and Speaker Johnson could force the Senate to adjourn, allow recess appointments",Elizabeth Elkind,"Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker calls the hundreds of thousands of missing migrant children in the U.S. a 'humanitarian crisis' on 'America Reports.' Some Capitol Hill Republicans are already starting to deliberate whether President-elect Trump has a constitutional pathway to adjourn Congress himself in order to clear any possible resistance to his Cabinet appointments. Trump argued earlier this month in a post on Truth Social that ""recess appointments"" would enable his new administration ""to get people confirmed in a timely manner."" The Constitution grants the president authority to appoint Cabinet officials when the Senate is out of session, a period of time known as ""recess,"" bypassing the traditional Senate confirmation process.  Trump allies are exploring whether a constitutional clause would enable House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to work with Trump to shut down Congress even if the Senate objects – clearing the way for his recess appointments. MIKE JOHNSON WINS REPUBLICAN SUPPORT TO BE HOUSE SPEAKER AGAIN AFTER TRUMP ENDORSEMENT Some Republican legal circles are evaluating whether President-elect Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson can work together to force the Senate into recess. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The passage in question would allow the commander in chief to ""on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper."" If Johnson proposes to take the House and Senate out of session and the Senate resists, then there is ""disagreement,"" the theory goes, and Trump could send everyone home for as long as he wants. ""We're still looking at that,"" Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, chair of the House Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on the Constitution and Limited Government, told Fox News Digital. ""I'm actually talking to a bunch of folks who have been a part of litigating this in the past… reviewing it to kind of figure out the history and the contours of that particular provision, because that's kind of in the zip code of unprecedented."" He said there was ""zero question that the House and Senate can choose to adjourn,"" at which point Trump could make his recess appointments.  ""We just kind of gotta work through what is the position of the House and the Senate on adjourning and then figure out… that specific question,"" Roy said. Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., told Fox News Digital, ""I have heard that there were some discussions about that, whether it is already currently allowed or procedurally correct, but not that much."" MATT GAETZ FACES GOP SENATE OPPOSITION AFTER TRUMP SELECTION FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL Rep. Chip Roy said the question was being evaluated but is ""unprecedented."" (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) ""I think basically, what we’re really, really talking about is, should the president be able to have the people confirmed that he has selected to help him pursue and pass his agenda?"" Rosendale said. ""I think that he should be allowed to have the people confirmed that are going to help him pass his agenda… I do also believe that we have to be very careful of breaking norms, because we saw [ex-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.] do that on many occasions, and it does hurt the institutions."" There’s currently disagreement among legal experts over whether the move is even possible. REPUBLICANS PROJECTED TO KEEP CONTROL OF HOUSE AS TRUMP PREPARES TO IMPLEMENT AGENDA ""The whole idea that a president could conspire with the House to eviscerate the Senate’s advice and consent for a nomination is outrageous,"" Edward Whelan, a distinguished senior fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, told Fox News Digital. ""The mechanism that they have in mind to do that would not work. … The House of Representatives has no authority to try to prevent the Senate from staying in session. And its objection to the Senate doing so cannot plausibly create the sort of disagreement that would trigger a presidential authority to adjourn both houses."" The nomination of former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general has caused some heartburn within the GOP. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) Mike Davis, founder of the Article III Project and a former senior aide to the Senate Judiciary Committee, told Fox News Digital he believed the clause was there specifically for such a time. ""The Senate’s job is to provide advice and consent. The American people overwhelmingly elected President Trump in a landslide victory. The American people expect the Senate to confirm all of President Trump’s qualified nominees,"" Davis said. ""If the Senate refuses to do that, the Constitution provides a mechanism for the president and the executive brand to [sidestep] them."" The idea has struck some within the House GOP as preposterous – particularly in relation to former Rep. Matt Gaetz’s nomination by Trump for attorney general. ""The speaker should not do that. And my hope is that the Senate president will have more of a backbone,"" one Republican lawmaker told Fox News Digital when granted anonymity to speak freely. JOHNSON BLASTS DEM ACCUSATIONS HE VOWED TO END OBAMACARE AS 'DISHONEST' ""If he wanted recess appointments, nominating Matt Gaetz was the worst thing he possibly could have done… when you throw him in there, you just kill it easily because you just scared the crap out of, I don't know, probably 30 or 40 Republican senators."" But Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who told Fox News Digital she’s heard ""multiple strategies"" for helping the president-elect get recess appointments through, said, ""Yes, we’re going to get the appointments done,"" even if Senate Republicans don’t fully comply. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene signaled she would support Johnson working with Trump to bypass the Senate if necessary. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) ""I'll just tell you this. If these senators oppose President Trump's appointments, they are openly declaring war on President Trump and his incoming administration,"" Greene said. ""They need to sit down and get out of the way, because it's not going to be tolerated."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Johnson himself appeared to leave the door open to such a strategy during an interview with ""Fox News Sunday"" when asked about the constitutional theory. ""I wish the Senate would simply do its job of advice and consent and allow the president to put the persons in his Cabinet of his choosing. But if this thing bogs down, it would be a great detriment to the country, to the American people,"" Johnson said. ""They have sent the message that America First policies should be the rule of the day… So we'll evaluate all that at the appropriate time and we'll make the appropriate decision. There may be a function for that, and we'll have to see how it plays out."" When reached for comment, Johnson's office referred Fox News Digital to his Sunday show appearance and pointed out comments from earlier on Tuesday in which he said, ""I think it's an important principle for us to maintain that an incoming president gets to select their own team. I think, I think that's an important principle. The advise and consent responsibility is given to the Senate and the Constitution. They need to take that seriously, and they will. They'll properly vet nominees, and that process will play out. But look, I'll just say this about a number of the nominees that have been appointed — I think President Trump is looking for persons who will shake up the status quo, and we got a mandate in this election cycle to do that the status quo is not working for the American people.""

192,General Politics,2024,11,Dems sue PA election board over uncounted provisional ballots amid Senate recount in Casey loss,Breanne Deppisch,"Fox News correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on the down-ballot races in Pennsylvania after the swing state jolted President-elect Trump towards 270. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee filed a lawsuit Monday over the counting of dozens of provisional ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, alleging that rejecting the ballots violates both the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution and other protections for voters. The lawsuit, which the DSCC filed in state court against the Bucks County Board of Elections on behalf of Sen. Bob Casey, is the latest in a flurry of legal action in the Keystone State as it begins its official Senate election recount.  The case centers on 74 provisional ballots in Bucks County that were disqualified because they lacked an inner ""secrecy envelope"" required for provisional ballots in the state. REPUBLICANS FILE 12 PENNSYLVANIA LAWSUITS IN 'AGGRESSIVE' PUSH TO END RECOUNT Republican Senate candidate Dave McCormick speaks during a campaign event in Pennsylvania. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Lawyers for the Democratic Party argued in the court filing that the provisional ballot errors were the ""direct result"" of inaccurate instructions from poll workers, rather than the voters themselves, and therefore violated both the due process clause and the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which states that ""an individual's provisional ballot ""shall be counted... in accordance with state law"" if election officials determine that the individual is eligible to vote.   By excluding these provisional ballots that were the result of poll worker errors, lawyers argued, the Bucks County Board of Elections ""unlawfully disenfranchises"" voters and harms Casey’s electoral prospects. The lawsuit centers on just 74 ballots, making it unlikely it will have any significant impact on the recount in Pennsylvania.  But it comes amid a flurry of recent lawsuits in the Keystone State, where Republican candidate David McCormick narrowly edged out Casey by just 17,000 votes, according to unofficial data from the Department of State – putting Casey well within the 0.5% margin of error required under Pennsylvania law to trigger an automatic recount.

(Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images) The Senate recount began Monday, and will continue through Nov. 26. Republican Party officials have argued that the results have been decisive and that Casey lacks any achievable path to victory. They have also criticized Casey for declining to waive the recount, noting that it will cost taxpayers an estimated $1 million.  McCormick, for his part, called for a recount of his own in 2022 after he was beaten in the Republican Senate primary by TV celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz. News of the lawsuit comes after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Monday that mail-in ballots with incorrect or missing dates cannot be counted in the 2024 election, delivering a victory to Republican Party officials as they moved to aggressively defend their narrow Senate victory. President Biden and Sen. Bob Casey visit the Allentown Fire Training Academy in Allentown, Pennsylvania. (Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images) Casey's campaign used news of the DSCC lawsuit to reiterate their criticism of the many Republican-led lawsuits that have been filed in the commonwealth, and which they have suggested risk disenfranchising voters. ""Thousands of Pennsylvanians’ votes are in question across the commonwealth as David McCormick and national Republicans work to throw out ballots cast by eligible voters and accepted by county election boards,"" a spokesperson for the campaign told Fox News Digital.

195,General Politics,2024,11,Trump Cabinet picks increase odds Edward Snowden could see life of freedom in the US,Morgan Phillips,"President Trump says he will take a 'very good look' at possibly pardoning Edward Snowden and bringing him back to America If President-elect Donald Trump has his way, Tulsi Gabbard will be at the helm of U.S. intelligence and Matt Gaetz will be leading the Justice Department, giving whistle-blower Edward Snowden his best chance yet at a life of freedom in the U.S. Both Gabbard, a former Hawaii House Democrat, and Gaetz, a former House Republican from Florida, will have to be confirmed by the Senate — an uphill battle that may be made more difficult by their anti-establishment beliefs that Snowden should not be punished for revealing information about classified surveillance programs. As members of Congress, both Gabbard and Gaetz co-sponsored legislation that called on the federal government to drop all charges against Snowden. During her 2020 presidential campaign, Gabbard promised to protect Snowden and people like him, if elected.  ""If it wasn’t for Snowden, the American people would never have learned the NSA was collecting phone records and spying on Americans,"" she said on ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast at the time. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ SPARKS BACKLASH FOR CLAIMING TULSI GABBARD IS A RUSSIAN ASSET If President-elect Donald Trump has his way, Tulsi Gabbard will be at the helm of U.S. intelligence and Matt Gaetz will be leading the Justice Department, giving whistle-blower Edward Snowden his best chances yet at a life of freedom in the U.S.  ""As president, I will protect whistle-blowers who expose threats to our freedom and liberty,"" Gabbard added. On Sept. 3, 2020, Gaetz posted to X: ""Pardon @Snowden."" In 2013, Snowden was working as an IT contractor for the National Security Agency when he traveled to Hong Kong to meet with three journalists and transferred them thousands of pages of classified documents about the U.S. government’s surveillance of its citizens.  He then traveled to Russia and planned to head on to Ecuador, but federal authorities canceled his passport before he could get there — and indicted him for espionage. He attempted to gain asylum elsewhere, but ultimately remained in Russia and became a naturalized citizen in 2022. The documents he made public revealed previously classified intelligence-gathering programs run by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the U.K.’s intelligence organization, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), that were conducting surveillance on their own citizens.

When running for president as a Democrat in 2020, Gabbard promised to pardon Snowden. (Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Gaetz co-sponsored legislation that would drop charges against Snowden. (Reuters) At the time of the leak, the NSA claimed mass surveillance stopped terrorist attacks. Sue Gordon, deputy director of national intelligence during the first Trump administration, issued a warning about Gabbard’s push for Snowden to be pardoned on CBS this week.  ""Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don’t go with the good or bad, any good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths, and he harmed America,"" she said.  ""He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners, and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that. There is nothing justifiable about what he’s done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they’re basically saying is all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don’t matter anymore."" In 2013, Trump was asked about Snowden. ""This guy is a bad guy and there is still a thing called execution!"" he said.  But on the campaign trail in 2020, he struck a more sympathetic tone, saying he'd ""look at"" giving Snowden a pardon. Snowden, in 2019, said he is not searching for a pardon, but rather a fair trial in order to return to the U.S.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""One of the big topics in Europe right now is — should Germany and France invite me in to get asylum?… And of course, I would like to return to the United States.

And that’s the one thing the government has refused to guarantee because they won’t provide access to what’s called a public interest defense,"" the whistleblower said. ""I’m not asking for a parade. I’m not asking for a pardon. I’m not asking for a pass. What I’m asking for is a fair trial. And this is the bottom-line that any American should require.""

With 94% of the votes counted, Democrat Derek Tran now leads GOP Rep. Michelle Steel by 102 votes in California’s 45th Congressional District after Steel had maintained a lead since Election Day.  Steel, born in Seoul, South Korea, and raised in Japan, has represented the 45th District since 2023 and represented the 48th Congressional District before that, from 2021 to 2023.

197,Congress,2024,11,Gaetz-gate: Navigating the President-elect's most baffling Cabinet pick,Chad Pergram," Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the balance of power amid the Trump transition on 'Special Report.' Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., may be done with Congress. But Congress is not done with him. And as President-elect Trump’s pick to serve as Attorney General, Gaetz is apparently not done with Congress, either. Gaetz negotiated with Mr. Trump to become Attorney General on a flight to Florida – just hours after the incoming President spoke to House Republicans in Washington last week. Mr. Trump then made Gaetz his pick and the Florida Republican resigned. What wasn’t known at the time was that the House Ethics Committee was on the precipice of releasing a report investigating allegations of ""sexual misconduct"" and ""illicit drug use"" by Gaetz. Gaetz stopped cooperating with the House investigation over the summer. The FBI probed Gaetz for years – but dropped its inquiry in February. The Ethics Committee dashed a planned meeting where it likely would have published information about its inquest regarding Gaetz on Friday. But since Gaetz is no longer a Member of Congress, the committee supposedly is powerless to act. THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO POTENTIALLY RELEASING THE ETHICS COMMITTEE REPORT ON GAETZ With Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., named President-elect Trump's unlikely pick for Attorney General, a glaring question looms ahead: what will become of the Ethics Committee's report on alleged improprieties by the congressman? (Mario Tama/Getty Images) House Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest, R-Miss., said the following on Wednesday when asked about the Gaetz probe – but before the Florida Republican resigned. ""Once the investigation is complete, then a report will be issued - assuming that at that time, that Mr. Gaetz is still a Member of Congress. If Mr. Gaetz were to resign because he is taking a position with the administration as the Attorney General then the Ethics Committee loses jurisdiction at that point. Once we lose jurisdiction, there would not be a report that would be issued. That's not unique to this case,"" said Guest. Other Ethics Committee members tried to sidestep discussion of Gaetz. ""I'm not making any comments on that. I'm on the Ethics Committee so I'm staying clear of that,"" said Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla. ""Can you still release the report?"" asked Rachel Scott of ABC. ""Nope. Sure can't,"" replied Rutherford, turning toward Scott. A NARROW MARGIN: TRUMP TAPS HOUSE REPUBLICANS FOR HIS SECOND ADMINISTRATION That is generally how the House Ethics Committee rolls when it comes to outstanding investigations involving former Members. But it is not a hard and fast rule. Fox has found that the Ethics Committee released the information on its probe into potential influence peddling by the late Rep. John Murtha, D-Penn., after his death in 2010. The House Ethics Committee has reportedly released its findings on former Reps. John Murtha, D-Penn., and Bill Boner, D-Tenn., after their departures from office. (Scott J. Ferrell/Congressional Quarterly/Getty Images | CQ Roll Call via Getty Images) The Ethics Committee also released a 699-page report on former Rep. Bill Boner, D-Tenn., after he left office in 1987. The committee found that Boner used campaign funds to travel to Hong Kong and may have used his office to influence a defense contractor. The Ethics Committee investigated former Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., after he was caught sending inappropriate messages to House pages in 2006. Foley abruptly resigned from the House. But the ethics panel hauled in a host of bipartisan Congressional leaders for closed door depositions to determine what they may have known about Foley’s activities. That said, there is a way on the floor to dislodge an Ethics Committee report. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE GAETZ HOUSE ETHICS REPORT? There is a mechanism called ""question of privileges of the House."" A lawmaker could take the floor under this procedure, making the argument that keeping the Gaetz ethics report under wraps impugns the dignity and integrity of the House. The House would be required to vote on such a motion. If successful on the floor, the ethics panel could be compelled to release the report. Yours truly asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., if Democrats might try to dislodge the Gaetz report from the Ethics Committee. Pergram: ""Could you envision a scenario where Democrats try to somehow dislodge this ethics report through a parliamentary maneuver?"" I asked House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., if his party planned on finding a way to dislodge the Gaetz report from the Ethics Committee. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) Jeffries: ""The Ethics Committee is an incredibly bipartisan committee. It's the only committee in the Congress that is evenly divided. And it has a long history of having principled individuals on it. And I defer at this moment to whatever course they decide to take. And I hope they take a course that is bipartisan."" The Senate Judiciary Committee will study the credentials of Gaetz, run background checks and ultimately hold a confirmation hearing before voting the nomination to the floor for a vote. It could also block the nomination as well. Senate Majority Whip and Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., formally asked the House Ethics Committee to send over the report as it reviews the fitness of Gaetz for the job. MATT GAETZ'S NOMINATION ROCKS CAPITOL HILL ""The sequence and timing of Mr. Gaetz’s resignation from the House raises serious questions about the contents of the House Ethics Committee report,"" said Durbin. ""This information could be relevant to the question of Mr. Gaetz’s confirmation as the next Attorney General of the United States and our Constitutional responsibility to advise and consent."" Democrats weren’t the only ones trying to pry loose the report. ""I think there should not be any limitation on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including, whatever the House Ethics Committee generated,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, seems keen to unearth the Gaetz report's findings, saying there should ""not be any limitation"" on what the Senate Judiciary Committee can investigate. (Reuters) Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md., serves on the Ethics Committee. He hinted that the panel should consider dispatching the report to the Senate. ""I think the Senate certainly had a right to request it. I can't talk about our internal deliberations. But the information that they've requested, I think it's totally reasonable,"" said Ivey. ""In fact, I think it's essential for them to get that kind of information before they make a decision."" On Friday, Johnson noted that he ""doesn’t control the Ethics Committee."" THE HITCHHIKER’S GUIDE TO THE MEANING OF A REPUBLICAN SENATE - AND WHAT’S AHEAD FOR THE HOUSE But Johnson went further than he had before about his views on releasing the report. ""We should stick to the tradition of not releasing a report on a former Member of the House because it would open a dangerous Pandora’s box,"" said Johnson. Johnson reaffirmed that during an appearance on Fox News Sunday when asked about releasing the report. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., cautioned against releasing the Ethics Committee's findings, citing precedent and the potential opening of a ""dangerous Pandora's Box."" (Getty Images) ""I think this would be a breach of protocol that could be dangerous for us going forward in the future,"" said the Speaker. It’s possible the Senate Judiciary Committee could subpoena the report from the Ethics Committee. And as suggested earlier, there is a way to dislodge the report from the panel via a vote on the House floor. Such a scenario would put a lot of Republicans in a tough spot. They may fear that voting to release the report could put them on the wrong side of incoming President Trump. That’s to say nothing of the prospective Attorney General. But Gaetz isn’t liked by his former House colleagues. In fact, some Republicans may have more disdain for the former Florida Congressman than Democrats. That’s partly because it was Gaetz who single-handedly triggered a vote last year to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. That maneuver pitched the House into three weeks of chaos. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Gaetz is no longer a Member of the House. But that doesn’t matter. The fight over the ethics report is just getting started. And that’s spurring just as much pandemonium as if Gaetz were still a Member. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

FIRST ON FOX: Republican businessman Eric Hovde is using Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin's previous comments on Trump supporters against her as he looks to unseat her in the critical swing state of Wisconsin.  In a new ad by the Hovde campaign, Baldwin says, ""Donald Trump might be one of the most offensive, hateful and unacceptable presidential candidates we've ever had. So what does that say about the people who support him?"" The remark, which is from a 2016 speech, is cut next to former Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's infamous ""basket of deplorables"" comment, which was credited by some with costing her the election to then-Republican nominee Donald Trump.  SENATE SHAKE-UP: HOW A SECRET BALLOT COULD UNDERMINE A POTENTIAL TRUMP ENDORSEMENT IN RACE TO THE TOP Hovde compared Baldwin's remark to Hillary Clinton calling Trump voters ""deplorables."" (Reuters) The ad will run on television across Wisconsin starting Tuesday and is part of an ongoing multimillion dollar statewide ad campaign.  ""Tammy Baldwin hates Trump and Trump voters, just listen to her own words when it comes to what she thinks about them. Much like Hillary Clinton, the disdain Baldwin has for Wisconsin’s Trump voters will haunt her on Election Day,"" Hovde spokesman Zach Bannon said in a statement.  HOVDE SHINES SPOTLIGHT ON TAMMY BALDWIN'S WALL STREET PARTNER DURING WISCONSIN DEBATE Hovde and Baldwin are facing off for a competitive Wisconsin Senate seat. (Reuters) In response, a Baldwin spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, ""Tammy Baldwin fights for all Wisconsinites no matter who they are, who they vote for or where they live. That stands in stark contrast to her opponent Eric Hovde who has literally called Wisconsinites deplorable, Democrats a ‘curse to society’ and insulted our farmers, seniors, young people, women, Black men, Native American communities and more."" The Democrat senator's campaign also pointed to an interview on ""The Jerry Bader Show"" in 2016, in which Hovde used the word ""deplorable"" to describe the level of civic knowledge among average Americans, with many not knowing the year of the country's founding or who the vice president is.

199,Congress,2024,11,Spending bill trouble brews as Sen Mike Lee warns of Christmas 'swampbus',Julia Johnson,"Incoming GOP Conference Chairman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the possibility of recess appointments, Sen. Thune's warning to the ICC and the controversy surrounding the Pennsylvania Senate recount. FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, is warning Americans that Congress might attempt to pass a large omnibus spending bill ahead of the pre-Christmas deadline, which he said would allow the government to continue operating under Democrats' and President Biden's preferred spending levels.  ""Don’t let the swamp steal Christmas!"" he penned in a letter to the American people, obtained by Fox News Digital on Monday. The document featured a rendering of Biden as the Grinch.  THUNE 'ADAMANT' ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORT, DRIVING MAGA AGENDA DESPITE TENSE PAST RELATIONSHIP Lee accused Democrats of trying to sabotage Trump's presidency by keeping spending at Biden's levels. (Reuters) ""Congress may soon deliver a massive Christmas gift to Joe Biden at the expense of the American people in the form of legislation called an omnibus. This is their last chance to do favors for K Street lobbyists, give carve-outs to donors and friends, and generally spend your tax dollars like there’s no tomorrow,"" the letter said.  According to Lee, such a bill would sabotage President-elect Trump's agenda by design.   He predicted several items that might be part of a ""swampbus,"" including a stopgap spending bill that lasts for a year, more funding for Ukraine, an additional suspension of the debt limit, and other bill priorities with looming deadlines.  Lee urged Americans to contact their senators and representatives to demand they not support any omnibus.  TOP GOP SENATORS WARN DOJ TO PRESERVE JACK SMITH DOCS IN TRUMP CASES, CITING 'PAST DESTRUCTION' OF RECORDS ""Instead, Congress should pass a SHORT TERM continuing resolution for a few months, so that Donald Trump and the unified Republican Congress – decisively elected by Americans just two weeks ago – can drain the swamp, reform our government, and Make America Great Again,"" he said.  A continuing resolution (CR) is a stopgap measure that would keep spending steady for a period of time.  Operating in ""regular order,"" Congress would pass several individual bills responsible for spending on various specific functions of government. However, a stopgap bill or a CR would simply extend the current spending levels across the board.  On ""Fox News Sunday,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., shared this perspective, telling host Shannon Bream, ""[W]e'll have a temporary measure, I think, that would go into the first part of next year and allow us the necessary time to get this done,"" if individual appropriations bills are not passed by the Dec. 20 deadline.  ""Chuck Schumer is still the Democrat leader there in the Senate, and he has refused to put a single appropriations bill on the floor,"" he said of the Democratic majority leader. Johnson noted that with majorities in both the House and Senate and control of the White House in 2025, Republicans would be able to craft and pass a more favorable spending bill with a short-term CR.  THUNE SAYS TRUMP'S BORDER PLAN IS 1ST UP IN RIGOROUS PRIORITY LIST FOR NEW CONGRESS: 'REAL WORK BEGINS' Johnson predicted a continuing resolution may be necessary. (Allison Robbert/Pool via AP) Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, ranking member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, said she still hopes to pass individual appropriations bills, but that it ultimately depends on Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and what he wants to do.  ""But I think it's a big mistake to have the appropriations process – for this fiscal year – go into next fiscal year and risk triggering the caps, which would result in a substantial decrease – more than a 5% decrease in defense spending,"" she added.  As of Wednesday, Collins said she hadn't seen Schumer after recess, let alone discussed appropriations with him.  Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., noted that passing the spending bills individually would be his preference, but when it comes to an omnibus or a continuing resolution stopgap bill, he'd rather the former.

201,Congress,2024,11,Senate GOP initiates Thune-engineered slow down as Schumer looks to stack judicial votes,Julia Johnson," Axios reporter Hans Nichols reacts to the heated Casey-McCormick race as a recount begins on 'Your World.' Senate Republicans opted to delay votes and draw out floor action on Monday night after Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., sought to stack additional judicial confirmation votes on the calendar ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.  Two sources familiar told Fox News Digital that the plan to slow down the Senate was spearheaded by Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who was recently elected as the next Republican Senate leader.  ""If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,"" Thune told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement.  In response to the Democrat leader's decision to file cloture on a number of judicial nominees, which would come up for confirmation votes in a number of days, Republicans plotted procedural maneuvers on the Senate floor to significantly delay votes, multiple GOP sources told Fox News.  GOP CRIES FOUL ON DEM BORDER SPENDING BILL THEY SAY WOULD DRAG OUT MIGRANT CRISIS Republicans sought to delay Democrats' cloture filings on Monday as they attempt to quickly confirm Biden judges. (Reuters) The additional cloture filings by Schumer come as Democrats are focusing their efforts on confirming as many judges nominated by President Biden as they can in the time they have left in the majority.

This is typically done by unanimous consent from the Senate. But on Monday evening, Republicans began objecting to the requests for unanimous consent.  When a senator objects, it requires the transition between executive and legislative sessions to be voted on.  By objecting to Democrats' unanimous consent requests in order to file cloture on the Biden nominees, Republicans are adding additional votes to the schedule, taking up a substantial amount of time.

""The judges we’ve confirmed represent perhaps the widest range of backgrounds and experiences ever seen under any president.

202,Congress,2024,11,Schumer now pleads for bi-partisanship having promised to railroad Democrat agenda through,Michael Dorgan,"Democrats want to turn the Senate into the House. With Republicans sweeping to a red trifecta in last week’s elections, stunningly capturing the White House and majorities in the House and Senate, Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is cutting a different tone, compared to his pre-election hype where he posited a Democrat win in the Senate and then potentially getting rid of the filibuster, among other radical proposals.  Ending the filibuster rule – which requires 60 votes to pass bills – would have made it easier for Democrats to supercharge their agenda and essentially railroad any Republican opposition.  Schumer and the Democrats tried to kill the filibuster in 2022 when they had 50 votes – the vice president could have broken the tie – but Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema refused to toe the Democratic party line. They eventually became Independents. FILIBUSTER: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE POLITICAL DELAY TACTIC Sen. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer talks after a policy luncheon on Capitol Hill, Sept. 24, 2024. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) With Manchin and Sinema leaving the Senate, Schumer was confident of having at least 50 Senate seats after this year’s election with a then-potential Vice President Walz breaking the tie on a filibuster vote.  ""We got it up to 48, but, of course, Sinema and Manchin voted no; that’s why we couldn’t change the rules. Well, they’re both gone,"" Schumer told reporters on the Tuesday during the week of the Democratic convention, according to NBC News. ""Ruben Gallego is for it, and we have 51. So, even losing Manchin, we still have 50."" The result would have essentially meant one-party rule in the Senate, with Schumer also toying with expanding voting rights nationwide by passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.  He also discussed a potential rule change to codify abortion rights in federal law, a party priority after Roe v. Wade was overturned, which would have faced staunch Republican opposition and lacking a path to 60 Senate votes. Schumer also posited reforming the Supreme Court by slapping 18-year term limits on justices and touted reversing the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling, which determined that presidents are immune from prosecution for some ""official acts."" He has previously announced his intention to move legislation that would expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 members. But this week, he went to the floor of the Senate to tell Republicans to essentially go easy on their legislative colleagues on the other side of the aisle, since Republicans will have a 53-to-47 majority.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) ""To my Republican colleagues, I offer a word of caution in good faith,"" Schumer said.  ""Take care not to misread the will of the people, and do not abandon the need for bipartisanship. After winning an election, the temptation may be to go to the extreme. We’ve seen that happen over the decades, and it has consistently backfired on the party in power."" ""So, instead of going to the extremes, I remind my colleagues that this body is most effective when it’s bipartisan. If we want the next four years in the Senate to be as productive as the last four, the only way that will happen is through bipartisan cooperation."" Schumer’s about face wasn’t lost on Byron York, chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner and a Fox News contributor.  Schumer previously announced his intention to move legislation that would expand the Supreme Court from nine to 13 members. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) ""The short version of that is: Please don’t do to us what we were going to do to you,"" York writes in the Washington Examiner.  ""Schumer is obviously concerned that Republicans might embrace a scheme to eliminate the filibuster and pass all sorts of consequential legislation with no Democratic input at all. That wouldn’t be bipartisan!"" ""Fortunately for Schumer, Republicans have been more principled than Democrats when it comes to the legislative filibuster, and to the filibuster in general. Republicans realize that even though they will have the majority for the next two years, they might be back in the minority at any time after that. So Schumer will not get it good and hard the way he planned to give it to Republicans."" York writes that Schumer’s ""brand of hypocrisy is particularly egregious"" since he was advocating changing Senate rules on a partisan basis to eliminate the minority party’s ability to demand a higher standard of approval for controversial legislation, as opposed to advocating to get a particular bill across the line.  ""He was. And then, when Schumer’s party loses, he instantly turns around and becomes Mr. Bipartisanship. For that, there should be a word that goes beyond mere hypocrisy."" Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., will replace Schumer as Majority Leader and is planning to make ushering in President-elect Trump's immigration agenda the first item on his to-do list when he succeeds. He has not indicated that he intended to vote on the filibuster rule. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He said repairing the economy is also near the top of his list. As crucial elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 passed by Trump are set to expire in 2025, Thune said Republicans will take action through the budget reconciliation process to renew them. The trifecta will make Trump's agenda easier to pursue without opposition from a Democratic majority. Republicans held a governing trifecta from 2017 to 2019. The GOP achieved much of their agenda, including sweeping tax reform and confirming justices to achieve a conservative majority in the Supreme Court. But Thune said he would protect the filibuster rule, even if it stands in the way of the Trump agenda it hopes to advance.

The Library of Congress email systems suffered a substantial hack earlier this year by a ""foreign adversary,"" Fox News can confirm. It is unclear if the hack compromised accounts of those who work directly for the House and Senate. However, Fox News is told that U.S. Capitol Police has referred the matter to the FBI, and it is investigating the scope of the hack.

""It is important to note that the House and Senate networks, including individual House and Senate email accounts, were not compromised in any way.

FIRST ON FOX: Lawmakers on Capitol Hill have introduced new legislation to address a shocking rate of inmate sex crimes against federal corrections officers. The Prison Staff Safety Enhancement Act is a response to a Justice Department Inspector General report that found 40% of Federal Bureau of Prisons staffers said they had been sexually attacked by an inmate. ""It is unacceptable that nearly half of Bureau of Prisons staff experience sexual harassment or assault by inmates. The Bureau of Prisons must do more to ensure the safety of corrections officers and to hold perpetrators accountable,"" said Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., who co-sponsored a new bill to fight it.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., and introduced previously. Johnson said the incidents have climbed to ""unacceptable levels,"" especially against female officers.  The bill gives the Justice Department's Inspector General a year to conduct a statistical review of sexual assault and harassment cases inflicted on prison guards by inmates in federal prisons, an analysis of the punishments doled out, and then another 180 days to turn over a report to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.

""We must return to pro-growth, America-first policies to restore prosperity, liberty, and security for the American people."" During the 118th Congress, the House Oversight Committee held 135 hearings, sent more than 600 investigative letters, issued 51 subpoenas, heard testimony from 112 government witnesses and saw 23 bills passed in the House — with three signed into law.  The committee investigated the Biden family’s business dealings, finding that from 2014 to the present, Biden family members and their associates received more than $27 million from foreign individuals or entities. The committee claimed that the family set up shell companies to conceal the payments from scrutiny.  The White House previously ripped the investigation as an ""evidence-free, politically-motivated"" probe.  House Oversight and Accountability Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., speaks during a news conference. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Comer also co-led the impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Comer’s Oversight Committee led the inquiry after its monthslong investigation into the Biden family’s business dealings, alongside the House Judiciary Committee and House Ways & Means Committee.

That bill also required presidents and vice presidents to make disclosures for immediate family members who receive foreign payments and other gifts, or who use official travel for personal business.  HOUSE OVERSIGHT INVESTIGATING WALZ OVER 'LONGSTANDING CONNECTIONS' TO CHINA Regarding its oversight of the Biden-Harris administration’s border crisis, Comer said the committee found there have been more than 8 million illegal immigrants encountered entering the country and over 1.9 million gotaways — illegal immigrants who avoided agents but were detected by other forms of surveillance — since they took office.  As for China, Comer sent letters to 25 federal agencies to investigate whether officials were aware of CCP outreach to the American public. The committee held briefings with 23 federal agencies revealing ""there is no cohesive, government-wide strategy to identify, deter, and defeat CCP political warfare.""

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A bipartisan group of lawmakers passed legislation in the House to bolster geothermal energy production by increasing the frequency of lease sales. The Committing Leases for Energy Access Now Act (CLEAN) passed in the House Tuesday and will amend the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 to require the Department of Interior (DOI) to hold lease sales every year, rather than every two years. Additionally, the bill seeks to speed up the permit process for lease sales by setting a 30-day deadline for the DOI to notify an applicant if a permit has been approved.  The bill also requires the DOI hold a replacement sale if a lease sale is canceled or missed.

(Bill Clark) ""Geothermal energy has tremendous potential to provide reliable, clean energy for millions of Americans,"" Rep. Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, who introduced the bill, said in a statement.  ""As nearly 90% of our nation's geothermal resources are located on federally managed lands, I introduced the CLEAN Act to unleash these critical resources by cutting red tape and increasing lease opportunities on federal lands. This legislation will hold the Department of Interior accountable and is key to bolstering domestic energy production, reducing our reliance on foreign adversaries and meeting America’s growing energy demands.""

""I was very pleased to see the passage of the CLEAN Act out of the U.S. House earlier today to help unlock the full potential of geothermal and boost energy production on federal lands across the west.

213,Congress,2024,11,"Trump would need congressional approval to dissolve Education Department, experts say",Aubrie Spady,"Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos discusses what a second Trump term may mean for U.S. education on 'The Story with Martha MacCallum.' President-elect Trump wants to abolish the Department of Education (DOE), but experts suggest the incoming commander in chief would need congressional approval before doing so. ""One thing I’ll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington, D.C., and sending all education and education work it needs back to the states,"" Trump said on the campaign trail. As Trump solidifies his agenda for a second term, attorneys explained the legal process he would have to go through before proceeding with plans to dissolve the federal department. Andrew Stoltmann, an attorney and law professor, told Fox News Digital Trump would need approval from a supermajority in Congress to do away with the DOE. BETSY DEVOS JOINS TRUMP'S CALL TO ‘DISBAND’ THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND ‘RE-EMPOWER’ FAMILIES President-elect Trump said he would get rid of the Department of Education if elected. (Chip Somodevilla) ""President Trump does not have the ability to eliminate a federal department. Eliminating it would require congressional action, including a supermajority of 60 votes in the Senate,"" Stoltmann said. ""So, even if Trump can follow through with what he says, he has to pull in some Democrats in the Senate, and that will likely be impossible."" TRUMP PLANS TO SHIFT SCHOOL FUNDING CONTROL TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES, HAS YET TO PICK DOE SECRETARY Stoltmann suggested the most realistic scenario is if Trump appoints someone aligned with his agenda to head the department. ""He would need 60 votes in the Senate, and the realistic chances of that are virtually zero,"" he told Fox. ""Trump‘s best bet is to appoint somebody who will effectively be a figurehead at the Department of Education. This doesn’t eliminate the department, but it effectively neuters it during his term."" The US Department of Education building in Washington, D.C.  (Tierney L. Cross) Jamie E. Wright, a political pundit and founder of the Wright Law Firm, told Fox that to dissolve the department, Congress would need to pass new legislation that addresses the laws establishing and sanctioning the department. ""To pass such a bill successfully into law would require backing from members of Congress for the president's agenda to advance smoothly through the legislative process — an endeavor that may present obstacles should opposition arise from legislators who consider the Department of Education crucial in ensuring consistent national educational guidelines and federal funding allocation for education initiatives,"" Wright told Fox.  ""Removing an agency could pose a challenge due to the need for widespread political backing, unity in Congress and broad public approval.""  Republicans have called to dismantle the agency for decades since former President Carter established the department in 1979. Former President Reagan supported getting rid of the Department of Education.  (Getty Images) Former President Reagan championed abolishing the education department and that decisions regarding schools be determined at the local level. Rep. Barry Moore, R-Ala., introduced legislation in 2023 to ""abolish the Department of Education and to provide funding directly to states for elementary and secondary education,"" but the bill did not pass.

214,Congress,2024,11,Dozens of state financial officials warn new Congress of national security implications of ignoring US debt,Charles Creitz,"USAFacts founder and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer discusses his outlook for the U.S. economy during an appearance on ‘Cavuto: Live.’ EXCLUSIVE: More than three dozen state financial officers will send a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson calling for action to assuage their ""grave concerns"" about the national debt. The consortium of treasurers, controllers and auditors will tell Johnson, R-La., they agree with Arizona Republican Andy Biggs’ resolution declaring the national debt a ""threat to national security."" ""We have grave concerns about the national debt. We concur with [legislation from Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., and Biggs, R-Ariz.]…"" ""It gives us great pause that we are speaking of our nation, which serves as the beacon of freedom and opportunity for the world,"" they wrote. BIDEN'S $8T BUDGET MAKES CLAIMS OF CUTTING DEBT LAUGHABLE, ANALYST SAYS ""Control [the] debt to protect the states and American global leadership,"" read the subject line, as the state officials went on to call for the passage of a long-term congressional plan to restore U.S. solvency. The national debt – which measures what the U.S. owes its creditors – rose to $35,965,533,024,604.05 as of Nov. 14, according to the Treasury Department. That is up about $15.2 billion from the figure reported the previous day. The nation’s first Treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, wrote in 1790 that the U.S. debt ""was the price of liberty [and] the faith of America has been repeatedly pledged for it."" ""To justify and preserve their confidence and promote the increasing respectability of the American name… these are great and invaluable ends to be secured by a proper and adequate provision… for the support of public credit."" The U.S. budget was last balanced in the years between 1998 and 2001 during the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. Prior to that, former President Lyndon Johnson oversaw a balanced budget in 1968. ""Balancing the budget and reducing spending are among the most difficult, yet essential, actions you could take,"" the state financial officers wrote to Johnson: ""That is why we have come together to support you in making these critical decisions."" GOP REP JABS EDUCATION SEC ‘ARE CAR LOANS NEXT’ AFTER COLLEGE DEBT FORGIVENESS The National Debt Clock (Reuters) They warned that the cost of servicing the debt in 2024 exceeded both $1 trillion and thereby the annual cost of Medicare payouts. ""America's financial stability, the dollar will be replaced as the reserve currency, and we will lose our nation's status as the global leader. To prevent this looming day of reckoning, which could easily occur within our and our children’s lifetimes, requires a commitment to begin addressing this situation on day one."" The officials expressed that a new president and a new Congress could mean a reset on fiscal policy and potentially produce a ""National Financial Restoration Plan"" before July 4, 2026, when the U.S. turns 250 years old. One avenue they suggested, which has been floated by President-elect Trump as well, is to slash regulations and tap into ""vast national resources"" and put them on the market. Alaska’s chief financial officer, Adam Crum, was one of the signatories of the letter, and the man who appointed him – Gov. Mike Dunleavy – previously told Fox News Digital the state remains ready to work with any administration willing to utilize the Last Frontier’s oil and gas resources in that way. Biden, he said, ""is searching for oil anywhere except at home."" Other signatories have recently made news with their own belt-tightening endeavors, including Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity – who recently announced a $737 million had been added to the state’s ""Rainy Day Fund.""  Garrity said when she took office in 2021 that it was one of the ""worst reserve funds"" of any state, and praised both the Republican legislature and Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro for their aid.

215,Congress,2024,10,Pacific Northwest could decide which party controls the House,Jason Rantz,"Fox News contributor David Webb joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his take on VP Kamala Harris' town hall conversation with Charlamagne tha God as she struggles to gain ground with Black male voters.  Washington and Oregon voters find themselves in an unusual position in the deeply blue states: they could play a pivotal role in determining Republican control of the House, placing these traditionally predictable states under the spotlight.   As usual, voter turnout will be the deciding factor. But it’s low Democratic enthusiasm, partially driven by the unpopularity of Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, and backlash against Democratic support of Israel could potentially swing two seats to Republicans and help the party hold onto a third in these competitive districts.

John Fetterman, D-Pa., says he will not ‘politicize’ the Israel-Hamas during an appearance on ‘Fox News Sunday.’  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., accused Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., of a ""bleak dunk attempt"" after he highlighted a headline about her calling out the Biden administration regarding Israel. ""The tragedy in Gaza is 100% on Hamas. Stop using civilians and hospitals as shields, surrender, and release all remaining hostages—and this ends,"" Fetterman tweeted when sharing the Ocasio-Cortez-related headline.

Hope this bleak dunk attempt gets you whatever it is you’re going for,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in response to Fetterman's post. Earlier this week, the congresswoman had tweeted, ""The horrors unfolding in northern Gaza are the result of a completely unrestrained Netanyahu gov, fully armed by the Biden admin while food aid is blocked and patients are bombed in hospitals.

I will continue to be a voice for our ally, for the release of all remaining hostages, and for peace to return.""

217,Congress,2024,11,Mace faces backlash over effort to ban new transgender member of Congress from women's bathrooms,Chris Pandolfo,"MSNBC host Jen Psaki argued that the issue of transgender athletes in sports has been blown out of proportion and should be ignored by Democrats. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., clashed with her critics online Tuesday as she faces backlash for her resolution to bar men who identify as female from the women's restrooms on Capitol Hill. Mace filed the resolution on Monday, which Fox News Digital's Elizabeth Elkind first reported will prohibit ""Members, officers, and employees of the House from using single-sex facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.""  The resolution comes just as the first openly transgender lawmaker, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, D-Del., is set to join Congress in January. McBride is a biological male who identifies and presents as a woman.  ""This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing,"" McBride said in a statement. ""We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.""

When online critics said Mace's resolution was ""clearly directed"" at McBride, the South Carolina congresswoman confirmed that was her intention. ""Yes and then some. Biological men do not have any rights to women’s private spaces. It’s perverted to think otherwise,"" Mace posted on X in response to another user.  ""Also Sarah McBride doesn't get a say here.

Left-wing journalist Aaron Rupar shared a screenshot of Mace's response and wrote, ""Note how ‘concerns about fairness in sports’ has already transformed into unvarnished transphobic bigotry.""  Mace responded, ""Protecting women and girls isn’t bigotry, it’s common sense. I will stand in the brink to protect women’s rights from the far left radicals trying to erase us.""  Harry Sisson, a Democratic content creator on TikTok, likewise accused Mace of ""straight up bigotry and bullying.""  Mace quoted his X post and wrote, ""All these radical left men pushing other men into women’s private spaces shows you how sick they truly are – the Left will do whatever they can to harm women and girls.

To which Mace quoted his reply and wrote, ""I don’t want people with penis’s [sic] showing them off in our locker room.""  In a follow-up post, Phillips asked, ""Why wouldn’t we ‘allow’ our fellow citizens the right to use the damn toilet of the gender by which they live their lives?  ""You may not like it. I get it. But it’s still common sense and banning it seems un-American,"" he continued. ""So come-on patriots, let’s be cool with one another.""  But Mace refused to back down.  Rep. Nancy Mace narrowly won election in 2020 over incumbent Joe Cunningham (D) by one-percent or about 5,400 votes. With newly redrawn redistricting maps in place, she comfortably won reelection by 14%. (Getty Images) ""As a victim of abuse, I know firsthand women are vulnerable; and I will stand in the way of anyone who violates our rights or who wants to set us back 100 years,"" she wrote. Semafor politics reporter David Weigel observed that Mace's position is a ""shift"" to the right after she supported a Republican alternative to the Democrat-backed Equality Act, which would have added sexual orientation and gender identity language to federal anti-discrimination law.

I’m also a constitutionalist, and we have to ensure anti-discrimination laws don’t violate First Amendment rights or religious freedom,"" Mace said at the time. ""I have friends and family that identify as LGBTQ,"" she added. ""Understanding how they feel and how they’ve been treated is important.

218,Congress,2024,11,Blue state CEO who put up 100-foot pro-Trump sign to spend $2.6 million on campaign for Congress,Chris Pandolfo,"Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino has filed to run for Congress to succeed outing Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who was appointed to be the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. FIRST ON FOX: Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino has officially tossed his hat in the ring to fill the vacancy left by New York Rep. Elise Stefanik's appointment to serve in the Trump administration. The pro-Trump businessman, who installed a 100-foot ""Vote for Trump"" sign in upstate New York before the election, tells Fox News Digital he will spend $2.6 million to self-fund his bid to succeed Stefanik once she becomes the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in January. ""My phones are ringing off the hook with people encouraging me to run, who wanted me to run,"" Constantino, 40, said in an interview. ""And just like President Trump was an outsider who brought a great skill set to politics, a great skill set to government, I think the country needs more people with similar backgrounds that are outsiders, that are talented people. And I happen to be one of them.""  Stefanik currently represents New York's 21st Congressional District, which encompasses the solidly Republican North Country, a large swath of upstate New York that includes most of the Adirondack Mountains and Thousand Islands region. She is expected to resign from Congress after President-elect Trump tapped her to represent the United States at the U.N. PRO-TRUMP TECH CEO MULLING CONGRESSIONAL RUN TO FILL STEFANIK'S SEAT IDENTIFIES NEW YORK'S ‘BIGGEST PROBLEM’ Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino speaks at an event in New York. (Paul Antonelli) ""I am honored to nominate Chairwoman Elise Stefanik to serve in my Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. Elise is an incredibly strong, tough, and smart America First fighter,"" Trump said.  Stefanik gladly accepted the nomination, stating, ""I am truly honored to earn President Trump's nomination to serve in his Cabinet as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. During my conversation with President Trump, I shared how deeply humbled I am to accept his nomination and that I look forward to earning the support of my colleagues in the United States Senate. President Trump’s historic landslide election has given hope to the American people and is a reminder that brighter days are ahead — both at home and abroad.""  Her appointment sets the stage for a special election to fill her seat in the 21st District following her successful re-election bid last week. Stefanik secured victory by more than 24% of the vote against her opponent, Paula Collins.  Constantino filed paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission on Thursday to set up his campaign committee. Formerly a registered Democrat, he is now one of several Republicans expected to contend for the GOP nomination, a group that could include established state lawmakers, local officials and other experienced politicians. What makes him stand out, in his view, is that he had no intention of entering politics until about three months ago.  TECH CEO WHO WENT VIRAL FOR PRO-TRUMP EMAIL DEFENDS CALL TO ACTION OVER ‘POLITICAL HATE’ The illuminated ""Vote for Trump"" sign at 26 Elk Street, Amsterdam, New York. (@stickermule | Instagram) ""The best thing about my situation is, until recently, I had no political ambitions, which I think makes me a better candidate,"" he said. ""I just got involved because a bullet hit President Trump, and immediately I spoke up, and I sent out a message to 5 million customers that was a massively viral message."" A would-be assassin's bullet struck Trump in the right ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. The gunfire injured two others in the crowd and killed a third, volunteer firefighter Corey Comperatore.  Constantino says he was inspired by that horrific act of violence to take a stand against ""anti-Trump hate"" and seek to unify the country. He worked ""around the clock"" to support Trump's White House campaign, formed a political action committee and defeated local Democratic officials who had sued to remove his $125,000 pro-Trump sign on the repurposed Fownes glove factory building in Amsterdam. ""President Trump has really done great things. He's a great human. He's done great things for the world. And he doesn't deserve all the hate directed at him, and his supporters don't deserve it either,"" Constantino previously told Fox News Digital.  BLUE STATE CEO SUED OVER PRO-TRUMP SIGN NETS ‘EPIC WIN FOR FREE SPEECH’ Sticker Mule CEO Anthony Constantino speaks at an event unveiling his 100-foot ""Vote for Trump"" sign in Amsterdam, New York. (Paul Antonelli) Now that Trump has won in a historic victory, Constantino believes the anti-Trump fervor that consumed half of the country before the election is dying down. And with a desire to ""do big things"" and make an impact, he is eyeing a seat in Congress.  ""I like to be impactful. I like to do big things. And right now, this is probably the biggest, most impactful thing I can do with my life,"" he said.  If elected, Constantino said his priorities would be to support businesses and help make New York a happier place to live. ""The biggest problem in New York is people are leaving, and we've got to bring energy and enthusiasm back to New York. And we've got to show America that New York is safe for people from all parties, Democrats and Republicans alike,"" he said.  There will not be a traditional Republican primary for the special election. Instead, both the GOP and Democratic nominees will be chosen by party chairs in the district. It's a process that could advantage political insiders – other candidates floated for the position include ousted Rep. Marc Molinaro, Rensselaer County Executive Steve McLaughlin, state Sens. Dan Stec and Jake Ashby and Assembly Members Chris Tague and Robert Smullen, according to City & State New York.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Constantino enters the fray as a wealthy self-made man and favorite of the online MAGA movement thanks to his viral pro-Trump sign. The $2.6 million he will inject into his campaign is the exact value of gains from his stock in Tesla, which he invested in after Trump-supporting billionaire Elon Musk purchased Twitter in 2022.  ""I made a bet on @Tesla when Elon Musk bought Twitter and everyone went nuts dumping the stock. It made me $2.6 million that I will use to fully fund my campaign for the NY-21 Congressional seat,"" he posted Sunday on X. ""Thank you @elonmusk!"" Constantino plans to meet with the GOP chairs in his district to discuss how he can fund his candidacy without relying on party resources. He also hopes to earn Stefanik's support as she is likely to play kingmaker when it comes to her successor.  ""I'm going to be funding my own campaign. I don't want to be a drain on the party,"" Constantino told Fox News Digital. ""I want people to know that I won't be beholden to any special interests. I'm doing this for the right reasons. I will always do what I think is right, what I think is ethically right, morally right and what's best for people.""  Fox News Digital's Bailee Hill contributed to this report.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., grills DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the release of Laken Riley's alleged killer into the U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., claims that Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and FBI Director Christopher Wray skipped a public Senate hearing to avoid criticism over the verdict in the case of Laken Riley's murder. Mayorkas and Wray were scheduled to testify before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Thursday, but the hearing was postponed after they insisted it be classified and not open to the public. Hawley told Fox News Digital in a Thursday interview that he is calling on Committee Chairman Gary Peters, D-Mich., to subpoena the pair's public testimony. ""Let's not forget who let him into country,"" Hawley said of Riley's murderer, Jose Ibarra. ""Mayorkas lied about how he got into country. He said authorities didn't have information about his past crimes. False. Then he claimed he didn't remember the details. False. Now he's refusing to comment."" Fox News Digital reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment on Hawley's remarks, but they did not immediately respond.

The House Homeland Security Committee punted its hearing, originally scheduled for Wednesday, to December. A source with the committee told Fox News Digital that the hearing will be classified. LAKEN RILEY MURDER TRIAL: PROSECUTORS PLACE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT SUSPECT AT SCENE IN OPENING STATEMENTS Hawley indicated that the Senate would not comply so easily, however.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is facing heavy criticism for refusing to appear in a public Senate hearing.

230,General Politics,2024,11,Heritage launching $1M campaign targeting senators who could 'make or break' Trump Cabinet confirmations,Brooke Singman,"'America Reports' panelists Mark Penn and Ari Fleischer react to several of President-elect Trump’s Cabinet picks. FIRST ON FOX: The Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action for America are launching a $1 million public education campaign to advocate for the ""prompt confirmation"" of President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet appointees and will target the home states of key senators who could ""make or break"" the confirmation process, Fox News Digital has learned.  The campaign will also educate the American public on presidential authority on Cabinet appointments.  TRUMP TEAM 'CONFIDENT' SENATE REPUBLICANS WILL APPROVE CABINET SELECTIONS ""Taking down the deep state isn’t just a priority for President Trump — it’s the mandate the American people gave him,"" president of the Heritage Foundation and Heritage Action for America Dr. Kevin Roberts told Fox News Digital. ""If he succeeds, it will cement his legacy as the president who confronted Washington’s unaccountable bureaucracy and restored power to the people.""  Roberts said Trump’s Cabinet choices ""reflect a commitment to this mission, and now is the time for every conservative to quickly unite behind his nominees and get to work saving this great republic.""  Heritage officials, like Executive Vice President Ryan Walker, said the organization and its ""millions of grassroots conservatives stand ready to support President Trump and his slate of nominees through a swift Senate confirmation process.""  President-elect Donald Trump speaks during an America First Policy Institute gala at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024 in Palm Beach, Florida. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Walker told Fox News Digital that it is imperative for the new Senate GOP majority to ""unite to deliver on the promises made to the American people to implement the America First agenda as soon as possible.""  Walker said the organization plans to use ""all advocacy tools"" at their disposal to ensure Trump's Cabinet nominees receive ""timely advice-and-consent consideration in the Senate as envisioned by the founders."" Meanwhile, the former general counsel to the U.S. Department of Transportation under Trump, now a distinguished fellow at the Heritage Foundation, Steve Bradbury, told Fox News Digital that Trump ""is right to demand a return to the regular constitutional order for appointments in which the Senate gives his nominees expedited consideration and a prompt confirmation vote.""  TRUMP PICKING CABINET AT BREAKNECK SPEED COMPARED TO 2016 ""The advice and consent function of the Senate is critical to our constitutional system of separated powers, but it should not be used to obstruct the president’s ability to put qualified appointees in place,"" Bradbury said. ""The president is also right to demand an end to the Senate’s dubious practice of using pro forma sessions to prevent recess appointments.""  Bradbury noted that until recent history, presidents have exercised their authority under the Constitution to fill vacancies during recesses of the Senate with temporary appointments.

(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) ""This power is an important check on the Senate’s advice and consent function, and President Trump is right to reserve his authority to make use of his recess appointment power if the Senate refuses to give his nominees fair and prompt consideration,"" he said.  Trump has already tapped the majority of key Cabinet officials and is ""confident"" that Senate Republicans ""will hold the line and respect the will of the American people by approving his cabinet nominees.""  A Trump transition official told Fox News Digital that the president-elect is ""very happy"" with Vice President-elect JD Vance, who has been ""laser focused on already getting the ball rolling on his highly-qualified nominees.""  LOYALTY MATTERS: TRUMP PICKS ALLIES AND SUPPORTERS TO FILL OUT HIS ADMINISTRATION Trump's nominees and administration picks during his second administration are being publicly announced at a much faster pace than during his first administration in 2016, which the transition team attributed to Trump's commitment to putting ""America first.""

""Morning Joe"" co-host Mika Brzezinski said during a podcast on Wednesday that she was surprised by the backlash she and co-host Joe Scarborough were getting for meeting with President-elect Trump, attributing the furor to people being ""scared."" ""I’ve been surprised at the backlash, and the way I look at it is, people are really scared,"" she said on ""The Daily Beast Podcast."" ""It’s one of the reasons we went in there, is people are really scared about Donald Trump’s comments about political adversaries, a lot of people are scared because of what has happened with abortion. These are all issues that are important to me and in some ways personal to me, but definitely personal to the people I really care about."" Brzezinski joined the program hosted by Samantha Bee and Joanna Coles on Wednesday to discuss the aftermath of her and Scarborough's meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, which the married couple announced on their show on Monday. ""I hope that we have more conversations. I hope we do an interview,"" Brzezinski said during a podcast. ""So I want to, you know, stick to the guidelines that we put in place, me, myself, for the interview. I talked to a reporter last night. She was very, very upset that I did this meeting.

The MSNBC host noted that the meeting with Trump was on background, and said she's done her best to be as transparent as possible in light of that fact.  Some reports have stated Scarborough and Brzezinski were motivated to meet by fear of retribution by Trump against them due to their fierce criticisms of him over the years, including repeated accusations of Trump being a fascist and authoritarian threat. The show's ratings have suffered in the days since the announcement.  The meeting drew mockery from pundits across the aisle, with the left saying it was essentially a betrayal of their viewers and effective capitulation to Trump, and the right saying the hosts were admitting their past rhetoric about Trump was hyperbolic if they were willing to talk to him. Others defended the meeting as a legitimate journalistic exercise. Asked about how she dealt with Trump's criticisms of the pair as co-hosts, Brzezinski explained she was looking at how to do things differently.

Some House Republicans are embracing the idea of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., leading a new congressional subcommittee dedicated to cutting down on government waste. House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., is planning to commission a new panel under his purview called the Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) subcommittee, Fox News Digital first learned on Thursday. And multiple Republican lawmakers have already told Fox News Digital they hope to join the panel. ""Marjorie would take no prisoners,"" said Rep.

""I think she'll be a basically an immovable object on some of the spending cuts that we need,"" Luna said. As to her own bid for a spot, she said, ""We're going to make a push right now.""

Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., who serves on Comer's Oversight Committee, did not feel strongly one way or another about joining the DOGE subcommittee but praised Greene's ascension to the chair. ""One thing about Marjorie is that she's, you know, she's locked in on details, and so she's going to want to be very helpful to Elon and Vivek,"" Donalds said. ""And obviously, we're breaking new ground here."" He also suggested that Rep. Michael Cloud, R-Texas, would be ""very good"" on the subcommittee.

233,General Politics,2024,11,Gaetz withdraws as attorney general nominee,Breanne Deppisch,"‘Outnumbered’ co-hosts react to the breaking news as the Trump team navigates the transition to the White House. Matt Gaetz, the former Florida representative and Trump nominee for Attorney General, announced Thursday that he is withdrawing as Trump's pick for the top prosecutor, citing what he described as the ""distraction"" his nomination had caused due to a swirl of allegations about paying underage women for sex.  ""While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,"" Gaetz said. ""There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump's DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1."" The news comes amid a swirl of allegations surrounding Gaetz, who for months had been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee until his resignation last Wednesday from the current congressional session. LeVell and Democratic Strategist Julie Roginsky had been arguing over whether former lawmaker Matt Gaetz sexual misconduct allegations were true.  (Reuters) The panel had subpoenaed him as recently as September for an ongoing investigation into alleged sexual misconduct with a minor. Gaetz in response told the panel he would ""no longer voluntarily participate"" in their probe. Gaetz’s decision to step down eight days after his nomination now leaves open the role of attorney general—a position for which Trump had been considering a wide-ranging list of candidates, including former DOJ officials, members of Congress, and outside officials. Those on the short list included Former White House attorney Mark Paoletta, who served during Trump’s first term as counsel to then-Vice President Mike Pence and to the Office of Management and Budget; Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, who was tapped in 2022 to be the state’s top prosecutor after then-state Attorney General Eric Schmitt was elected to the U.S. Senate.

Matt Gaetz, Republican from Florida, speaks with former President Donald Trump, 2024 Republican presidential candidate, left, at the Steer N' Stein bar while attending the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa, US, on Saturday, Aug. 12, 2023. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Since taking over the state AG’s office, Bailey has led dozens of lawsuits against the Biden administration and sought to defend the state on a number of conservative issues as well.  The one position all had in common was loyalty—for which Trump praised Gaetz for in his nomination.  Trump confirmed the news in a post on Truth Social Thursday afternoon. ""I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General,"" the president-elect said.""He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect,"" Trump added. ""Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will."" DEPARTMENT LOOKING TO WIND DOWN TRUMP CRIMINAL CASES AHEAD OF INAUGURATION U.S. Rep.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images) In a Truth Social post announcing Gaetz's nomination, Trump said Gaetz ""has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice."" Regardless of who Trump picks, ""He's going to want someone who he knows, likes and trusts,"" former acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker told Fox News about the role earlier this month. ""He's going to want someone who was there from the beginning."" The House Ethics Committee deadlocked Tuesday on whether to release their report on their investigation into the former congressman, which kicked off following a Justice Department investigation in 2021 stemming from allegations related to sex trafficking.  The DOJ did not press charges in the matter, and attorneys for Gaetz said in 2023 that the Justice Department had dropped the investigation.  ""We have just spoken with the DOJ and have been informed that they have concluded their investigation into Congressman Gaetz and allegations related to sex trafficking and obstruction of justice, and they have determined not to bring any charges against him,"" Gaetz attorneys Marc Mukasey and Isabelle Kirshner said in a statement last February reported by multiple news outlets.

Brian Kemp of Georgia, taking over as Republican Governors Association chair, shares his gameplan for the 2025 and 2026 elections in a Fox News Digital exclusive interview. MARCO ISLAND, FL - EXCLUSIVE - Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, the new chair of the Republican Governors Association, says a top mission for GOP governors going forward will be helping President-elect Trump. Kemp highlighted in a Fox News Digital interview that Republican governors spent the past four years ""pushing back"" on President Biden's administration. And speaking to the media for the first time after being elected RGA chair at the group's annual winter meeting - held this year at a waterfront resort in southwest Florida - the popular conservative two-term governor said on Wednesday that ""we need to focus on making sure that we're getting the Trump administration off to a strong start.""

Trump urged, and then supported, a 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary challenge against Kemp by former Sen. David Perdue. But the former president toned down his criticism of the governor after Kemp crushed Perdue to easily win renomination on his way to re-election. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS SAY WITH TRUMP ELECTION, ‘WE’VE GOT A FRIEND IN THE WHITE HOUSE' But Trump, at a rally in Atlanta in August, unexpectedly went on a tirade against the Georgia governor - only to publicly praise Kemp just a few weeks later in a major about-face for the former president. And the two politicians teamed up in October - for the first time in four years - to survey hurricane damage in Georgia. Former President Trump shakes hands with Gov. Brian Kemp after speaking at a temporary relief shelter as he visits areas impacted by Hurricane Helene, Oct. 4, 2024, in Evans, Georgia.

Republicans held onto the 27-23 gubernatorial advantage in this month's elections, thanks in part to the efforts of the RGA. ""We're ready to keep working as we move into what will be a tough cycle for us in Virginia, in New Jersey [the only two states to hold elections for governor in 2025] and then having 36 races in 2026."" Kemp emphasized that ""my goal is for us to continue to raise enough money to be competitive. The Democrats are out spending us because they have big check writers, but we have a lot of really dedicated donors. We'll try to continue to build the tent, make sure that we have good candidates and win because our policies are better."" Republican Gov. Brian Kempis interviewee d by Fox News Digital, on Sept. 27, 2022, in Alpharetta, Georgia, during his re-election campaign. (Fox News ) Kemp said his comfortable re-election in 2022 and Trump's victory in Georgia earlier this month in the presidential election ""gives us a lot of confidence, a lot of hope, but we also know that the '26 midterm is going to be tough.""  Kemp is term-limited and can't seek another term in office in 2026. The contest to succeed him will be a top gubernatorial election in two years. ""I'm gonna be very engaged, you can rest assured, to making sure that my [successors] are Republican. I have a vested interest in doing that,"" Kemp said. ""We'll be working with the Trump administration and a lot of other people to make sure that that's happening not only in Georgia, but in other states around the country, in places like Kansas, where we have a Democratic governor right now, in places like Arizona, where we have a really good shot at winning the governor's races. So we're going to be on offense."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Georgia will also have a high-profile Senate showdown, as Republicans aim to defeat Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff in 2026. Asked if he'll be courted by national Republicans to take on Ossoff, Kemp responded ""well, I may."" But he quickly pivoted, stressing that ""my focus right now, being just elected the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, is on raising money for us to be competitive in 2025 and 2026. I've made the commitment to do that, and I'm gonna fulfill that commitment. We'll see what happens down the road with anything else."" Asked if he's not ruling out a possible 2026 Senate bid or even a 2028 White House run, the governor diplomatically said ""I try to keep all doors open in politics.""

236,General Politics,2024,11,Biden administration loosens immigration restrictions ahead of second Trump term: ‘Last-ditch effort’,Peter Pinedo,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams told ""The View"" on Friday that Americans voted last Tuesday to fix America's ""broken"" immigration system. The Biden administration is loosening some key immigration restrictions ahead of President-elect Trump’s second term, opening the door for thousands more illegal immigrants to enter the country. Trump has indicated that he could declare a national emergency and use military assets to carry out mass deportations. The Biden administration, however, is taking steps to make Trump's plans for the border more difficult. The Biden Department of Homeland Security is launching an ICE Portal app in December that will allow migrants to skip their in-person check-ins at an ICE office and instead check in with immigration officials via an app on a phone or computer, according to reporting by The New York Post. The app reportedly has severe glitching issues and does not track a migrant's location if he or she is using an Android phone or laptop. Further, the app does not check migrants for past arrests or outstanding warrants and allows them to opt out of or contest government orders to undergo electronic tracking.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) The New York Post reported that up to 100,000 migrants will be enrolled in the new program’s first wave. This comes after the Biden administration set the record for the highest number of illegal migrants entering the country in a single year in 2023, with 3.2 million entries. This surpassed the previous record of 2.7 million set the year before. Among the cities most impacted by this surge is New York, which has seen over 223,000 migrants arrive in the city since spring 2022. As a sanctuary city, New York spent $3.7 billion in housing, food and other costs in the 2024 fiscal year alone. Migrants congregate in Tompkins Square Park as volunteers give away food and clothing in the East Village neighborhood of New York City. (Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis via Getty Images) Joe Borelli, a Republican New York City council member, told Fox News Digital that many were hoping that with a second Trump presidency on the horizon, the crisis would ""wind down."" Instead, he said, ""These actions taken during the death gargles of the Biden administration are disheartening, to say the least."" ""This doesn't seem to be in the spirit of the peaceful transition Biden promised,"" he added. ""This is a last-ditch effort to usurp the will of the people who voted decisively against sanctuary city policies and unrestrained illegal immigration.""

Matt Gaetz, the former Florida representative and President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, announced Thursday that he is withdrawing as Trump's pick for the top prosecutor.  Who is in consideration now for the top spot? Here are potential names floated to head the Department of Justice next.  Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey was tapped by Missouri Gov.

FIRST ON FOX: House Republicans are eyeing ways to slash the outpouring of federal dollars after President-elect Donald Trump signaled that cutting government red tape would be a major part of his agenda. Rep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla., introduced a new bill on Thursday, titled the ""Decreasing Overlapping Grants Efficiently (DOGE) Act,"" which would establish a system for cutting down on redundant government grants from across multiple departments. It comes after Trump announced the creation of an advisory panel called the Department of Government Efficiency, which he tapped Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk to lead.

(Getty Images) ""Like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, I'm looking at ways to make the government more efficient and accountable,"" Bice told Fox News Digital. ""The DOGE Act would create a deconfliction and tracking system for federal grants that not only reduces waste but also builds confidence in how public funds are distributed and managed."" In addition to the tracking system the legislation creates, it also prohibits the government from issuing multiple federal grants to the same applicant for the same or similar purpose. MIKE JOHNSON WINS REPUBLICAN SUPPORT TO BE HOUSE SPEAKER AGAIN AFTER TRUMP ENDORSEMENT The bill is being led by House Main Street Caucus Vice Chair Stephanie Bice.

Aaron Bean, R-Fla., who co-founded the DOGE Caucus in the House earlier this week.

241,General Politics,2024,11,RUBY CHEN: Trump NSA pick Mike Waltz can help US crush Hamas,Ruby Chen,"Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., details what he'll focus on as national security adviser since being nominated by President-elect Trump on 'Hannity.' As President-elect Trump continues to shape his cabinet, the selection of Mike Waltz as incoming national security adviser gives me, the father of Itay Chen, a U.S. hostage being held in Gaza by Hamas, a renewed sense of hope. Waltz should bring the decisive policy changes that we, the families of those abducted by Hamas, have been begging for.

My son Itay, along with six other U.S. citizens, has been held hostage since Oct. 7, 2023. Negotiations, pressure, and sanctions have so far failed to free them. Waltz has an opportunity to redefine the U.S. approach and implement a forceful strategy that directly targets the existence and future lifeblood of Hamas. With Waltz’s experience as a Green Beret, and commitment to U.S. security, he can shape a policy that not only helps Israel dismantle these threats, but also corrects America’s policy in the Middle East to enable peace and stability through strength. FOUR AMERICAN HOSTAGES REMAIN IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY A YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 MASSACRE Hagit and her son, Itay Chen (Hagit Chen) Give Israel a Green Light to Pursue Hamas Leadership Globally

Hamas started this war on Oct. 7 with their murders, rapes, torture and abductions of Israelis. Yet, throughout the subsequent fighting, many of those leading the terror group have been living abroad comfortably, avoiding the consequences of the conflagration they began. Now that Qatar has finally expelled Hamas leaders from its borders, Israel has a unique chance to make them pay for their part in the Oct. 7 atrocities. The U.S. should unequivocally support Israel’s efforts to physically dismantle Hamas’s leadership – wherever it may operate.

Intensify Economic Sanctions on Iran and Its Proxies

Iran’s ongoing financial support for Hamas – such as the fake charities set up in Turkey and other countries – helps fuel this conflict, providing incentives for terrorists and the daily operational cash the terror group needs to survive. By intensifying sanctions on Iran and establishing more robust frameworks to crack down on illegal money transfers globally, the U.S. can cut off the resources that enable acts of global terror. This will signal worldwide that supporting terrorism is not good business under President Trump’s watch. Without financial resources, terror cannot thrive. Push Turkey to Pick a Side: NATO or Hamas

Turkey's position as a NATO member comes with assurances, privileges and responsibilities. One of those is a commitment to peace and the rejection of terror. Turkey’s response to the Oct. 7 massacre and its continuous support of Hamas is contrary to NATO’s values. There is a clear axis of evil: On the one side, Russia, North Korea, Iran and its Houthi, Hamas, and Hezbollah proxies, and on the other, the U.S., Israel, the UK, France and other NATO members. The U.S. must let Turkey know that it cannot reap the benefits of being a NATO member while also acting contrary to U.S. strategic interests.

Support Israeli Leadership in Securing Hostage Releases For the families of Hamas hostages, every day is an eternity. I call on Mike Waltz and the entire incoming administration to redouble its efforts, providing every tool possible to secure the release of the hostages: More diplomatic initiatives, enhanced intelligence sharing, U.S. boots on the ground, and more – all aimed at bringing the U.S. hostages home. My family deserves to be whole again, every family deserves to be whole again, and this support is vital to that mission. Now, with President Trump, incoming Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Waltz as national security adviser, we have a unique opportunity for the release of the U.S. hostages to be a catalyst for a new era for the Middle East. I have faith that President Trump and his leadership team can help build a new Middle East based on a 2.0 Abraham Accords with Saudi Arabia and other Arab Sunni countries joining the peace treaty with Israel. On a personal level, my family prays that by Christmas my family will have its holiday miracle and be whole again and reunited with our son. Ruby is the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old Israeli-American who was taken captive by the Hamas terrorist organization on Oct. 7, 2023. Although the Israel Defense Force believes Itay may have been killed, Ruby, who lives in Israel with his wife, Hagit, and their two other children, continues to hold out hope his son is alive.

Israel also made other procedural challenges, but they were rejected.

243,General Politics,2024,11,Hacker obtains House ethics testimony on Matt Gaetz as Trump makes calls for AG nominee,Howard Kurtz,"National Review staff writer Caroline Downey and Oakland Corps adviser Lucy Caldwell joined 'MediaBuzz' to discuss why the former presidential candidate has faced scrutiny from the media and other critics.  David French, the conservative New York Times contributor and longtime anti-Trumper, has a provocative take on why the president-elect won. It’s the economy and the border, stupid. ""I can’t help but think that if the withdrawal from Afghanistan hadn’t been a bloody mess (that’s when President Biden’s approval rating went underwater, and it never came back), if inflation hadn’t spiked and if migration hadn’t surged at the border, then we’d be having a different conversation. ""I know that the Harris campaign had answers for all these criticisms. The American people wanted to end the Afghan war, and Biden was saddled with Trump’s terrible deal with the Taliban. Inflation was a global phenomenon, and it was unfair to entirely blame Biden when, by 2023, America had the lowest inflation rate among the Group of 7 countries. The Biden administration had finally cracked down on the border and had endorsed a tough new border bill.""  WHY TRUMP IS STICKING WITH GAETZ, HEGSETH DESPITE NEW ACCUSATIONS – AND HIS 'MORNING JOE' MEETING FILE - Then-Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Mint Hill, N.C.  (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) He adds that ""they also rightly argued that Trump nostalgia was misplaced. It was wrong to give the former president a pass for the pandemic or for the chaos and murder spikes of 2020. His term did not end in 2019, with peace and prosperity. It ended near the beginning of 2021 with disease, violence and cultural decay. Even the memories of the time before Covid are idealized."" So it was really Joe Biden who lost the election by letting inflation spiral – he was, in fairness, digging out of the pandemic – and turning the border into a free-for-all zone. He was also a terrible salesman for a series of bipartisan victories. When his mental decline became obvious at the debate, and he stepped aside for Kamala Harris, she had to run on that record – and famously told ""The View"" that she couldn’t think of a single thing where she differed with the president. So the powerless Democrats may be more screwed than you think. THE PODCAST CAMPAIGN: IS IT CURTAINS FOR MAINSTREAM MEDIA? Given the party’s evolution from champion of the working class to representing the highly educated coastal elites in politics, academia and journalism, the Dems are left without a winning coalition they once took for granted. In a Times news story, Jennifer Medina writes: ""The working-class voters Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign needed were not moved by talk of joy. They were too angry about feeling broke. Vice President Kamala Harris thanks and speaks with supporters after conceding to former President Donald Trump at The Yard at Howard University in Washington, DC on November 6, 2024.   (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images) ""The losses up and down the ballot leave Democrats in crisis. Voters without a college degree make up a solid majority of the electorate. Without them, the White House could be out of reach. And for a party that stands for and takes pride in its diversity, the erosion of support from voters of color calls its identity into question."" What’s more, in interviewing hundreds of working-class minority voters, Medina found that ""for many, hope had already hardened into cynicism. Promises about affordable housing fell flat and promoting accomplishments on insulin prices failed to break through. Simply put, their trust in the Democratic Party was gone."" MEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS Now that brings us to Donald Trump’s self-proclaimed mandate, even if CNN was happy to report that Trump’s vote share had dropped slightly below 50% (Who cares? He’s the 47th president.) Now comes news, first reported by ABC, that an unidentified hacker has obtained the sworn testimony of Matt Gaetz accusers from the House ethics probe and apparently plans to make it public. The hacker accessed the file through a law firm involved in a civil suit against Joel Greenberg, a former Gaetz pal now serving an 11-year prison term for sex trafficking. The file includes testimony under oath by a woman who says she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17, back in 2017, and from another woman saying she witnessed the sexual encounter. Matt Gaetz speaks at the Republican Party of Florida Freedom Summit, Nov. 4, 2023, in Kissimmee, Fla.  (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) Asked for comment, Trump transition spokesman Alex Pfeiffer said: ""Matt Gaetz will be the next attorney general. He’s the right man for the job and will end the weaponization of our justice system.  ""These are baseless allegations intended to derail the second Trump administration. The Biden Justice Department investigated Gaetz for years and cleared him of wrongdoing. The only people who went to prison over these allegations were those lying about Matt Gaetz."" Trump is making calls on behalf of Gaetz, and J.D. Vance is escorting him and other nominees around the Hill.  The Times reports that Trump realizes that Gaetz may not be confirmed. This is a matter of simple math, since most GOP senators have not committed to supporting him. Yet the president-elect will not back off or force Gaetz to withdraw the nomination. But if Gaetz falls short, it would be hard for the Senate to reject a replacement nominee, who might have the same views on disrupting and perhaps politicizing the DOJ, but without the ex-congressman’s baggage.  The House ethics panel, while stymied by Gaetz’s abrupt resignation, is meeting today on the report.    CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP One new disclosure that could hurt him: Gaetz used his adopted son’s PayPal account to pay one of the women, who was not a minor. Doesn’t that sound like someone with something embarrassing to hide?  The Democrats have some influence in this process, as they’d only have to pick off four of the 53 GOP senators to block Matt Gaetz. But they are also consumed by their election shellacking and will have a hard time defeating Trump on just about anything.

244,General Politics,2024,11,Would the US win a war with China over Taiwan? US lawmakers briefed on the potential outcome,Morgan Phillips,"President Biden and China’s President Xi Jinping met on Saturday at the APEC Summit in Lima, Peru. (Reuters) House lawmakers were briefed Wednesday about the potential outcome if the U.S. were to find itself at war with China over Taiwan within the next two years, as the global superpower increasingly encroaches on U.S. allies.  The Chinese defense industrial base is operating at a ""wartime footing,"" and now has a shipbuilding capacity 230 times greater than the U.S.’s, making a potential invasion of Taiwan a not-unlikely outcome. U.S. military analysts have projected 2027 as the year by which China would be fully equipped for a military invasion of Taiwan. And the U.S. has long followed a policy of refusing to say whether it would come to the island’s defense under such a scenario.  But under war exercises gamed out by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) 25 times and presented to members of the House China Select Committee, the alliance of the U.S., Taiwan and Japan defeated an amphibious invasion by China and maintained an autonomous Taiwan, but not without suffering heavy losses.  WOULD THE US DEFEND TAIWAN UNDER TRUMP IF CHINA INVADES? FOX NEWS INVESTIGATES During the simulation, the cost for all sides was high — there were more than 10,000 casualties — and the U.S. lost 10-20 warships, two aircraft carriers, 200-400 warplanes and more than 3,000 troops were killed over the first three weeks of fighting.  China loses 90% of its amphibious fleet, 52 major surface warships and 160 warplanes.  ""In our tabletop exercise today, we walked through one simulation of what might happen in a worst-case scenario conflict with China and learned ways we can work together in a bipartisan manner to ensure that America is prepared to be the arsenal of democracy once more if called upon. No matter where or when, the United States and our allies must have the military means to defeat our adversaries,"" Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., chairman of the committee, told Fox News Digital.  A Chinese Coast Guard vessel patrols at the disputed Scarborough Shoal. (Castro/File Photo) The report emphasized four key points: 1) Taiwan must ""hold the line"" of the ground invasion, 2) there is no ""Ukraine"" model where the U.S. can slowly escalate — it must decide immediately whether it will come to Taiwan's defense, 3) military operations would need to be conducted through Japan and 4) the U.S. needs to immediately increase its supply of anti-ship missiles.  The bottom line of the report is that China chooses ""D-Day,"" but Taiwan and its defenders must be ready at any moment. The war game assumed a 2026 launch date for China’s invasion.  The scenario operates under the assumption that the U.S. under President-elect Trump would come to Taiwan’s defense, though no such promise has been made. It’s unclear what Trump would do under such a scenario — he has mused about Taiwan needing to pay the U.S. for giving it defensive aid. Japan would be the U.S. and Taiwan’s key ally in such a fight because South Korea has not authorized the U.S. to launch combat missions from its territory. CSIS recommends deepening U.S.-Japan diplomatic relations immediately.  XI JINPING WARNS TRUMP US WOULD 'LOSE FROM CONFRONTATION' WITH CHINA AS RENEWED TRADE WAR LOOMS ""It certainly would be very helpful if South Korea stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us,"" said Matthew Cancian, researcher at the Naval War College and lead author of the project. The U.S. would likely move two of the four squadrons it has stationed in South Korea to help with the fight against China over Taiwan.  But, as the presenters warned, North Korea may try to take advantage of the situation and invade the south, especially after gaining operational experience from their fight with Russia against Ukraine.  The exercise also claimed that unlike U.S. aid to Ukraine, which passes over NATO territory to arrive there, the U.S. would not be able to arm Taiwan without sending in U.S. forces — China’s anti-tank or anti-air missiles would threaten any shipments making their way to the island.  ""U.S. forces would have to be directly involved,"" said Cancian. ""There is no way to achieve denying a takeover of Taiwan while also keeping U.S. forces safe.""  And if the U.S. were to come to Taiwan's defense, there would be no time to waste since China is much closer geographically than U.S. forces. ""If the U.S. were not to join the fight for two weeks [after an invasion], it would be too late. China would already have too strong a footing,"" said Cancian.  Chinese land attack missiles and anti-ship missiles would pose the greatest threat in the theater. Harpoons and coastal defense cruise missiles would be ""absolutely critical"" to Taiwan’s defense, according to the wargame exercise.  China is outproducing the U.S. on airplanes, ships and missiles, the exercise found, and in order to deter them from provoking war over Taiwan, the U.S. needs to immediately ramp up its production of key munitions, per the war games.  The U.S.’s current stockpile of anti-ship missiles, around 440, would run out in less than seven days in a war with China.  China would not be keen to give up easily, as a loss in Taiwan could be ""very destabilizing"" to the government’s legitimacy back at home.  The war games also underscored the need for the Taiwanese defense budget to stop focusing on expensive, large ships that China will easily destroy and focus on smaller, more survivable ships and submarines.

(Sun Zifa/China News Service via Getty Images) The U.S., too, must focus on arming Taiwan with smaller ships and cheaper munitions, with most iterations of the war games finding the U.S. losing two aircraft carriers and 10 to 20 large surface combatants.  ""We need to make them fire their exquisite stuff at our non-exquisite stuff,"" said Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla. ""They’re going to out-produce us… we need to wake up.""  The U.S. and Taiwan must not attack the Chinese mainland, both to avoid risking escalation with a nuclear power and because Chinese air defense on the mainland is ""too strong.""  Ultimately, such an invasion could happen sooner, or not at all.  The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) head, Adm. Samuel Paparo, said recently he believes the U.S. would make it ""exceedingly difficult"" for China to mount a cross-strait invasion.  For years, the U.S. military has been pivoting its focus from the Middle East to the Indo-Pacific, ""the most stressing theater,"" as Paparo describes it, given that China is the most capable potential adversary in the world.  According to Chinese policy, the CCP will invade only if Taiwan declares its independence from China, if a third power intervenes in the dispute or Beijing determines that ""unification was irrevocably beyond its reach by any other means."" While the U.S. has no formal alliance with Taiwan, China has been encroaching on the air and sea territory of U.S. allies in the Pacific — Japan and the Philippines. Paparo said he'd seen ""the most rehearsal and the most joint exercises"" from China over the summer that ""I'd seen over an entire career of being an observer."" ""This included on one particular day 152 vessels at sea,"" Paparo added. China’s navy is the largest in the world, with more than 370 ships and submarines. The U.S.' battle force includes 295 vessels, including 11 active aircraft carriers.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""This was the largest rehearsal we've seen on an upward trajectory of PLA [People's Liberation Army] modernization,"" Paparo said, referring to the Chinese military’s name.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Republican leaders from Congress expressed ""serious concern"" with the Mountain West Conference about transgender women participating in women's sports. Thirteen officials signed a letter to Mountain West Commissioner Gloria Nevarez, urging the conference to prohibit transgender athletes from playing against biological women. ""We write with serious concerns about the safety and fair competition standards for female athletes participating in the Mountain West Conference,"" the letter, signed by members of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate, says. The letter was sent amid controversy at San Jose State University, where Blaire Fleming, a transgender woman, plays for the women's volleyball team.

(Kevin Langley/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) Several teams have forfeited games against the Spartans this season. ""Title IX was established over 50 years ago to even the playing field for women. Since its implementation, women have participated in safer and fairer competition — but recent events have shown this is at risk,"" the letter states.  ""Recently, members of your conference have forfeited games, risking their competitive standings to ensure the safety of their female athletes. The Mountain West Conference’s failure to prohibit biological males from competing in women’s sports is unfair to the women and girls who have worked tirelessly to compete at the collegiate level. We applaud the bravery of these female athletes and the universities in our home states for taking a stand to preserve Title IX when the Mountain West Conference would not. ""Permitting biological men to play in women’s sports is not equitable; it is an injustice. Under these guidelines, it is only fair that biological males play men’s sports and biological females play women’s sports. Clearly, the Mountain West Conference has dropped the ball.

We urge you to address these inequities in women’s sports in the Mountain West Conference immediately, and we look forward to working with you to support women in collegiate sports."" Fleming has been one of the top players in the conference and an offensive anchor for San Jose State this season, even amid the controversy. Fleming is third in the conference in average kills per serve with 3.86 and amassed 297 total kills on the year despite playing seven fewer games than expected due to forfeits. It's helped give San Jose State the third best hitting percentage in the Mountain West.  Fleming's teammate, Brooke Slusser, is a part of the lawsuit against the NCAA, and she filed another suit alongside other Mountain West players against the conference over the alleged presence of her transgender teammate. Slusser has alleged the school deliberately hid Fleming's natural birth sex from her and other players on the team and around the conference.

246,Congress,2024,11,Senate showdown: GOP secures deal with Schumer to save coveted appellate judges for Trump,Haley Chi-Sing,"Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith has more on Senate Democrats pushing to approve judicial nominees ahead of Trump's return to White House on 'Special Report.' FIRST ON FOX: Senate Democrats and Republicans struck a late-night deal on judicial votes and confirmations on Wednesday, securing the ability for President-elect Trump to appoint four crucial appellate court judges in his second administration.  As Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., attempts to push through as many President Biden judicial picks as possible, Republicans in the upper chamber have worked to delay the process by using procedural floor maneuvers, causing several late nights. Around midnight on Wednesday, the parties came to an agreement which would allow Democrats to hold votes on four district court judges in exchange for pulling four higher tier circuit court judicial nominees, a senior GOP Senate source familiar with the matter told Fox News Digital.  SENATE GOP INITIATES THUNE-ENGINEERED SLOWDOWN AS SCHUMER LOOKS TO STACK JUDICIAL VOTES These four vacancies will now be Trump's to fill, per the deal, the source said.  However, a Senate Democrat leadership aide familiar with the agreement said the deal that was reached allowed for the Senate to vote on cloture on nine district court judges this week, and vote to confirm them when they return after Thanksgiving. The aide rejected the GOP source's framing of the agreement that the trade was four district judges for four circuit court judges. ""The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward,"" a spokesperson for Schumer said in a statement. A Democrat source familiar also made the point to Fox News Digital that only two of the circuit court vacancies are certain, and the other two may ultimately decide against taking senior judge status. Around 11 p.m. on Wednesday, Schumer's office said, ""The Senate has reached a time agreement to invoke cloture on four judicial nominations tonight and have three more votes tomorrow."" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., left, and Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who will be the Senate majority leader in the next Congress. (Reuters) The senior GOP source told Fox News Digital that Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., were both key figures in securing the near-midnight deal.  The office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., did not immediately provide comment to Fox News Digital.  SPRINT TO CONFIRM TRUMP NOMINEES KICKS OFF IN JANUARY The deal was primarily motivated by a Senate slowdown initiated by Republicans through procedural maneuvers on Monday night, which was spearheaded by Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who was recently elected as the next Republican Senate leader. The delay tactic plan came in response to Schumer's efforts to stack additional judicial confirmation votes on the calendar ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.  ""If Sen. Schumer thought Senate Republicans would just roll over and allow him to quickly confirm multiple Biden-appointed judges to lifetime jobs in the final weeks of the Democrat majority, he thought wrong,"" Thune told Fox News Digital in an exclusive statement at the time.  The deal was primarily motivated by a Senate slowdown initiated by Republicans through procedural maneuvers on Monday night, which was spearheaded by Thune. (Reuters) By objecting to Democrats' unanimous consent requests in order to file cloture on the Biden nominees, Republicans were adding additional votes to the schedule, taking up a substantial amount of time and forcing senators to spend all night at the Capitol. The source noted to Fox News Digital that the new deal did not mean Republicans were going to allow the Biden district judges to sail through without opposition. GOP senators are still expected to fight and vote against the Democrat-nominated judges as they have done throughout Biden's term.   At the center of the deal was Republicans agreeing not to stall the Senate's votes on cloture or confirmation for the nine district judge confirmations by denying unanimous consent, the Democrat aide explained.  SCHUMER NOW PLEADS FOR BI-PARTISANSHIP HAVING PROMISED TO RAILROAD DEMOCRAT AGENDA THROUGH Ahead of Trump taking office and a new congressional term starting in January with Republicans in the Senate majority, Democrats are in a race to the finish line to push through as many of President Biden's judicial nominations as possible. As of Wednesday night, Biden's judicial confirmation count went up to 220 — still trailing behind Trump's 234 confirmed Article III judges during his first term.  Schumer's effort to push through Biden judges quickly during the lame duck session has already drawn the ire of Trump.  Schumer talks after a policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 24. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File) He recently took to social media to call for a halt to judicial confirmations for the remainder of the session, writing on social media on Wednesday, ""The Democrats are trying to stack the Courts with Radical Left Judges on their way out the door.

""We must take action to avoid diving headfirst off the cliff of fiscal ruin… Our DOGE Caucus, will work closely with the Department of Government Efficiency to help rein in reckless spending and stop the abuse of taxpayer dollars.""

Derek Merrin, according to The Associated Press, which called the race Wednesday at 1:02 p.m. With 99% of precincts reporting, Kaptur led Merrin with 48.27% of the vote to 47.63%, a lead of 2,382 votes.  Though the race was not called on election night, Kaptur had declared victory early on Nov. 6. Her win will keep the incoming Republican House majority at 218 seats, while Democrats hold 213.  ""Tonight, the people of Ohio’s 9th District have spoken, and I am deeply grateful for the trust they have placed in me to continue fighting for working families, creating good-paying jobs, protecting healthcare for everyone, and securing Social Security and Medicare so Ohioans can retire with dignity,"" her campaign said in a statement. ""This campaign has always been about the strength and resilience of our communities, and tonight we celebrate not just a victory but a renewed commitment to the belief that what America makes and grows, makes and grows America.""

Heading into the election, Republicans were optimistic they could flip the seat after redistricting following the 2020 census brought more Trump-friendly areas into the district.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Republicans are gearing up for a trifecta of control in Congress next year with a heightened focus on legislation against transgender medical procedures on minors.  During a Senate panel on Wednesday afternoon, lawmakers discussed the future of legislative action in Congress, such as bans on biological males competing in women's sports, restrictions on gender-related surgery on minors and cessation of taxpayer funding of these types of procedures for children, and expanding parental consent requirements. The discussion was hosted by Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., and was led by Terry Schilling, president of the American Principles Project (APP). Schilling interviewed Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., and Paula Scanlan, a swimmer who shared her experience of competing alongside Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete on the women’s team at the University of Pennsylvania.

256,Congress,2024,11,Mission for DOGE: Word limits could revolutionize government efficiency,Aron Ping D’Souza,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss President-elect Trump choosing Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. In an era where simplicity drives success — from viral tweets to lean startup principles — government remains a bastion of unnecessary complexity. Legislation, regulations, court filings and judgments routinely balloon into labyrinths of legalese, alienating citizens, overburdening officials and stalling justice.  It’s time for a radical, but simple, reform: implementing word limits to ensure brevity and clarity across government processes. This isn’t just an abstract idea; it’s an actionable vision for President Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). For DOGE’s leaders, Elon Musk, whose companies thrive on efficiency and innovation, and for Vivek Ramaswamy, this proposal should be the foundation of improving how America works.  President-elect Trump on Nov. 12 announced Elon Musk, left, and Vivek Ramaswamy would be leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). (Getty Images) Modern governance is drowning in words. At over 6,000 pages, the U.S. tax code is a prime example of how excessive complexity creates inefficiency. In the last 50 years, the IRS code has grown from 1.5 million words to nearly 10 million today. Regulations from federal agencies often span thousands of pages, rife with jargon that’s nearly impossible for the average citizen — or even experts — to decipher. RAMASWAMY OUTLINES DOGE'S VISION TO BRING 'SWEEPING CHANGE' TO BUREAUCRACY: 'RESTORING... ACCOUNTABILITY' Court processes are no better. Legal briefs can run into hundreds of pages, and judicial opinions often resemble epic sagas more than simple judgments. The result? Delays, confusion, obfuscation and significant costs that disproportionately harm small businesses, individuals and under-resourced communities. Lawyers are incentivized to make the simple complex to increase their billable hours.  This tangled web doesn’t just slow progress; it breeds distrust. When government is unintelligible, it becomes inaccessible, undermining its legitimacy. MORNING GLORY: DON’T DOGE THE DEADLINE! A mandatory word limit for laws, regulations and legal documents would be a game-changer. Much like Twitter’s early character limit forced users to distill their thoughts, word limits in governance would encourage disciplined drafting, accessible language and a sharper focus on priorities. The government could prioritize clarity, reduce waste and streamline decision-making by capping verbosity. Here’s what that might look like: 'DOGE' MEETS CONGRESS: GOP LAWMAKER LAUNCHES CAUCUS TO HELP MUSK TAKE ON 'CRAZYTOWN’ History shows us that brevity works. The U.S. Constitution, the foundation of American governance, contains fewer than 5,000 words. Contrast that with sprawling modern bills like the Affordable Care Act, which spans over 2,000 pages. Internationally, countries like New Zealand and Singapore prioritize plain-language laws and regulations, earning them reputations for efficiency and transparency. America can — and should — follow suit. Skeptics might argue that word limits oversimplify complex issues. But complexity and verbosity are not the same. Word limits wouldn’t eliminate nuance; they’d force writers to clarify priorities and sharpen arguments. Excessive detail often obscures more than it reveals. ELON MUSK SAYS 'ALL ACTIONS' TAKEN BY DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY WILL BE ONLINE: 'TRANSPARENCY' Additionally, this reform wouldn’t be a blunt instrument. Different types of documents — legislation, regulations, court opinions — would have tailored limits to balance brevity with necessity. The introduction of word limits could begin with pilot programs — possibly a feature of the new Department of Government Efficiency. Congress could experiment with caps on nonessential legislation, while agencies like the SEC or FDA could test simplified rulemaking processes.  The benefits would ripple across the system: faster decisions, lower costs and a government that people can actually understand.

Delaware set off a firestorm this month after it elected the first transgender woman to Congress, leading some Republicans to demand the new lawmaker be barred from women’s bathrooms. Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, currently a Democrat state senator for President Biden’s hometown of Claymont, Delaware, defeated retired Delaware State Trooper John Whalen III, 58%-42%. McBride succeeds Rep. Lisa Blunt-Rochester, D-Del., who won the retiring Tom Carper’s open U.S. Senate seat. Rep.

Mace said Tuesday she is now receiving death threats, adding that she is the one being ""unfairly targeted."" Mace drafted resolution H.R. 1579 on Monday which would prohibit members, officers and employees of the House from using facilities other than those corresponding to their biological sex.

Bryan Steil, R-Wis., but did not appear to have come to a vote yet. The bill would direct House Sergeant-at-Arms William McFarland to enforce the new provision. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., told reporters she supports Mace’s resolution and called McBride ""mentally ill."" ""Sarah McBride, as he calls himself, formerly Tim McBride, is a biological man, and he should not be using any of our restrooms in the Capitol and those in our office buildings,"" Greene said. ""Nancy Mace's resolution doesn't go far enough. Her resolution is just a statement by Congress saying that Congress disagrees with something. We need something more binding."" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R–La., a noted social conservative, said he’s ""not going to get into this."" ""We welcome all new members with open arms who are duly elected representatives of the people. I believe it's a command that we treat all persons with dignity and respect, that we will. And I'm not going to engage in silly debates about this."" Johnson added that the issue of gender identity in locker rooms and bathrooms is not something Congress has had to address before and thus deserves honest deliberation and ""member consensus."" ""And we will accommodate the needs of every single person,"" the speaker added. Greene said the situation reminds her of how student-athletes were forced to compete against biological males who are physiologically stronger as a baseline. ""There is a volleyball player that has brain damage today because of a biological male spiking a ball into her head."" In that regard, former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines, who was forced to compete against a transgender University of Pennsylvania swimmer, slammed McBride’s pointed response to criticisms. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images/File) ""And even after his temper tantrum, he's still a man,"" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. Gaines is an OutKick.com contributor and the host of the ""Gaines for Girls"" podcast. In a 2015 story in American’s college magazine, McBride said, ""My father said to me that he was not losing a son but gaining a daughter. That was one of the most profound moments in my transition. It was a major relief when it was clear that both my parents saw me as who I am."" In earlier comments about her resolution, Mace said she is a rape survivor and still has PTSD from her abuse at the hands of a man. Later Tuesday, Mace said the issue is protecting women and girls and making sure Congress acts in accordance. ""[McBride] doesn't get a say. This is about real women and women's rights and the far-left radical left. They want to erase women and women's rights, and I'm not going to let them,"" she said.  ""Here's the deal: Biological men shouldn't be in women's private spaces, period, end of story,"" she said. Rep.

259,Congress,2024,11,"Matt Gaetz 'working the phones,' speaking to GOP senators despite difficult confirmation odds",Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on how Congress is gearing up to quickly confirm President-elect Trump’s Cabinet on ‘Special Report.’ Former Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who President-elect Trump announced as his selection to be attorney general during his second term, is making calls to Senate Republicans ahead of his confirmation hearing next year.  Several GOP senators told reporters this week that they spoke with Gaetz by phone since Trump picked him to lead the Department of Justice (DOJ).  A source familiar told Fox News Digital that the former congressman ""is dedicated to winning the support of senators for his nomination for the attorney general,"" noting that ""he has been working the phones."" SENATE GOP INITIATES THUNE-ENGINEERED SLOW DOWN AS SCHUMER LOOKS TO STACK JUDICIAL VOTES Rep. Matt Gaetz speaks at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 17, 2024. (Reuters/Mike Segar) Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said Monday night that he spoke with Gaetz days prior. ""He called me,"" he said. ""Very brief conversation."" The senator would not divulge any additional information about their call. Mullin and Gaetz have had a tense relationship in the past, and the senator slammed him in an interview at the time, bringing up allegations that he had slept with an underage girl.  ""There's a reason why no one in the conference came and defended him because we had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor… of the girls that he had slept with. He’d brag about how he would crush [erectile dysfunction] medicine and chase it with an energy drink so he could go all night,"" he said at the time.  GOP CRIES FOUL ON DEM BORDER SPENDING BILL THEY SAY WOULD DRAG OUT MIGRANT CRISIS Mullin and Gaetz have had a tense relationship. (Tom Williams/Al Drago) Gaetz denied Mullin's claim when he made it. Gaetz has not been convicted of charges related to these allegations. He was previously under a yearlong investigation by the DOJ that was prompted by allegations that he had a sexual relationship with a minor. However, the DOJ ultimately decided against pressing any charges.  The comments came amid former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's removal, which Gaetz was partially credited with.  Mullin recently said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" the Senate should ""absolutely"" have access to the House Ethics report that probed allegations into Gaetz, including sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts.  Not every Republican senator has been willing to go as far, with many being vague about whether senators should see it or will ultimately see the report during a confirmation hearing.  SPENDING BILL TROUBLE BREWS AS SEN MIKE LEE WARNS OF CHRISTMAS 'SWAMPBUS' Hawley said he spoke with Gaetz. (AP) Mullin, a close ally of Trump in the Senate, said he hasn't spoken to the president-elect about the selection of Gaetz.   Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., also said he spoke to Gaetz. ""Had a nice chat with Matt Gaetz over the weekend,"" he revealed on Monday. ""He wants to have the chance to clear his name in a hearing. And I think that's a great idea."" ""And I think we ought to have a hearing. I think we ought to move to it as quickly as we can in the new Congress."" ""The other night, before I left for the weekend, I don't know about 10:30 or 11, I got a phone call from Congressman Gaetz, and I congratulated him, and he said, ‘Will I get a fair shake in the Senate?’"" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said.  ""And I said, 'Absolutely. Just come on over, answer all the questionnaires, tell us the truth, tell us what your plans are for the agency, and I'm looking forward to it, and I hope you are too.'"" THUNE 'ADAMANT' ABOUT TRUMP SUPPORT, DRIVING MAGA AGENDA DESPITE TENSE PAST RELATIONSHIP Kennedy said Gaetz called him. (Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Kennedy said the conversation was quick and that the two don't have plans for an in-person meeting yet.  A source familiar told Fox News Digital that Vice President-elect JD Vance is planning to make the rounds on Capitol Hill this week, scheduling meetings with key Republican senators and Trump Cabinet nominees Gaetz and Pete Hegseth, who was selected by the preisdent-elect to run the Department of Defense (DOD.) ""President Trump’s incoming administration is moving at an accelerated schedule in order to make good on getting key nominees confirmed in order to start delivering for the American people. Rep. Collins (VA), Rep. Gaetz (DOJ), Pete Hegseth (DOD), and Rep. Stefanik (UN) will all begin their meetings this week with additional Hill visits to continue after the Thanksgiving recess,"" Brian Hughes, a Trump-Vance Transition spokesman, said in a statement to Fox News Digital. Gaetz faces an uphill battle when it comes to a potential confirmation in the Senate, as it would take just a handful of Republican votes to deny him. The Senate GOP will only have a 53-person majority next year and several GOP senators have already expressed concerns about Gaetz.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""He will never get confirmed,"" a Republican senator, granted anonymity to speak freely, told Fox News Digital after Trump's selection was revealed. One Senate Republican source simply said, ""Ain’t gonna happen,"" about the prospect of Gaetz's confirmation.

260,Congress,2024,11,Pentagon solves one of its highest-profile UFO mysteries,Michael Dorgan,"Pentagon officials Dr. Jon Kosloski explains how the DOD solved the GOFAST UFO mystery of an object flying at a high speed just above water. A pentagon official told Congress Tuesday that the agency has solved a prominent UFO mystery from 2016 which showed what appeared to be an object flying at a high speed just above water. The object was recorded by a fighter jet from the USS Theodore Roosevelt off the east coast of Florida in 2016 and became known as the ""GOFAST"" video when it was made public the following year. The grainy, black and white video, is from a fighter jet’s head-up display and eventually locks onto the object and the pilot can be heard shouting: ""Ohhh, got it!... Oh my gosh dude."" UFO HEARING: EX-PENTAGON OFFICIAL SAYS GOVERNMENT 'CABAL' IS HIDING 'THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE' Dr. Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (C-SPAN)  Dr. Jon Kosloski, the director of the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), which is tasked with investigating UFOs, or what the Pentagon calls unidentified anomalous phenomena (UPA), says that the object was not anomalous — or out of the ordinary — and hovering over the water but was in fact 13,000 feet above the sea.  He said the phenomenon was caused by a trick of the eye"" called parallax, which made it look like the object is moving much faster. ""Through a very careful geospatial intelligence analysis and using trigonometry, we assess with high confidence that the object is not actually close to the water, but is rather closer to 13,000 feet,"" said Kosloski, who added that the office has a detailed analysis of the parallax phenomenon on its website. He said the object, which he did not identify, traveled in a relatively straight, riding trajectory with a slow curving descent near the end of the analyzed video.  RUSSIAN UFO ENGAGEMENTS, SECRET ‘TIC TAC’ REPORT AND 3 KEY FIGURES SLIP UNDER RADAR AT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING Kosloski also presented two other resolved cases the Defense Department calls ""The Puerto Rico Objects"" and ""Mt. Etna,"" the latter which was captured in 2018 from a UAV flying in the Mediterranean watching Mount Etna as it was erupting. He said he believed the public was not familiar with it.  ""And it appears that that object is flying through the plume of superheated gas and ash,"" Kosloski said.  The grainy, black and white video, is from a fighter jet’s head-up display and eventually locks onto the object. (Defense Department) ""This was a rather difficult case to resolve. We had to pull in support from a number of IC and S&T partners and even reach out to a volcanologist. And through very detailed remodeling and pixel-by-pixel analysis of the object as it’s traversing across the clouds, they assess that the object was actually 170 meters away from the plume and not flying through it."" He said his office is still actively investigating cases with an ""orange orb"" and ""a metallic cylinder.""  Kosloski was speaking in front of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. The Department of Defense created the AARO in 2022 so military and government personnel could report UFO sightings in one place. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The 2016 video shows what appears to be an object flying at a high speed just above water. (Defense Department) He said AARO has ""not discovered any verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology."" Kosloski said that despite having resolved hundreds of cases, his office does not believe that every UAP is a bird, balloon or drone. ""We do have some very anomalous objects,"" he said. It is in contrast to Luiz Elizondo, the former head of the Defense Department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), who testified to Congress last week that ""we are not alone in the cosmos,"" and that a ""cabal"" of officials is hiding the information. The AATIP was tasked with investigating UAPs. Michael Dorgan is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business. You can send tips to michael.dorgan@fox.com and follow him on Twitter @M_Dorgan.

261,Congress,2024,11,Morning Glory: Worried about the national debt?,Hugh Hewitt,"'Outnumbered' panelists discuss former President Trump's X interview with Elon Musk. If Congress won’t slash the spending that constitutes low-hanging fruit – subsidies for National Public Radio, for example, or mandatory reductions-in-force across the vast federal government – there is no point in attempting to warn voters about the national debt. If Congress and the president don’t care about small stuff when it comes to controlling the national debt, why should voters believe the debt is a problem that warrants entitlement reform? If you won’t lose five pounds, should anyone believe you are going to shed 100? Young people worry about the impacts of climate change – a lot. Of course they do. How could they not, given media and elementary and secondary school curricula? Some research suggests 60% or more of high school students will tell surveyors that they view climate change as ""an existential threat."" Given how much time and attention is spent on cataclysmic rhetoric about climate change, it is surprising the number isn’t 95%

How about the national debt? Five years ago, Brooking Institute scholar Stuart Butler worried that very few Millennials cared about the national debt despite the projection that the national debt ""is rising rapidly and will be close to 150% of GDP by 2050,"" and that the total ""would easily surpass the previous record during World War II.""  STOP THE INSANITY. OUR NATIONAL DEBT NOW TOPS $35 TRILLION… Butler – respected across the political spectrum – noted a ""lot of frustration among economists and policymakers about the seeming unwillingness of young Americans to appreciate the enormous threat posed by deficits and debt."" ""Prophesying fiscal disaster and urging action is a challenging line of work these days,"" he concluded. NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - JANUARY 19: A screen shows the national debt clock after the US hit its debt limit and the Treasury started using extraordinary measures to avoid default on January 19, 2023. (Photo by Fatih Aktas/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) It’s not going to get easier because the electorate does not care about the national debt. Not even young voters care, even though they are going to get stuck with the tab as the last tranche of Boomers bolt the workforce for retirement or eternity. Voters under the age of 30 favored Vice President Harris by a few points in this month’s election, but in crucial states like Michigan it was a statistical tie. The gender gap that played out in 2024 was also present among young voters. The issues that mattered were very different among the young voters choosing Harris over Trump, but neither camp was concerned with the national debt.  CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION  The national debt of the United States is approximately $36 trillion dollars. The Peter G. Peterson Foundation keeps a steady eye on the total debt and on the interest cost of that debt, which is presently almost $2 billion a day, an interest-only slice of the federal budget which is expected to double over the next decade. All of the presidents and all of the members of the House and the Senate of the past 75 years are responsible for spending the $36 trillion which we have collectively borrowed. But neither President-elect Trump nor his successor or their successor will be able to do much about the debt, even as it eats into the future prosperity of every American. Because the electorate simply shrugs off these numbers. Because voters do not care about the debt, the debt won’t be addressed in the first or second budgets of the second Trump term or the laws that pass pursuant to the reconciliation process those budgets unlock. The debt will in all likelihood grow to more than 40 trillion before the 2026 elections have changed Congress again. That’s because President-elect Trump and the Senate and House will agree to extend and revise (and hopefully make permanent) the Trump tax cuts from 2018 and the productivity jolt that certainty about tax rates brings will take some years to show up in total tax receipts. Debt doomsayers are everywhere and everywhere ignored. Reporters in the New York Times warned this week that ""[b]udget experts have warned that his plans could add as much as $15 trillion to the national debt while increasing inflation and slowing growth."" Hard to know on what such predictions are based given that we don’t have any idea what the first budget will look like much less the second. But this story was a flare to the rest of legacy media that the left has decided that annual federal budget deficits and the total national debt matter again after President Biden’s four-year spending spree. There will be more coverage of the debt because with the GOP in control, legacy media will want to blame Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill. But will all the hand-wringing ahead result in the national debt registering as an issue among voters? Nah. Not a chance. 03 October 2024, USA, Washington: View of the White House. Photo: Valerie Plesch/dpa (Photo by Valerie Plesch/picture alliance via Getty Images)  (Valerie Plesch) Inflation mattered in the election – a lot. So did the ""wrong direction"" number as super-majorities of Americans concluded Bidenomics was a disaster. Stagflation was the undoing of President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 election and it was the undoing of Vice President Harris on November 5. Americans want the economy to boom, not contract or slink along. Trump’s tax cuts being made permanent could unleash productivity again. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But don’t expect spending cuts that matter or new revenue streams from any source unless and until there are at least gestures made by the Congress about cutting the cost of the federal government. Don’t blame the public for its indifference to alarms over the debt when Congress is still pulsing grants through the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. If the Congress cannot be serious about obvious cuts of agencies and subsidies that ought never to have been begun, don’t expect it to bring an axe to entitlements or to trot out new tax proposals. If the debt alarms you, figure out a way to express the risk it poses to future generations the way that climate alarmists have persuaded Millennials, Generation Z and Generation Aloha that the future is dark because the planet is going to cook. Young voters worry about getting jobs and buying first houses or about the climate and abortion rights. Don’t expect them, much less the beneficiaries of entitlements, to demand fiscal responsibility unless and until Congress at least makes a show of shaving off the obvious fat.
