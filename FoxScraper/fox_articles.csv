1,General Politics,2024,11,Ex-CNN boss rips media 'hyperbole' on Trump: Their 'end of democracy' claims will lead to 'credibility' crisis,Joseph A. Wulfsohn,"'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the media's outrage over Vice President Harris' election loss. Former CNN boss Chris Licht took a swipe at the ""hyperbole"" from the legacy media leading up to last week's historic victory of President-elect Donald Trump.  Speaking at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference Tuesday, Licht was asked how the media can regain trust as the country embraces a second Trump administration.  His advice to his media colleagues: ""Swing at the pitches that are thrown."" ""To completely butcher a Chris Rock phrase, if someone kills eight people, don't say they killed nine,"" Licht said. ""[Trump's] going to do enough things that really require scrutiny and sounding the alarm bells. Don't say, 'Well, this means this, and that means that's going to happen.' Say he did this, and then let's discuss what that means. Not, ‘Well this is going to mean this’ because a lot of times the media gets in trouble when they predict things.""  CNN STAFFERS ‘DEEPLY FRUSTRATED’ AS LOOMING BUDGET CUTS, LAYOFFS SET TO IMPACT STRUGGLING NETWORK Ex-CNN chairman Chris Licht slammed the ""hyperbole"" coming from the legacy media about a second Trump presidency. (Kevin Mazur/Getty Images) Licht, who was ousted as CNN's chairman and CEO in June 2023 after barely over a year on the job, pointed to the ""hyperbole"" he had seen as a media observer regarding what a second Trump presidency would bring. ""'It's the end of democracy.' Well, if it's not, if four years from now it's not, then we have a problem with credibility,"" Licht said. ""So instead, 'He's appointed this person, this is this person's track record,' not 'that means he's going to do this,' right?"" CHRIS WALLACE OUT AT CNN AFTER 3 YEARS AT THE NETWORK ""There will be enough to discuss. There will be enough things that are going to be controversial. But he and his people know exactly what they're doing when they try to gin up what one of my former colleagues called outrage porn. If everything is an 11, and everything is outrageous, then you're able to kind of slip through some things that actually should create that outrage,"" he added.  Licht said the media will have a ""credibility"" problem if democracy is still around after President-elect Trump's second term.  (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Licht was handpicked by Warner Bros. Discovery chief David Zaslav in 2022 to help revive CNN's viewership and restore its journalistic credibility after the network spent years building a reputation for being an anti-Trump news organization under predecessor Jeff Zucker.  CNN's rank-and-file resisted Licht's efforts to remove the spectacle from its coverage. Among his major moves were dismissing prominent liberal on-air figures, including Brian Stelter, Don Lemon and Jeffrey Toobin. However, Licht had completely lost the trust of CNN staff after the network hosted the now-infamous Trump town hall in May 2023, which sparked unprecedented fury from within the newsroom. Licht was fired by Zaslav weeks later.  MEDIA RECKONING: WHERE ARE THE PRO-TRUMP DISSENTING VOICES AT LIBERAL NEWS ORGANIZATIONS? Fast-forward to November 2024 as financial woes and dismal viewership continue to plague the network. Many of Licht's decisions were reversed – Stelter was rehired as a media analyst, and Toobin and Lemon have made multiple appearances as guests – and CNN's anti-Trump coverage came back in a roaring fashion through Election Day.  CNN has been plagued with dwindling viewership in recent years.

3,General Politics,2024,11,Republicans to huddle behind closed doors to elect McConnell's successor Wednesday,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the Republican Senate leadership battle. The incoming Senate Republican Conference will meet to hold secret ballot elections for several leadership positions on Wednesday morning, including the successor of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will lead the Republican majority next year. At 9:30 a.m., the conference for the 119th Congress will select a new leader, Republican whip, conference chair, Republican policy committee chair, vice conference chair and National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRS) chair. Those vying for the coveted leader role are Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla.  Senators John Cornyn, John Thune and Rick Scott are being speculated as contenders in the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as leader. (Getty Images) On Tuesday, 42 GOP senators gathered for a leader candidate forum led by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Several of the lawmakers expressed satisfaction with how the discussion went, and Scott ended the evening by adding two additional endorsements.  According to Lee, the Republicans discussed a range of issues, some procedural, some substantive, and some policy-oriented.  President-elect Donald Trump notably has not made an endorsement in the Senate leader race. Scott's race, however, has gained the support of high-profile Trump allies like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and X owner Elon Musk.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., is running unopposed for NRSC chair. Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Tom Cotton, R-Ark., will face off for the No. 3 GOP role of conference chair. The Wednesday morning elections will take place in the old Senate chamber in the Capitol. Before each race, each candidate will have two nominating speeches from other senators. Then they'll make their own case. There may be some discussion before senators vote, and the secret ballot will remain private unless individual senators decide to disclose who they chose. Even then, there is no way to verify.

7,General Politics,2024,11,A major swing in these voter groups helped carry Trump to victory,Fox News,"Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams joins contributors Karl Rove and Jason Chaffetz discuss Kamala Harris' struggles in Pennsylvania on 'The Story.' This election cycle, the political landscape in the United States has witnessed significant transformations, particularly among Hispanic and Native American communities. Traditionally associated with the Democratic Party, these groups have shown signs of shifting their allegiances toward the Republican Party. Tuesday, November 5th, will go down in history as one of the world’s greatest political comebacks. After years of politicized investigations and the entire bureaucratic state coming after him, Donald Trump secured an electoral landslide and won back the White House. By focusing on the kitchen table issues that matter to all Americans, regardless of their identity – inflation, illegal immigration, foreign affairs, public safety – Donald Trump was able to expand not only his electoral map but also his electorate. TRUMP TRAIN CHUGS PAST 2020 MARGINS, PARTICULARLY AMONG HISPANICS, URBAN NORTHEASTERNERS Despite both Republicans and Democrats courting the Hispanic and Native American votes, exit polls from Tuesday night found that President Donald Trump received support from almost 65% of Native American voters and 45% of Hispanic voters. OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA - OCTOBER 14: Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump, holds a town hall at the Greater Philadelphia Expo Center with South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem on October 14, 2024 in Oaks, Pennsylvania. His rival, Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, is speaking in Western Pennsylvania city of Erie.  (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) However, these trends are not just unique to the American Southwest. In North Carolina, the once loyally blue Lumbee shifted 36 points to the right in 2020, giving Donald Trump critical votes necessary to win the state. In 2024, Donald Trump expanded his victory amongst tribal members, receiving 63% of the vote in Lumbee-heavy Robeson County. When studying this trend and understanding the impact it will have on election outcomes in the future, it is important to look at why Native American and Latino voters shifted. On the issues, like many Americans, the traditional cultural values of both Hispanics and Native Americans simply do not align with the woke left. At the core of both Hispanic and Native American cultures lies a deep respect for the family unit, traditional gender roles, respect for elders, tradition, God and the sacredness of life. These long-standing cultural values align better with the Republican Party. Another key issue, particularly for tribes and Hispanic voters in New Mexico, Arizona, and Nevada, is illegal immigration. While Democrats wrongly assumed Hispanic voters would align with their open-border immigration policies, Hispanics, just like all Americans, want safer communities, too. Native Americans witnessed the Biden-Harris administration roll out the red carpet and at least $150 billion of funding to non-citizens, while many of our own Native American populations don’t have access to running water or electricity. President Trump’s straightforward immigration policy resonates with all Americans. Trump greets Vance at an election night watch party in Palm Beach, Fla.  (AP/Evan Vucci) The concept of the American Dream is also a powerful motivator for many Hispanic and Native American voters. Native Americans on the reservation have experienced some of the highest rates of poverty, destruction and despair as a result of socialist policies – as well as many Hispanics who’ve left communist countries like Cuba and Venezuela. We have a natural distrust of big government socialist policies advanced by far-left Democrats – as many Americans should. No amount of gaslighting from the Harris-Walz campaign could erase the tangible economic results delivered under Trump’s presidency. Native Americans and Hispanics, like all Americans, have hope and aspirations for a better future, rooted in the belief that anyone, regardless of their background, can succeed through hard work and determination. Trump’s policies emphasized this narrative and delivered opportunity and progress. As a Native American and Hispanic woman from the heart of Indian country, Gallup, New Mexico – which is also in a Hispanic majority state, I have worked to bridge the gap between the Republican Party and Native and Hispanic communities. For the first time in recent memory, Donald Trump’s Republican Party made it their mission to earn the trust and support of these communities, and it paid off. CNN and MSNBC became reliable anti-Trump echo chambers during his first term. (Jovanny Hernandez/Milwaukee Journal Sentinel / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn Images) Though it was not enough to win in a state like New Mexico, Donald Trump’s outreach to our community put him within six points of winning, a five point improvement from 2020. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In the last week of his campaign, President Trump came to our state and spoke directly to our communities. New Mexico was never in play this cycle, but he seized the opportunity to make inroads and pushed the needle closer, improving his performances and appealing to a new group of mobilized voters. Groundwork has been laid, a presence has been felt and a movement has begun. Flipping a reliably blue state takes time and with the Republican National Committee and Trump apparatus committed to improving Hispanic and Native American outreach in rural communities that were once reliably blue, we can begin to build a stronger bridge into these communities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The potential for Hispanic and Native American communities to lean towards the Republican Party becomes increasingly plausible.

8,General Politics,2024,11,"Trump cabinet picks delight Taiwan, send strong signal to China",Eryk Michael Smith,"Fox News host Jesse Watters has the latest on the political announcement on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.' KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan - President-elect Donald Trump’s nominees to serve as United Nations ambassador, national security adviser, and most importantly, secretary of state are regarded by many as ""China Hawks.""  Their appointments are being mostly welcomed in Taiwan, even by some who did not support the former and future president. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., likely to be tapped to become Trump’s chief diplomat, made his position clear during the Republican National Convention in mid-July, when he said that he expected a re-elected Trump to, ""continue to do what he did in his first term and that is … continue to support Taiwan."" Rubio, however, has been in lockstep with Trump on insisting Taiwan increase defense spending, a view shared by security experts, but not necessarily the majority of Taiwanese people.  As of yet, no official statement has come from Taiwanese President William Lai, but in 2019, when Lai was vice president to then-President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs offered its gratitude to Sen. Rubio and former Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., for rejecting Chinese President Xi Jinping’s proposal (or demand) that Taiwan accept ""one country, two systems.""  TRUMP'S PICKS SO FAR: HERE'S WHO WILL BE ADVISING THE NEW PRESIDENT Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te, center, and his wife Wu Mei-Ju, left, with Vice President Hsiao Bi-khim gesture during his inauguration ceremony at the Presidential Palace in Taipei, Taiwan, on Monday, May 20, 2024. (An Rong Xu/Bloomberg via Getty Images) This same formula was supposed to apply to Hong Kong for 50 years after the handover in 1997 but lasted only until roughly 2020, when China imposed draconian new laws. Today, people in Hong Kong can be jailed for non-violent acts of protest, such as wearing a shirt with the words ""Liberate Hong Kong."" An overwhelming majority in Taiwan reject China’s ""one country, two systems,"" and any other plan that gives authoritarian China control of democratic Taiwan.  Rubio is blunt on China, writing on X, for example, ""Communist China is not, and will never be, a friend to democratic nations."" In May 2022, Rubio introduced the ""Taiwan Peace Through Strength Act,"" a bill that would fast-track U.S.-Taiwan military coordination. Rubio stated in connection to the bill that, ""Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not the first time an authoritarian regime invaded its neighbor and, unfortunately, it won’t be the last. An invasion of Taiwan could happen within this decade. Taiwan needs our support, and my bill will make Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party think twice before launching a foolish invasion. We must do all we can to deter an attack on Taiwan, or we risk losing the Indo-Pacific region to the Chinese Communist Party."" Rubio as a potential secretary of state is a problem for China, as the Florida Republican is blacklisted, or in more diplomatic terms, ""sanctioned."" Rubio was among the 11 U.S. senators China sanctioned in 2020 for their ""wrong U.S. behaviors … who have behaved egregiously on Hong Kong-related issues.""  CHINA OFFICIALLY 'DOESN'T CARE' ABOUT TRUMP WIN; UNOFFICIALLY, EXPERTS SAY BEIJING IS RATTLED Former President Donald Trump, left, greets Sen. Marco Rubio during a campaign rally at the J.S. Dorton Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Nov. 4, 2024. (Photo by Ryan M. Kelly / AFP) How to have ""meaningful dialogues"" with a person banned from China remains to be seen. Any option – including rescinding the sanctions – could make China look weak. However, Wu Xinbo, Fudan University professor and director at the Center for American Studies, told Fox News Digital via email from Shanghai that he has some doubts. ""These China hawks will surely push the envelope on the Taiwan question as hard as they can,"" said Wu, ""but it may backfire, and the U.S. will get burned. I'm not sure if this is what Trump wants."" So far, however, Trump seems to be sending clear signals that his administration will not be all bark and no bite. Rep. Michael Waltz, R-Fla., Trump’s choice for national security adviser, is at least as strident as Rubio. Writing in The Economist earlier this month, Waltz, opined that conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East need to be ""urgently"" ended, so the U.S. can ""finally focus strategy attention where it should be: countering the greater the threat from the Chinese Communist Party.""  Rep. Michael Waltz (R-Fla.) speaks during Day 1 of the Republican National Convention on July 15, 2024 in Milwaukee. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Trump has also nominated his loyal ally, New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-NY., to be his ambassador to the United Nations. Senior Adviser to the think-tank Foundation for the Defense of Democracies Richard Goldberg wrote that, aside from enthusiastically vetoing anti-Israel U.N. resolutions, he expects Stefanik to work toward ""leveraging American financial assistance across the U.N. system to root out Chinese malign influence…"" Rather predictably, netizens on China’s censored internet went with the ""who cares?"" line that has become common. Ross Darrell Feingold, a Taipei-based lawyer and rare American in Taiwan who is active on TouTiao, a Chinese social media platform, told Fox News Digital that the comments he received in response to the likely Rubio nomination included, ""Doesn't matter. All U.S. politicians are anti-China,"" and, ""No such thing as ‘anti-China, pro-Taiwan.’ There's only ‘anti-China’ and the U.S. isn't serious about being pro-Taiwan.""

Former first lady Melania Trump said she questions whether current first lady Jill Biden's ""concern was genuine"" following the first assassination attempt against President-elect Donald Trump in July, due to her rhetoric about her husband in the days leading up to the incident.  Trump, in an interview with French publication ""Paris Match"" last month, said that Biden ""took the initiative to contact me directly"" after ""someone tried to murder my husband in Pennsylvania"" during his rally on July 13. ""I do question, however, whether Jill’s concern was genuine as a few days prior she referred to my husband as ‘evil’ and a ‘liar,’"" Trump said.

Rick Scott, R-Fla., says he is committed to getting the president-elect's agenda passed on 'Hannity.' Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., was knocked out of the Senate leader race after the first secret ballot on Wednesday morning, during which none of the three candidates received a majority of the votes. Senate Minority Whip John Thune was ultimately elected as the new Republican Senate leader and the majority leader of the upper chamber in the new Congress after winning a second secret ballot. Sources told Fox News that Scott received the least number of votes during the first ballot. The senators advanced to a second secret ballot between only Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. Thune received the most votes on the first ballot with 23, but fell short of a majority, needing four more. Cornyn posted 15 votes, despite having only one public endorsement beforehand. Scott received 13 votes in the ballot before being knocked out of the race. The new Senate GOP leader was chosen on Wednesday.

16,General Politics,2024,11,"Trump, defying media predictions, mainly picks seasoned Capitol Hill veterans such as Marco Rubio",Howard Kurtz,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports the latest on the growing divide.  The media warned for months that Donald Trump would have ""no guardrails"" in a second term, and would probably hand out top positions to a bunch of right-wing crazies. Instead, he picked Marco Rubio yesterday as secretary of State, a 14-year Senate veteran and son of Cuban immigrants who has been informally advising him on foreign policy. MEDIA LIBERALS SAVAGE KAMALA AS TRUMP PICKS EXPERIENCED HARD-LINERS The president-elect has also tapped a number of Hill veterans who are conventional conservatives, agree with him on key issues and could just as easily have been named by Mitt Romney. Also yesterday, Trump selected Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor, as Homeland Security secretary, after she overcame the dog-shooting incident that knocked her out of the veepstakes. Trump has been rolling out these appointments at hyper-speed, just a week after the election. He has stayed off TV and hasn’t made any inflammatory posts. He’s trying to demonstrate a seriousness about governing, by hitting the ground running. In the past, presidents and presidents-elect have appeared on air, praising their nominee or maybe two, and yielding to a short, grateful speech by the chosen ones. But Trump appears to be skipping all that.  All the top jobs haven’t been filled, obviously, but even some top Democrats are praising the choice of Rubio (while some in the MAGA movement are disappointed). He’s unquestionably a hawk, and will be the face of American foreign policy as he travels around the world.  President-elect Donald Trump is pictured in front of the White House. (Getty Images/AP Images) Sure, he said some terrible things about Trump, who derided him as Little Marco, when both ran in 2016. I watched Rubio on the trail that year and he’s a very charismatic speaker. But the two have long since mended fences. Rubio tried to push immigration reform a decade ago as part of various Senate gangs, but has since distanced himself from the effort. I keep seeing television chyrons that, almost in accusatory fashion, say Trump is hiring ""loyalists."" Excuse me–do you think that Joe Biden, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton didn’t hire loyalists? Presidents want aides who generally agree with them and won’t turn into troublemakers. Biden hired such longtime advisers as Ron Klain, Mike Donilon and Steve Richetti. From a conservative point of view, when Biden hired top officials who wanted to strengthen environmental rules, boost labor unions and spend hundreds of billions of dollars to dig out of the pandemic, that was a hard-line departure from Trump 1.0. Now Trump will reverse many Biden policies with the stroke of a pen. DEPRESSED MEDIA REACT TO TRUMP VICTORY: HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY HAVE HAPPENED? The other picks so far: Upstate New York congresswoman Elise Stefanik, a member of the House leadership and impeachment defender, has been tapped for U.N. ambassador.  Trump also chose former Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. He’s a mainstream conservative who has crusaded against excessive environmental regulations and gotten a lifetime score of 14 percent from the League of Conservation Voters. He told Fox News that the administration will ""roll back regulations"" that are causing businesses to ""struggle"" and are ""forcing"" them to move overseas. After that, Trump tapped Florida GOP congressman Mike Waltz, a former Green Beret, as White House national security adviser, which doesn’t require Senate confirmation. He’s a China hawk and Ukraine skeptic. ""Stopping Russia before it draws NATO and therefore the U.S. into war is the right thing to do,"" Waltz wrote. ""But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass.""  Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., attends a campaign rally for former President Donald Trump at the Trump National Doral Golf Club on July 9, 2024 in Doral, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) These are serious people who know how Washington works. By the way, Trump has shrunk what’s expected to be a very small GOP edge in the House by picking two members. But in Rubio’s case, Gov. Ron DeSantis can appoint a replacement who would serve until the midterm elections. As I’m typing this, Trump just named Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate, as ambassador to Israel. Huckabee has led many delegations to the country and is staunchly pro-Israel.  And after I filed this, Trump named Bill McGinley, who worked on election integrity for the RNC and was general counsel for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as his White House counsel. And after I filed the insert, another announcement: John Ratcliffe being tapped for CIA director. The former Texas congressman, known for criticizing the FBI as biased against Trump, became his director of national intelligence in 2020.  Last night, Trump made his first hire from Fox News. Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and co-host of ""Fox & Friends Weekend,"" has been named Defense secretary. Trump noted that Hegseth did tours in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, was awarded two Bronze Stars, and just published the best-selling ""The War on Warriors."" Trump tried to get him confirmed the previous year, but Ratcliffe withdrew after GOP senators and ex-intel officials raised concerns about him, amid media disclosures that he’d embellished his prosecutorial efforts in immigration and terrorism cases. So he certainly qualifies as a highly partisan pick. The two appointees who can fairly be described as aggressive hard-liners–critics would say extremists–are Stephen Miller and Tom Homan–both hired to deal with Trump’s top priority, the border. Miller, who spearheaded immigration policy in the first Trump term, has been promoted to deputy chief of staff, and even that title doesn’t capture the clout he’ll have as a trusted member of the inner circle. He pushed the family separation policy that was extremely controversial. WHY THE MEDIA WAITED TILL NOW TO ADMIT HARRIS RAN A LOUSY CAMPAIGN Homan, who ran ICE in the first term, is being called the border czar. When asked if there was a way to avoid separating families, as happened last time, he said sure–deport them all together. He said at a conference over the summer: ""Washington Post can do all the stories they want on me about ‘Tom Homan’s deportin’ people, he’s really good at it!’ They ain’t seen s*** yet! Wait till 2025!"" Miller and Homan will be responsible for carrying out mass deportations of the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants living in America, or at least starting the process so the president-elect can say he kept his promise. Critics call the goal utterly unrealistic. Now there are others who will also enjoy huge influence. Elon Musk, who donated $119 million to help Trump, is now the most powerful private citizen ever–heading a waste commission, posting hundreds of messages on X, sitting in on Trump call to Volodymyr Zelenskyy – all while seeking billions in federal contracts. Trump said last night that Musk will head a Department of Government Efficiency - he promised to ""send shockwaves through the system"" - with help from former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy.  Tom Homan, former acting director of US Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE), speaks during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, US, on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. ( Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Images) RFK Jr. will get some title, but Trump has to decide whether to go along with his hotly disputed ideas on vaccines and removing fluoride from water systems. He’s also threatened to fire FDA officials who have waged a ""war on public health,"" saying the agency has suppressed such products as raw milk, ivermectin and vitamins. And of course J.D. Vance will be an unusually active vice president and heir apparent.   Still to come: the top jobs of Treasury secretary and the extraordinarily sensitive post of attorney general. I also want to know who’ll be press secretary! One reason we’re in for weeks and weeks of skeptical to negative coverage is that every beat reporter on the planet must now do obligatory pieces on Donald Trump. Whether they cover sports, religion, labor, housing, entertainment, courts, energy, television, schools or crime, they need to write about the impact of the 47th president–keeping in mind that he weighs in on everything.   From yesterday alone:  Washington Post: ""Trump Pledged to Close the Education Department. What would that mean?"" New York Times: ""Trump’s ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ Cuts Two Ways for Oil Companies."" And: ""Colleges Wonder if They Will Be ‘the Enemy’ Under Trump"" But my personal favorite: ""What a Trump Presidency Means for the Liquor Industry."" (Trump doesn’t drink, but every industry wants less regulation.) There’s also this Drudge headline: ""Wife Divorces Husband Over Vote."" As the Mirror reports, ""A man has said he can’t believe his wife was ready to ‘throw away our entire life’ after filing for divorce over his vote for Donald Trump.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The distraught husband wrote on social media that he has been left without words that the marriage could fall apart over politics.""

18,General Politics,2024,11,Media liberals savage Kamala as Trump picks experienced hard-liners,Howard Kurtz,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has updates on control of the U.S. House and the race for GOP Senate leader on 'The Story.' I have now read 587 pieces on why Kamala Harris got clobbered, so I consider myself an expert. I have also watched endless cable segments in which left-leaning pundits either grappled with the fallout from the Democratic wipeout, or urged their colleagues to become part of the Resistance, with Rachel Maddow telling the ""free press"" to ""stand and fight."" As Donald Trump moves quickly to fill top administration posts – and newspaper pieces warn of the horrors to come – the denigration of Harris, and Joe Biden, has reached fever pitch. And yet, many of the media liberals who praised the Kamala operation as ""flawless"" and ""incredible"" now basically say it was a no-good, horrible, very bad campaign. That makes clear they knew this all along, but wouldn’t say so, because they were protecting the vice president as a way of trying to keep Trump out of the White House. This is yet another blow to the media’s plummeting credibility. BIDEN, HARRIS TEAMS IN LEAK WAR AFTER KAMALA HARRIS' 2024 ELECTION LOSS President Biden, from left, Vice President Kamala Harris, Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough and Maj. Gen. Trevor Bredenkamp, commanding general of the Joint Task Force-National Capital Region and the U.S. Military District of Washington, stand during a wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on National Veterans Day Observance at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Va., Monday, Nov. 11, 2024.  (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Here are some of the media post-mortems: Andrew Sullivan: ""How could an entire left-liberal worldview be more comprehensibly dismantled by reality? And yet, the primary response among my own liberal friends was rage at the electorate. They texted me to insist that Harris lost because of white people — white women, in particular.""  Maureen Dowd: ""Some Democrats are finally waking up and realizing that woke is broke… ""Kamala, a Democratic lawmaker told me, made the ‘colossal mistake’ of running a billion-dollar campaign with celebrities like Beyoncé when many of the struggling working-class voters she wanted couldn’t even afford a ticket to a Beyoncé concert, much less a down payment on a home."" Nellie Bowles, the Free Press, said Harris ""made me furious, because she’s a good and fine person who ran a truly terrible campaign. It was a campaign that exemplified all of the delusions of the modern Democrats: that you never need to say what you stand for (because people should just assume you know what’s best for them), that you should never answer hard questions or appear with questionable figures, and that the only issue any American woman should care about is abortion… ""The real villain of this story is Zombie Biden and his corrupt family, who the media treated like heroes the whole way through."" David Brooks: ""There will be some on the left who will say Trump won because of the inherent racism, sexism and authoritarianism of the American people. Apparently, those people love losing and want to do it again and again and again… ""Can the party of the universities, the affluent suburbs and the hipster urban cores do this [disrupt the Republicans]? Well, Donald Trump hijacked a corporate party, which hardly seemed like a vehicle for proletarian revolt, and did exactly that. Those of us who condescend to Trump should feel humbled — he did something none of us could do."" Politico: ""How can Harris’s defenders grumble about being dragged down by Biden when she could not find one substantive policy issue on which to break from the unpopular incumbent? She waited three months, blurted out on ‘The View’ that she couldn’t think of any difference with Biden.""  National Review: ""She was a lousy candidate with an even lousier message, if you can call it that. The only thing she had to do was sell herself, and she couldn’t manage even this fundamental task."" COLUMNIST CALLS OUT KAMALA HARRIS FOR NOT BEING ABLE TO ANSWER CRITICAL QUESTION ON ‘THE VIEW’ Well, you get the idea. In a 107-day campaign, Harris couldn’t convince enough Americans that she was authentic, that she could be commander-in-chief, or that she had abandoned the far-left policies (such as legalizing border crossings and backing inmate trans surgeries) of her last campaign. She foolishly hid from the press for a month, fostering the impression that she couldn’t go off script. Now just about everyone – except those blaming her loss on racism and sexism – is saying what I’ve been saying for three months. Harris never should have picked Tim Walz, who did nothing for the ticket. The trans issue hurt her and she never picked an issue, that or something else, to separate from the left wing of her party. She worried too much about hurting Joe’s feelings. The VP tried to focus on kitchen-table economics, such as with her price-gouging plan. But despite low inflation and unemployment right now, many Americans still felt they were paying higher grocery prices and liked Trump’s economic record better than Biden’s. Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is comforted by second gentleman Doug Emhoff, as Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks, conceding 2024 U.S. presidential election to President-elect Donald Trump, at Howard University in Washington on November 6, 2024.  (REUTERS/Mike Blake) It may well be there’s nothing Harris could have done to stop the Trump juggernaut, given his hijacking of working class and minority voters. Now the president-elect is moving quickly to tap his top appointees, having immediately named campaign manager Susie Wiles as his chief of staff – the first woman ever to hold the job. Tom Homan, who was ICE director in Trump’s first term, will be the border czar, not a big surprise. Homan will be in charge of the mass deportation program, and when asked if there was a way to avoid separating families, as happened last time, he said sure – deport them all together. Stephen Miller, who ran the hard-line immigration policy in the first term, is expected to be named deputy chief of staff – a promotion, first reported yesterday by CNN, that probably doesn’t convey the clout he’ll have as a trusted member of Trump’s inner circle. TRUMP WILL LEAVE THE WH WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST APPROVAL RATINGS OF ANY MODERN PRESIDENT, LARA TRUMP PREDICTS I had been told days ago that Elise Stefanik, a GOP congresswoman from upstate New York, would go into the administration. And yesterday, Trump tapped her to be U.N. ambassador. She has experience in the George W. Bush White House. Then there are insiders who are the subject of speculation. Howard  Lutnick, a Wall Street CEO, is being touted by some as a possible Treasury secretary, but has his hands full as a co-chair of the transition.

Late yesterday, Trump chose former Long Island congressman Lee Zeldin to run the EPA. He’s a mainstream conservative who has crusaded against excessive environmental regulations and gotten a lifetime score of 14% from the League of Conservation Voters. The choice of Zeldin was first reported by the New York Post, and he told Fox News that the administration will ""roll back regulations"" that are causing businesses to ""struggle"" and are ""forcing"" them to move overseas. After that, he tapped Florida GOP congressman Mike Waltz as White House national security adviser, which doesn’t require Senate confirmation. As the Wall Street Journal first reported, he’s a China hawk and Ukraine skeptic. ""Stopping Russia before it draws NATO and therefore the U.S. into war is the right thing to do,"" Waltz wrote. ""But the burden cannot continue to be solely on the shoulders of the American people, especially while Western Europe gets a pass."" (Trump has now reduced by two the House Republicans’ expected small margin.) Oh, and Politico says some Dems are already jockeying for 2028 (Josh Shapiro and Gavin Newsom) or being talked about (Pete Buttigieg and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear). Already? Can’t we get a break?  So my takeaway is that for all the media chatter about a lack of guardrails, Trump is so far picking serious people with serious experience. (Wiles hasn’t worked in Washington since the Reagan years, but her role is different.) They are, of course, also loyalists who will do his bidding.  Then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks during a campaign event, Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024, in Mint Hill, N.C. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) RFK Jr. will get a big title, but it’s not clear whether Trump will follow his far-out advice on vaccines and fluoride. And Elon Musk will be in charge of just about everything, and the world’s richest man has deluged X with hundreds of pro-Trump posts (and some high-profile liberals are bailing). But the most striking moment was Trump’s post saying Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo would not be joining the administration – not that anyone was expecting they would be. In his posting, the president-elect said he enjoyed working with both of them and thanked them for their service. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP My reaction was: Did somebody steal Trump’s phone? The words idiot and moron did not appear. Maybe this is a new tone from an incoming president who finally feels vindicated. We’ll see how long it lasts.

OpenAI has assembled a ""blueprint"" for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure that the company hopes will be considered by the incoming Trump administration and Congress – suggesting that the plan will help the United States maintain its lead in the field over competitors like China. The company’s Vice President of Global Affairs, Chris Lehane, announced the ""Infrastructure Blueprint for the U.S."" on Wednesday during an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).  The company says AI's potential presents an ""unmissable opportunity to revitalize the American Dream and reindustrialize the US."" ""Investments to extend the current U.S. lead in AI will yield tens of thousands of skilled-trade and other jobs, growth in productivity and GDP; a modernized grid including power generated by nuclear energy; a state-of-the-art network of semiconductor manufacturing facilities; and a new generation of AI-powered businesses and entrepreneurship,"" OpenAI claims. PETITION CALLS FOR TRUMP ADMIN TO APPOINT MUSK AS AI ADVISER In this photo illustration, the OpenAI logo is seen displayed on a mobile phone screen with ChatGPT logo in the background. (Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The company, led by Sam Altman, also estimates that U.S.-backed projects abroad will help attract $175 billion currently sitting in global funds. They purport that these potential investments are a beneficial alternative to China-backed projects—characterizing the East Asian country's endeavors as a means to limit citizen access to AI, tighten government control over the populace and strengthen global influence. ""We need a national strategy now to ensure that investment in AI infrastructure benefits and protects American competitiveness, our national security and that of our allies,"" the company said in its blueprint release. ""This strategy should encourage rather than stifle developers, who will be the Main Street businesses of the Intelligence Age. It should support thriving AI ecosystems of labs, start-ups and larger companies that together will secure America's leadership role on AI into the future.""  OpenAI listed a set of five initiatives to catalyze the building of AI infrastructure in the U.S. and with allies across the world. 1) AI economic zones: The company is urging state and federal governments to give states incentives that speed up the permitting and approval of AI infrastructure –thereby making it easier to complete new solar arrays, wind farms and bring nuclear reactors back online. OpenAI said states providing subsidies could include a clause that ensures a portion of the compute is made available to public universities.

(Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg via Getty Images / Getty Images) 2) National Transmission Highway Act: OpenAI is pushing for a program that would give funding to stand-up transmission infrastructure for AI, including electrical power on an AI-optimized transmission grid, high-bandwidth data communications, and pipelines for other energy sources needed to power a nationwide ""AI highway."" 3) Government backstops for high-value AI public works: Open AI believes the U.S. government can encourage the private sector to fund high-cost energy infrastructure projects. The government would then commit to purchasing energy and other means that lower credit risk. Furthermore, the government could direct funding to local training programs that prepare Americans for AI jobs, such as data center management and operations. OpenAI says existing state-sponsored 529 educational savings accounts 
could also be altered to allow investments in coding boot camps, HVAC technician training and electrical training. 4) A North American Compact for AI: The company suggests a pact among countries in the Western Hemisphere to streamline access to capital, supply chains and talent. They believe that eventually, as it expands, the sharing of resources and information could easily compete with the People's Republic of China's AI infrastructure alliances. AI-POWERED ATTACK DRONES TAKE FLIGHT 5) Tapping the expertise of the US nuclear Navy: OpenAI is pushing the government to utilize the Navy, which operates approximately 100 Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) to power naval submarines. In their blueprint, the Navy could offer their expertise to construct civilian SMR's and ""catalyze a revival of the American nuclear power that helps drive our great reindustrialization."" ""AI presents an unmissable opportunity to reindustrialize the U.S. and, through that, generate the kind of broad-based economic growth that will revitalize the American Dream. It also presents a national security imperative to protect our nation and our allies against a surging China by offering an AI shaped by democratic values, promoting individual choice and benefiting the most people possible,"" OpenAI said. OpenAI believes the incoming Trump administration should consider their ideas for the future of AI infrastructure.  (Getty Images) Leaders in both the House and Senate have emphasized that getting lawmakers up to speed on AI is a priority for Congress. However, they've diverged somewhat on what that means. Still, people close to the growing AI sector say they are frustrated with the pace Congress is handling the technology. In July, Congress passed a bipartisan act to mitigate financial and regulatory challenges impeding nuclear energy development. According to Pew, a majority of Americans favor an increase in nuclear plants to generate electricity. TRUMP'S FIRST CABINET PICKS DECIDEDLY NOT ISOLATIONISTS: UKRAINE, ISRAEL BREATHE A SIGN OF RELIEF Still, the shutdown of nuclear reactors continues to outpace new construction. President-elect Donald Trump took a skeptical stance on nuclear energy in his interview with podcaster Joe Rogan leading up to the election. ""There’s a little danger to nuclear,"" he said.

23,General Politics,2024,11,Trump thanks Biden for 'smooth transition' during White House meeting,Brooke Singman,"President-elect Donald Trump met with President Biden in the Oval Office on Wednesday, vowing a 'smooth transition' of power between the administrations. WASHINGTON - President-elect Trump and President Biden both pledged a smooth transition between administrations, as they met at the White House on Wednesday morning.  ""I look forward…to having a smooth transition. We'll do everything we can to make sure you're accommodated, what you need,"" President Biden said as cameras and reporters were briefly allowed in the Oval Office for the meeting. Speaking second, Trump emphasized that ""politics is tough and in many cases it’s not a very nice world, but it is a nice world today. ""I appreciate very much the transition that's so smooth. It will be as smooth as it can get, and I very much appreciate that, the former and future president added. LOYALTY MATTERS: TRUMP PICKS ALLIES AND SUPPORTERS TO FILL OUT HIS SECOND ADMINISTRATION President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) Trump returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue just over a week after his sweeping election victory, as he made his first stop back at the White House in nearly four years. He arrived at the White House at the invitation of Biden, the politician he knocked out of the 2024 presidential race. For Biden - who ended his own re-election bid in July, a month after his disastrous debate performance against Trump reignited questions over whether the 81-year-old president was physically and mentally up for another four years in the White House and sparked calls for him to drop out of the race - the meeting with his predecessor and now successor was likely awkward. HERE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 Trump spent years verbally eviscerating Biden and his performance in the White House. And even after Biden ended his re-election bid, Trump continued to slam the president and his successor atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket - Vice President Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) And Biden, for a couple of years, has labeled Trump a threat to the nation's democracy. But Biden, a traditionalist, wants to ensure a smooth transition between administrations. Biden's offer to Trump to visit the White House was an invitation he himself was never accorded. Four years ago, in the wake of his election defeat at the hands of Biden, Trump refused to concede and tried unsuccessfully to overturn the results. VANCE IS THE FRONT-RUNNER, BUT HERE'S WHO ELSE MAY RUN FOR THE 2028 GOP PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION Breaking with longstanding tradition, Trump didn't invite Biden to the White House. And two weeks after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters aiming to upend congressional certification of Biden's Electoral College victory, Trump left Washington ahead of the presidential inauguration of his successor, becoming the first sitting president in a century and a half to skip out on a successor's inauguration. According to sources, incoming White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles and current White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients were in attendance on Wednesday as Trump and Biden met behind closed doors. ""President Biden's decision to welcome President-elect Trump to the White House is a tribute to normalcy in the presidential transition process. What was denied to Joe Biden following his election, is being restored to Biden's credit,"" veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance told Fox News. President Joe Biden meets with President-elect Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Nov. 13, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP) Lesperance, the president of New Hampshire-based New England College, called the invitation by Biden "" a remarkable gesture in that it legitimizes Trump's return to power by the nation's leading Democrat and, hopefully, will be met with a commitment to orderly transitions in the future."" The meeting will be the first between Biden and Trump since they faced off on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia, in their one and only debate. The two presidents - along with Harris and Trump's running mate and now vice president-elect, Sen. JD Vance - stood next to each other on Sept. 11 in New York City's Lower Manhattan, at ceremonies for the 23rd anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This was Trump's second meeting at the White House with a departing president. Eight years ago, after defeating Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump sat down at the White House with President Barack Obama, who was finishing up his second term steering the nation. ""We now are going to want to do everything we can to help you succeed. Because, if you succeed, then the country succeeds,"" Obama told Trump at the time. While a tradition, the meeting between the incoming and outgoing presidents is not mandated.

24,Congress,2024,11,John Thune snags 2 more endorsements in competitive GOP leader race to succeed McConnell,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on when the Senate plans to vote for the GOP majority leader on ’Your World.’ FIRST ON FOX: Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., gained two endorsements in the Senate Republican leader race, as both North Dakota Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven threw their support behind him. Cramer will be voting for Thune in the first secret ballot on Wednesday morning. ""I told both Rick Scott and John Cornyn today that I'll be casting my first vote for John Thune,"" the North Dakota senator said in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.  Thune is competing against Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla., to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., as Republican leader in the upper chamber. McConnell is the longest-serving party leader in Senate history.  ""Thune has never lied to me,"" Cramer said of the leader candidate. ""I can't say that of everybody.""  Despite this comment, he maintained he has no ""enemies"" within the conference, which he said is a ""good group."" TRUMP ALLIES BACK RICK SCOTT IN GOP SENATE LEADER RACE AS THEY LOOK TO INFLUENCE SECRET BALLOT Kevin Cramer is the latest Republican to publicly endorse Thune. (Reuters) He said making an endorsement was ""the way to do it,"" in his opinion. ""There's 53 of us. We all sought these positions of influence and, you know, appearing neutral seems sort of cowardice, if you will."" As his reasoning for supporting Thune, the senator explained their long history, both coming from a Dakota. ""I've known John Thune since we were children, basically,"" he said, referencing the 1990 election cycle in both North and South Dakota when they were Republican Party directors.

(Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""All four of us from the Dakotas, of course, are supporting him,"" he added. Thune and Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., are publicly backing the former, but Hoeven hadn't previously made a public endorsement.  Hoeven's office confirmed on Monday to Fox News Digital that he is backing Thune. ""I mean, John and I have a long personal relationship. He's a good friend. He is from the neighborhood,"" Cramer said.  According to the North Dakota Republican, he thinks the leader race will need to go to a second secret ballot, as one candidate must reach 27 votes in order to win.  SENATE LEADER CONTENDER JOHN THUNE RESPONDS TO NEW TRUMP LITMUS TEST AHEAD OF ELECTION Senators John Thune, John Cornyn, and Rick Scott are contenders in the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as leader. (Getty Images) As for the high-profile endorsements of Scott coming from external figures frequently aligned with President-Elect Donald Trump, Cramer said, ""Everybody has an opinion. I mean, I have people in my own party in North Dakota that would like me to do one thing or another."" But, he stressed that the Republican conference as a whole is in line with Trump. ""I endorsed Donald Trump and Donald Trump endorsed me,"" the senator said.  ""[W]hen it comes to the—literally the issue of governing, we're all on the same team. The Republican majority in the Senate to a T is in sync with Donald Trump's agenda.""

25,Congress,2024,8,Speaker Mike Johnson: Only Americans should decide our elections. Here’s how Congress can guarantee it,Rep. Mike Johnson,"Speaker Mike Johnson and Rep. Darrell Issa took an impromptu trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on Thursday. This clip was shared by Johnson's official X account after his trip. Credit: Speaker Mike Johnson via X. There are few things more important to our country than ensuring the integrity of our elections. The people rightfully demand it, and Congress has a duty to act.   Yet, when given the opportunity to eliminate one of the most glaring threats to fair elections, 198 House Democrats voted instead to keep the door open to fraud.  The threat is very real. In nearly all 50 states today — including every major electoral battleground state — a noncitizen can walk into a DMV or welfare office, fill out a federal voter registration form, claim they are a U.S. citizen, and be registered to vote.  That noncitizen can then cast a ballot and help decide the direction of America.  REPUBLICANS SAY SCHUMER MUST ACT ON VOTER PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP BILL IF DEMOCRAT 'REALLY CARES ABOUT DEMOCRACY' This is not a hypothetical problem. I was recently in San Diego, CA to tour the new epicenter of the Biden-Harris border catastrophe where brave, overworked Customs and Border Protection agents have encountered millions of illegals. The agents told me the Biden-Harris Executive Order isn’t working the way the administration says it is. In some ways, it’s made the crisis worse.   Noncitizen voting jeopardizes the rights of all Americans. FILE: 'Vote Here' sign is seen at a voting precinct.  (REUTERS/Emily Elconin) Instead of carrying out their mission of protecting our borders, they have become processing agents, forced by the administration to send illegals throughout the country with little paperwork or record of their location. Many of them end up at local DMVs.   While it is illegal and clearly wrong for a noncitizen to vote in a federal election, and thus engage in foreign election interference, a current loophole in the National Voter Registration Act actually prevents states from requesting proof of citizenship when the registration form is signed.    To close that dangerous loophole and help ensure that only Americans decide American elections, House Republicans drafted and passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act.   Our legislation makes several critically important reforms. It requires state election officials to request proof of citizenship for every person registering to vote and gives the state officials easy access to federal databases so they can confirm citizenship status.  The SAVE Act also requires those state officials to clean up their voter rolls and directs the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to determine whether to conduct removal proceedings of any illegal alien who has registered unlawfully.  To ensure actual citizens can continue to easily register to vote, the bill allows state officials to accept a wide variety of documents for registrants to prove citizenship and requires states to establish an alternative process for Americans who have misplaced their documentation.   Finally, the SAVE Act requires DHS to notify a state chief election official whenever an individual has been naturalized to ensure our newest citizens can exercise their right to vote.  These commonsense provisions are not only right, but they are also in high demand. Polling has shown that 89% of Americans believe only Americans should decide elections — including 82% of Democrats, 80% of Black voters, and 78% of Hispanic voters.  In light of all this, one would expect overwhelmingly bipartisan support for the SAVE Act in Congress. But Democrat leaders put on a full-court press to discourage their members from supporting our bill, and the White House issued a veto threat.  The Democrats’ opposition to this simple election integrity bill is indefensible and exposes their intention to allow illegal aliens to vote.   CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Earlier this year, most of these same Democrats voted to count illegal aliens in the 2030 Census. They also voted to let noncitizens vote in local elections in Washington, D.C. Some may also remember, how, in 2019, then-presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris relied on a study that touted the ""electoral implications"" of widespread amnesty, including ""sizable contributions to the margin of victory in swing states."" Perhaps that’s why Border Czar Harris has done such a pitiful job securing the border.  Those who have illegally entered our country have no regard for our laws and have no right to interfere in our lawful election processes. Virtually all Americans agree — except for the Biden-Harris administration and congressional Democrats, who are so desperate to hang on to power that they will sacrifice the integrity of our election system.    While it is illegal and clearly wrong for a noncitizen to vote in a federal election, and thus engage in foreign election interference, a current loophole in the National Voter Registration Act actually prevents states from requesting proof of citizenship when the registration form is signed.    In a study of the 2008 election, researchers estimated that 6.4% of noncitizens in the U.S. had voted in the general election. If a similar portion of the 7.2 million illegal aliens Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have welcomed into the country were to vote this year, those 460,800 votes would be more than enough to change the election outcome in a few key battleground states.   CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In an era of divided government where every single ballot matters immensely, we must have zero tolerance for fraud. One of our Republican colleagues won her first race in 2020 by only six votes. And for many weeks during this Congress, our majority in the House was held by just a one vote margin.   As the sanctity of our elections now hangs in the balance, the SAVE Act is urgently needed. It is smart policy and overwhelmingly supported by the American people. Everyone who shares this common concern should insist that Senator Schumer bring this bill forward to pass in the Senate, and that President Biden then sign it into law. The stakes could not be any higher.  Republican Mike Johnson is the 56th speaker of the United States House of Representatives and represents Louisiana's 4th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

26,Congress,2024,10,Hard-line GOP effort to decentralize Senate leader authority dashed by McConnell ally,Julia Johnson,"Fox News' Brooke Taylor reports on the tight Senate race in Texas between Sen. Ted Cruz and Democrat opponent Colin Allred on ‘Special Report.’ As Senate Republicans approach their first competitive leader election in decades to pick a replacement for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., forces in the conference are pushing dueling pathways for the party as hard-liners hope to decentralize the leader's authority in backing ""Democrat priorities."" ""To avoid the gridlock of business as usual, it is imperative that we structure the Senate in a way that gives individual senators real legislative power, not just lip service,"" wrote Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in an op-ed for Fox News this week.  Lee, who is chair of the Senate Republican Steering Committee, said that if former President Trump gets elected next month, there is limited time to pass his agenda with an expected slim majority in the Senate and potentially in the House as well.  MIKE LEE: THE UNNOTICED ELECTION THAT COULD DETERMINE THE FUTURE Senators are divided over how to proceed and whether to reform the GOP conference before the leader election; from left are Sen. Mike Lee, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Thom Tillis. (Reuters) Running to succeed McConnell are Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sens. John Cornyn, R-Texas, and Rick Scott, R-Fla. For Scott, democratizing the conference has been the guiding principle of his leadership campaign.  Both Thune and Cornyn have expressed openness to changes, and in fact, Cornyn threw his support behind a push for term limits for the Republican leader.  ""Moderates will be tempted to join Democrats to pass funding bills that tie Trump’s hands,"" Lee warned of Congress under a potential second Trump presidency.  The Utah Republican is among a cohort of senators that has pushed to democratize the Senate GOP conference and decentralize power from the leader, in particular.  Lee outlined specific requests of a potential Republican leader, which included nixing restrictions on individual senators' ability to offer amendments, allowing significantly longer periods to debate legislation, and requiring broad conference support to ""whip"" in favor of bills or nominees.  'DESPICABLE HUMAN BEING': MCCONNELL'S 2020 THOUGHTS ON 'SLEAZEBALL' TRUMP REVEALED IN NEW BOOK Lee has been vocal about wanting change in the conference. (Tierney L. Cross/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""This would protect Republican leadership from ever being in the position of having to whip for legislation advancing Democrat priorities,"" he recently wrote in a conference-wide letter.  While some members of the conference, frustrated with its direction under McConnell, have similarly advocated for such a plan, others have pushed back.  An ally of the minority leader, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., sent his own letter to the conference just after Lee, writing, ""It may be true that many Americans would be shocked to know that members may not be able to offer amendments."" But, he said, ""I suspect many Americans would also be shocked to know that any one member can grind the legislative process to a halt while attempting to advance an amendment that a supermajority of our conference is against.""  On several occasions, members such as Lee and those in agreement with him have disrupted the amendment process advanced by the conference, able to do so by denying unanimous consent. The Senate is often referred to as running on the unanimous consent of members because the upper chamber can very easily be upended by one senator unwilling to allow processes to move forward.  A similar criticism of these senators was offered by a former Republican leadership aide, who said, ""Often it is the same cohort of individuals who are decrying the centralization of power that do everything – not with the intention of yielding that result – but all of their behaviors drive the decision-making into the leader's office at the 11th and a half hour."" HARRIS BARNSTORMS WISCONSIN IN 1-DAY SWING STATE TOUR TARGETING YOUNG VOTERS Tillis is an ally of McConnell. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) According to the former aide, the ultimate increase in power of leaders is the result of years and years of ""institutional pressures.""  ""This was a long slide into the marginalization of rank-and-file senators in favor of leadership."" In fact, they said, no matter who is elected as the next leader, they cannot decentralize power and democratize the GOP conference on their own.  Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, former top spokesperson to former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and former chief of staff of the Senate Republican Conference, said that ""Senator Tillis is acting as a proxy for McConnell"" who isn't publicly discussing changes to the conference but is passionately arguing against certain reforms in closed-door meetings.  According to a Republican source familiar, ""Tillis is running McConnell's ground game"" when it comes to preserving the conference's norms and guardrails.  In his initial letter, Lee told colleagues the leader election is ""a once-in-a-generation opportunity"" to ""lower the temperature of our politics and restore public trust in our institutions."" Tillis specifically opposed negotiating reforms as part of the race, writing, ""I believe we need to elect a new leader first, rather than negotiate terms with the Republican leader candidates before the vote."" STRIKING BOEING WORKERS BOO AFTER DEMOCRATIC SEN MARIA CANTWELL CRITICIZES TRUMP From left: Sens. John Cornyn, John Thune and Rick Scott are contenders in the race to succeed Mitch McConnell as leader. (Getty Images) The North Carolina Republican concluded, ""I know Mike’s concerns about the voices of some members being silenced are sincere, but I believe his proposals to address these concerns are ill-advised."" The former GOP leadership aide pointed to the House of Representatives, suggesting Republicans are looking ""at what's happening in the House with a leader, the speaker in this case, who's been politically weakened by conference rules."" They said senators are seeing ""the chaos that episodically prevails"" in the House and are asking, ""Is this really what we want in the Senate?""  According to Bonjean, this feud ""helps to muddy the waters for Thune and Cornyn"" in their leader bids.  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""What will be interesting to watch is the barometer of how many senators that will actually back up Sen. Lee’s trial balloon,"" he added.  Lee's ideas for the conference come as he and others have been left particularly unhappy with the relatively frequent late-night and last-minute spending packages, supplemental aid bills and re-authorization measures that have included what he considers to be Democrat priorities.

Businessman Eric Hovde won the Republican nomination for Senate in Wisconsin on Tuesday, setting up a competitive general election between himself and Democrat incumbent Sen. Tammy Baldwin.  Hovde was endorsed by former President Trump in his primary race and has already spent a seven-figure sum on his campaign.  He defeated lesser-known challengers Charles Barman and Rejani Raveendran handily in the matchup.

Hovde recently spoke at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, where he slammed Baldwin as a ""rubber stamp"" for President Biden, citing her record of almost always voting in line with him.

29,Congress,2024,9,Dems look to force votes on emergency abortion as abortion pill deaths make headlines,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the vice president's efforts to highlight the death of a Georgia woman who took an abortion pill on 'Special Report.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., Senate President Pro tempore Patty Murray, D-Wash., and others revealed on Tuesday their plans to force votes on abortion-related bills in the wake of two pregnant women's deaths after taking abortion pills. In floor remarks, Schumer said, ""What happened in Georgia is a direct example of how abortion bans continue to exacerbate the racial disparities in maternal death. Amber’s doctors didn’t perform the medical procedures they knew she needed because of Georgia’s law."" ""It was the law overruling their good medical judgment. She went into septic shock and her heart stopped – all while doctors did everything except the medically-sound treatment she needed,"" he said, in reference to ProPublica's reporting on the deaths of Candi Miller and Amber Nicole Thurman.  JOHN CORNYN FLEXES FUNDRAISING CHOPS AS BATTLE TO SUCCEED MITCH MCCONNELL RAMPS UP Senate Democrats will look to hold a vote on a bill to codify Roe v. Wade on Wednesday. (Getty Images) Both of the women died in Georgia after taking abortion pills and suffering complications. In Thurman's case, according to ProPublica, doctors waited a prolonged period of time before performing the necessary dilation and curettage (D&C) procedure, which is not an abortion. Miller was found unresponsive by her family after suffering from the pill's complication.  ""Today, as you heard from the leader, we're going to try and pass this resolution, and we're going to see if the Senate can come together with one voice and tell women, ‘Women, we want to put your health first,'"" Murray said at a press conference.  The Washington Democrat attempted on Tuesday afternoon to advance her resolution to affirm ""the basic right to emergency health care, including abortion care"" for a vote by unanimous consent. However, it was objected to by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) The Democrats' attempts to force votes votes on abortion items came in response to the deaths of Miller and Thurman, which have caused a dispute over what is to blame.  ""Amber Thurman and Candi Miller are two Black mothers who lost their lives in Georgia due to the state's draconian abortion ban. Women who could have survived if they had been able to get the health care they needed. These are the consequences of Trump abortion bans,"" Murray claimed earlier this month.  Roe v. Wade was overturned in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision in 2022, which turned the authority to determine limitations on abortion back to the states. Former President Trump's appointment of Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett is largely credited for giving conservative justices the majority and pushing the decision over the edge.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Other Democrats have echoed Murray's sentiment, including Vice President Kamala Harris, blaming the overturn of Roe v. Wade for the women's deaths.  Some conservative leaders and groups have pushed back on Democrats' characterization of the women's deaths, including top pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America.  SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said in a statement, ""Pro-life laws are clear, yet politicians and the media are sowing confusion at women’s expense. Across the nation, pro-life laws allow doctors to provide emergency care, and doctors who fail to provide necessary medical care should be held accountable."" ""Pro-abortion Democrats and the abortion industry fearmonger and exploit tragedies resulting from abortions themselves, like the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller – leaving women confused about the law and scared to get care in emergency situations. These lies have real consequences, and we urge pro-abortion Democrats to value women’s safety over limitless abortion,"" she said.

30,Congress,2024,11,Rick Scott gains new Senate endorsements out of candidate forum on eve of leader election,Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on the president-elect's appointments on 'Your World.' Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., earned two more endorsements following what Republican senators described as a wide-ranging discussion with the three candidates to succeed outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. According to Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, who held the leader candidate forum, the issues that Scott, Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, were asked about included those that were procedural, substantive and policy-related — such as the debt deficit and illegal immigration. The senators were also prompted on how closely they would work with President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Lee, who endorsed Scott before even exiting the meeting, said that the Florida senator is ""a little more aligned with the president's agenda."" JOHN THUNE SNAGS 2 MORE ENDORSEMENTS IN COMPETITIVE GOP LEADER RACE TO SUCCEED MCCONNELL Scott has received an influx of public endorsements. (Alex Wong) And while he doesn’t think Thune or Cornyn would ""deliberately"" seek to cause friction with Trump, he noted that ""past can be prologue in some ways."" Lee's comment was presumably in reference to Thune's once-fractured relationship with Trump, which he has since worked to repair.  Thune left the forum expressing satisfaction with the discussion, telling reporters there were ""lots of good questions."" When asked if he had a sense of the level of support behind him, the South Dakota Republican said, ""you never know until the voters vote.""

Another Scott-endorser, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who was the first to back him last week, was particularly pleased with the meeting.

But not everyone was impressed by the Florida Republican. ""Scott’s remarks didn’t do much to impress or sway members,"" one source with knowledge told Fox News Digital. ""He focused more on his time as a businessman instead of priorities for the Senate."" A Thune endorser, Sen.

The Fox News Decision Desk projected that Republicans will take back control of the Senate in 2025 once the 119th Congress is sworn in. The GOP officially won enough Senate seats in the 2024 elections to take the majority back from the Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has led the upper chamber since 2021.  Republicans had a significantly more favorable map in terms of which Senate seats were up for election this cycle than the Democrats.

Joe Manchin, I-W.Va. With a West Virginia win and retaining all incumbents who were up for re-election, the GOP would be at 50 members already.  Democrats were in a much more difficult position, expected to lose Manchin's seat and having to fight a tight battle for outgoing Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema's Arizona Senate seat.

The party could not afford to lose practically any races in the 2024 elections, given their many vulnerabilities.  What made the 2024 elections even more difficult for Democrats to hang onto the majority was the sharp decrease in split-ticket voting. In several states, the races were very likely to be decided by the winner of the presidential race, as voters were expected to pick one party and vote for candidates in that column down the ballot.

55,Congress,2024,11,Dem Rep Ruben Gallego beats Kari Lake in battle for Arizona Senate seat,Julia Johnson,"The Associated Press projects Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., will defeat Trump-backed Kari Lake in the state's Senate race. Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., has won the race for Arizona's open Senate seat, beating out Republican Kari Lake, a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, according to The Associated Press Monday night. This was the final Senate race to be called, leaving the Republicans with a 53-47 majority. It’s still not clear which party will secure a House majority with a handful of races yet to be called there. Gallego has served in the House of Representatives since 2015, representing the 7th and 3rd congressional districts in Arizona.  ARIZONA DEMOCRATIC PARTY OFFICE SHARED WITH HARRIS-WALZ CAMPAIGN SHOT AT FOR THIRD TIME IN LESS THAN A MONTH Kari Lake and Rep. Ruben Gallego competed for the open Senate seat in Arizona. (Reuters) Lake ran unsuccessfully for Arizona governor in 2022 and was defeated by Gov. Katie Hobbs, D-Ariz. Prior to her gubernatorial run, she was a news anchor for a local Arizona television station and worked in the media for 27 years.  After the 2022 loss, she challenged the results, citing fraud concerns in the state. Lake still contends that there were significant irregularities in 2020 and 2022, echoing claims that Trump and many of his supporters have made. The concerns have led to the Republican National Committee devoting significant resources to election integrity efforts.

Cartwright was first sworn into Congress in 2013, where he represented Pennsylvania’s 17th District before the state redistricted in 2018 and Cartwright was elected to represent the 8th District.  The 8th Congressional District is located in Pennsylvania’s northeastern region and includes cities such as Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, encompassing Wayne, Pike and Lackawanna counties as well as portions of Luzerne and Monroe counties.  Cartwright’s re-election campaign was closely watched because he represents one of just nine districts across the country where Democrats worked to defend their seats after former President Trump won the districts in the 2020 presidential election.

In March 2021, Biden signed Promoting Access to Voting, which states that ""executive departments and agencies should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information."" The plan has already come under scrutiny from Senate Republicans, who have called it a federal ""voter mobilization"" effort with ""potentially partisan impacts.""

Steve Daines tells Fox News Digital the GOP's in a 'strong position' to flip the Democrat-held Senate seat in Montana. Senate Republicans have a feeling that the battle to succeed Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is just beginning and that more contenders will make last-minute bids for the role after the general election in November.  One name that continues to be tossed around is that of Steve Daines, R-Mont., head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), who has notably refused to rule out the possibility of running for the top Senate GOP role.  A source with knowledge told Fox News Digital that earlier in the year, after McConnell's shock February announcement that he would not seek another term as leader, former President Trump shared with allies that he would like to see Daines run for the position.  The two get along well, which spurred Trump's desire to see the Montana Republican join the race, the source said.

70,Congress,2024,9,"Dems face tight timeline to confirm Biden-Harris judges, surpass Trump legacy",Julia Johnson,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on the administration's Israel strategy on 'Special Report.' President Biden and Senate Democrats are racing to confirm more judicial nominees than former President Donald Trump did while in office.  However, they face a difficult schedule to get it done, with several time-sensitive pieces of legislation due this fall and an entire month out of session in October.  Prior to the August break, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., announced that seven nominees had been advanced out of committee to be considered for confirmation. It's unclear when these votes will take place once the Senate is back.  MCCORMICK SAYS 'PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING' IMPORTANCE OF 2024 ELECTION AS PENNSYLVANIA SENATE POLLS TIGHTEN Democrats face significant time constraints in the Biden effort to appoint more judges than Trump. (Reuters) A spokesperson for Durbin told Fox News Digital in a statement, ""Senate Democrats are in a strong position to confirm additional Biden-Harris judicial nominees through the rest of the year. Chair Durbin will continue holding nominations hearings and markups through the end of the Congress, as well as push for floor votes on these highly qualified, diverse nominees who are bringing balance to the federal judiciary."" So far, Biden has appointed 205 federal judges in his term, compared to the 204 whom Trump had appointed, as of Sept. 5, 2020, according to the Heritage Foundation's judicial tracker.  Both Biden and Trump have put a renewed emphasis on the federal judiciary, each focusing on quickly facilitating as many appointments as they could during their terms. Their appointments during one term have rivaled those of their predecessors, who had double the time to confirm them.  POLITICAL HANDICAPPER SHIFTS MONTANA SENATE TO ‘LEANS REPUBLICAN’ AS TESTER FALLS BEHIND Biden hit the 200 appointments milestone in May.  (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) Trump was particularly successful at appointing more judges to influential appellate court positions. In fact, Trump appointed nearly the same number of such judges in his sole term as former President Barack Obama did in both of his.  In May, Biden's White House had officially outpaced Trump at the same time in his term, appointing 200 federal judges. ""Judges matter. These men and women have the power to uphold basic rights or to roll them back,"" he said in a statement at the time, emphasizing his commitment to judicial appointments.  While Biden was ahead of Trump in the key metric of judicial appointments in the spring, he'd fallen back on par with the former president by August when the Senate departed Washington, D.C., for recess. The lengthy blocks of out-of-session time in both August and October pose a significant obstacle to Democrats in the Senate getting future Biden judges confirmed.  SENATE GOP BRACING FOR LAST-MINUTE LEADER BIDS — POTENTIALLY BY KEY TRUMP ALLY Chuck Schumer said the spending bill needs to be done in a bipartisan manner. (Reuters) Not only this, but several time-sensitive legislative fights are shaping up in Congress that are likely to take up valuable time. A partial government shutdown looms at the end of this month if Congress isn't able to agree on a spending deal before the deadline. This could prove difficult, as conservative Republicans in the House and Senate, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have demanded a six-month continuing resolution (CR) to keep spending levels steady until March, as well as an attached bill to require proof of citizenship to vote.  The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act's inclusion is likely to be a nonstarter for Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told Fox News Digital that the spending deal needed to be bipartisan when asked about the Republican-backed measure.

It is sometimes said that ""politics and sports don’t mix."" But frankly, politics is dotted with sports. And sports is utterly loaded with politics. Which brings me to the intersection of politics and sports. The end of the regular baseball season is near. The Cincinnati Reds (my team, by the way), just fired their manager, David Bell, after a disappointing season. There are still a handful of games left in the season. Other teams will likely show their skippers the door soon. Look for possible vacancies in Colorado, Miami, Toronto and perhaps the Los Angeles Dodgers – depending on how they fare in the postseason. But the Reds are a special case. There were high expectations with star players Hunter Greene and Elly De La Cruz. Lots of speed. Fresh talent. With one of the best starting rotations in the game, some believed the Reds could win the division and maybe even compete for the National League pennant after years as also-rans.

72,Congress,2024,10,Mayorkas rips 'politicized' atmosphere over FEMA disaster response amid GOP criticism: 'It sows distrust',Adam Shaw,"Lawrence Jones views the devastation from Hurricane Helene. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who has been a political lightning rod for controversy during the Biden-Harris administration, on Monday pushed back against what he claimed was ""intentionally false information"" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) work. ""I have not seen it ever before at this level,"" he said on MSNBC, speaking to host Jen Psaki. ""You and I both remember a time when an extreme weather event, a natural disaster, actually brought people together. Now, unfortunately, tragically, quite frankly, it is politicized."" Both DHS and FEMA have been under fire over their response to Hurricane Helene, with claims that it has diverted resources to illegal immigrants, has been delayed in its response, and is out of money. SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS ‘LACK OF LEADERSHIP’ IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: ‘ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED’  This split shows DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and a North Carolina resident. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein | Mario Tama/Getty Images) Much of the controversy was triggered last week when Mayorkas said FEMA ""does not have the funds to make it through the season."" He went on to say that the agency has the money for ""immediate needs"" but is concerned about not having a stable supply of funding. Congress recently freed up $20 billion for the disaster fund, but officials have called on Congress to pass a supplemental spending bill. Critics quickly pointed to FEMA's role in distributing more than $650 million in funds to help illegal immigrants as part of its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). Former President Trump recently accused the Biden administration of stealing FEMA money ""for their illegal immigrants.""  However, the Biden administration has noted that that funding, which comes from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and is congressionally appropriated for grants to local governments and nonprofits, is entirely separate from the significantly larger Disaster Relief Fund. ""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA’s disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA said in a release this week. HURRICANE HELENE: NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AS BASIC GOODS BECOME SCARCE It has still faced questions from some Republican senators about whether its ""entanglement"" in the border crisis has affected its operational readiness. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., meanwhile, told Fox News Digital last week that the administration has ""failed in that response."" ""They are scrambling to cover their egregious errors and mistakes. And there's an effort to blame others or blame circumstances when this is just purely a lack of leadership and response,"" the speaker said. FEMA also faced backlash last week after its unearthed emergency management ""equity"" blueprint went viral. The number one goal listed in the Biden-Harris agency's priorities is to ""instill equity as a foundation of emergency management.""  According to FEMA's plan, ""Diversity, equity, and inclusion cannot be optional.""  This week, FEMA has been pushing back against claims that FEMA grants have to be repaid, that it is restricting airspace for rescue and recovery operations, and that it is distributing aid based on demographic characteristics. It has published a fact sheet to check some of those claims. Mayorkas, who was impeached by the Republican-led House this year, on Monday again stressed that there is help available for those who need it, and warned of the effects of misinformation.

Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican former Congressman Mike Rogers clashed over national security, immigration and abortion at a debate Tuesday as each candidate vies to be the next U.S. senator from Michigan.  Retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., has endorsed Slotkin, a three-term lawmaker who currently represents Michigan's 7th Congressional District, to fill her seat. Rogers served in the House from 2001-2015, was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and has been endorsed by former President Trump.  This race in battleground Michigan is close, though Slotkin has enjoyed an average 5 percentage point lead in public opinion polls.

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., discusses new whistleblower allegations about former President Trump's Secret Service protection on 'Hannity.' New whistleblower records allege a failure of the U.S. Secret Service to provide funding for Homeland Security ""jump teams"" and their travel to support security efforts on the campaign trail ahead of the November election. One email sent on Sept. 26 read, ""Subject: Jump Team ‐ Out of Money,"" according to a record obtained by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and his oversight team.  The Department of Homeland Security's investigation unit jump team provides ""a mechanism to build the connections between mission support and the front-line,"" according to the DHS website.  FOR WISCONSIN DEMS, A 2024 WIN IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATE IS YEARS IN THE MAKING Acting Director of Secret Service Ronald Rowe, left, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. (Reuters) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), an agency within DHS, is charged with addressing global threats.  ""Jump Team members are responsible for helping to solve immediate issues, guide how funding is allocated, and to assist in developing solutions to deliver support most effectively to our front-line,"" the DHS website added.  In the wake of two separate assassination attempts against former President Trump, who is currently campaigning to be president again, jump teams have been deployed to assist the U.S. Secret Service.  SEE IT: WISCONSIN DAIRY FARMER SAYS 'NO QUESTION' TRUMP ADMIN WAS 'MUCH BETTER' THAN BIDEN-HARRIS However, the documents provided to Grassley's office via legally protected whistleblower disclosures show that fears of unpreparedness and mismanagement in the DHS and Secret Service could still be true, despite efforts to ramp up security.  ""Please do not submit or resubmit Jump Team authorizations. There is only $33 on the line right now,"" DHS officials told HSI agents on Sept. 9, per Grassley. The senator's office pointed to this email as an example of just how low the funds had fallen.  On Sept. 26, agents were informed, ""We will not receive more money for Jump Team this year.""  The email instructed agents not to use the usual methods of expensing items, laying out a process of what to do instead.  ""If by some miracle money is added, you will be notified immediately,"" the email continued.  ""The Secret Service has a critical, no-fail protective mission to carry out. Based on protected whistleblower disclosures, it neglected to transfer enough funds for HSI to reimburse its agents, calling into question the agency’s ability to manage federal resources and raising major concerns,"" Grassley said in a statement.

According to Grassley's office and the documents it has obtained, agents have been required to pay for expenses the agency can't cover.

Reimbursements to agents are also apparently being delayed, and employees are left with uncertainty about their pay.  In a Wednesday letter to DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas; acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe; Patrick Lechleitner, the deputy director and senior official performing the duties of the director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Katrina Berger, HSI executive associate director, Grassley described that ""HSI agents are deployed, usually on very short notice, across the country on Jump Teams from as short as a few days for as long as multiple weeks, several times throughout the year."" TRUMP, REPUBLICANS VENTURE TO BLUE AREAS IN WISCONSIN TO BOOST GOP TURNOUT ""The whistleblower disclosures further show that in some cases HSI agents have had to pay for their own travel expenses such as flights, food, rental cars, and hotels, and other incidentals, because HSI has delayed reimbursing agents for costs due to the Secret Service failing to transfer funds to HSI.""

89,Congress,2024,8,Reporter's Notebook: What a 'yacht rock' summer looks like on Capitol Hill,Chad Pergram,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports that some Democrats are sitting out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech and the criticisms that congressional members should be ‘respectful’ to a foreign dignitary. A summer breeze has swept across Capitol Hill over the past two weeks. Not the ""Summer Breeze"" Seals and Crofts sing about, but a political summer breeze which made lawmakers ""Run Like the Wind"" for the exits. To quote Gino Vannelli, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle declared ""I Just Wanna Stop"" – and vacated Washington for the summer. BEWARE THE IDES OF JULY: TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT, BIDEN ENDS REELECTION CAMPAIGN IN WILD MONTH One is wise to embrace this miniature respite in governance. The fall and winter will be a challenge in Congress. So here’s the ""Lowdown."" One can describe much of what unfolds on Capitol Hill in terms of ""yacht rock."" Lawmakers may be counting down the days ""Minute By Minute"" until they have to return to Capitol Hill in the fall, when election season will be in full swing. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Both bodies of Congress usually adjourn for a four- to six-week period between late July and early September. But this year’s congressional summer breeze has been more like a political gale. Lawmakers barely spent any time in session over the past few months. Both the House and Senate took off a week in the middle of July so Republicans could conduct their convention in Milwaukee. That was after an abbreviated week in Washington just after July 4th. Congress was out of session from late June until after the Fourth. The House ditched town early last month, lopping off one week of its schedule. In fact, the House has only convened for a handful of weeks since May 24. Yacht rock impresario Rupert Holmes would characterize this as an ""Escape."" Do you really need more of a reason to blend a piña colada? Expect Congress to accomplish much the rest of the year? Well, that yacht – has sailed. We’re deep into the throes of what is going to be a brutal campaign season for the presidency, control of the House and the Senate. All lawmakers are required to do the rest of the year is figure out a way to avoid a government shutdown in late September. Is Congress capable of much else? Well, doubtful. But in the words of the Doobie Brothers, ""What a Fool Believes."" A cryptocurrency bill? Maybe in the lame duck session, but doubtful. A tax bill – involving credits for parents? Same. How about legislation offered by GOP vice presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, to bolster rail safety after the Norfolk Southern crash in East Palestine, Ohio, early last year? Few are on board with that. Democrats don’t want to award Vance a legislative victory just before the election. And Republicans aren’t willing to help Brown. He faces one of the most competitive Senate contests in the country against GOP challenger Bernie Moreno. Like the Doobie Brothers and James Taylor, Sen. JD Vance is seen ""Takin' It to the Streets"" as he delivers remarks during a campaign rally on Aug. 6, 2024, in Philadelphia. (Drew Hallowell/Getty Images) A farm bill? Hey. Wrong genre. This is about yacht rock. Talk to John Cougar Mellencamp or Neil Young about that one. Lawmakers won’t necessarily don their captain hats and recline on the foredeck, catching rays and sipping a mai tai over the next few weeks. Democrats set their GPS for Chicago and their convention in two weeks. There are robust campaigns as Democrats try to cling to control in the Senate and stand a good chance of flipping the House. Democrats are especially enthused about their chances now that President Biden effectively ceded the Democratic nomination to Vice President Kamala Harris. Why did it take so long for Biden to defer to Harris – or anyone else? The Eagles would croon, ""I Can’t Tell You Why."" But since it's ""Just the Two of Us,"" Democrats were freaked out about bleeding seats down ballot. ""You’re Out to Lose,"" as Pablo Cruise might sing, had Democrats stuck with the incumbent. Republicans contend that 14 million voters cast ballots for Biden in the Democratic primaries earlier this year. They could even assert that Raydio was right when they penned, ""You Can’t Change That."" Biden was ""Still the One"" for several weeks after the debate debacle in Atlanta in late June. But once Biden stepped aside, Democrats quickly courted voters who may have abandoned them. ""Baby Come Back,"" by Player may have been the Democrats’ theme song as they attempted to woo people who considered sitting things out this fall. But some pols will welcome the early respite from Capitol Hill. Most House and Senate incumbents lack competitive races this fall. They might not find themselves in ""Margaritaville."" But who can blame them if they skip out of the 100-degree heat of Washington for a Caribbean destination? Former President Trump certainly has a contingent of ultra-loyalists who are happy to campaign on his behalf – or at least want to be seen as advocating for him. They may want to score a potential Cabinet post. Or at least duck the ire of the former president, so they attempt to appeal to his good graces. And many Democrats are now supercharged that Biden won’t be on the ballot. They will likely do all they can for Harris. So these lawmakers face a busy August and early September. But other lawmakers will coast. In fact, they may secretively ""Steal Away"" – in the words of Robbie Dupree. Perhaps you will find some of these politicians sipping chardonnay or a dry martini on a yacht somewhere as the sun sets across the water. You’d be lucky to catch them. Of course, you can always leave a message on their ""Answering Machine."" Not that anyone uses an answering machine anymore. Both Republicans and Democrats will be wishing they had some of Olivia Newton-John's ""Magic"" as election campaigns pick up and Donald Trump and Kamala Harris square off for the presidency. (Getty Images) Yacht rock might not capture all that’s going on in politics right now. One can understand the need to just check out of the political environment this month, especially after the drama involving Biden and the attempted assassination of Trump. Yacht rock is for summer. But when it comes to elections and governing, that is the season of classic rock. ""There must be some way out of here, said the joker to the thief,"" declared both Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix in ""All Along the Watchtower."" But Congress will be back in due time in early September. Tens of millions of people will cast their ballots. And no one has addressed this as poignantly as The Who. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss. We won’t get fooled again,"" they sang. It may be enough for you to let loose one of Roger Daltrey’s signature screams. Which is why the ""yacht rock"" period of politics is much more pleasant. Chad Pergram currently serves as a senior congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).

Mark Kelly and Vice President Kamala Harris (Getty Images) The Democratic senator's background as a 25-year Navy combat veteran puts him at a unique vantage point and makes him a very likely contender for a potential stint as the secretary of defense if he were interested. Similarly, Kelly's role as senator of a border state, who has made clear his concerns regarding illegal immigration, could leverage his standing on a list of possible DHS secretaries.  One sticking point for the Arizona Democrat in the 2024 election is respect for veterans and their families. ""Do you expect somebody, Donald Trump to really care about military families when he doesn't even care about the service members that have put their lives on the line and regard them as suckers and losers?"" he asked on Tuesday.

Tranel, the Democratic candidate running in Montana's First Congressional District against Republican incumbent Rep. Ryan Zinke, recently released a campaign ad appearing tough on the border. However, during her first congressional bid in 2022, Tranel claimed that the border crisis is unrelated to fentanyl trafficking while debating Zinke at the City Club Missoula. ""It is a significant issue where we are, but where it is coming from is not the southern border,"" Tranel said of fentanyl during the debate. ""It's being made in China, and how it's getting here is a complex series of things that are happening, and shutting down the border is not going to reduce the fentanyl crisis."" TOP HANDICAPPER GIVES GOP'S TIM SHEEHY EDGE AGAINST DEMOCRAT JON TESTER IS MONTANA RACE SHIFT Democratic candidate Monica Tranel is running for Congress against Rep. Ryan Zinke. (William Campbell) Shortly after Tranel's remarks at the debate, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that 36 million lethal doses of fentanyl had been removed from American communities between May to September 2022, with 35 cases linking directly to Mexican cartels. As she makes another bid for the Republican-held seat in 2024, Tranel is appearing to shift her stance on the issue.

In fiscal year 2023 alone, Border Patrol agents reported seizing enough fentanyl to kill the entire U.S. population. Asked about the previous comment regarding fentanyl, Tranel told Fox News Digital that ""we need to secure our border and solve the fentanyl crisis."" Tranel is running against Rep.

I also saw something more basic:  Our security depends on the United States maintaining an edge in advanced technologies.

Even then, state-of-the-art wireless technologies enabled the reconnaissance, radar and communications capabilities that kept my unit informed of fast-changing threats.

110,Congress,2024,9,Schumer sounds off on GOP plan to tie citizenship voting requirement to spending bill,Julia Johnson,"Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., said there wasn't evidence that illegal immigrants vote in U.S. elections in response to a question about the Trump-backed SAVE Act to require proof of citizenship when voting. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., does not appear to be budging on a recent demand from conservative Republicans to include a Trump-backed voting bill in a must-pass stopgap spending bill at the end of the month.  ""As we have said each time we’ve had a CR, the only way to get things done is in a bipartisan way and that is what has happened every time,"" Schumer told Fox News Digital in a statement when asked if the measure's inclusion would be a nonstarter for Democrats.  House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., rolled out a plan for a six-month spending patch called a continuing resolution (CR) on a lawmaker-only conference call Tuesday morning. Three sources familiar with the call said it would keep current fiscal year spending levels steady through March and would also include the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a GOP bill mandating proof of citizenship for voter registration. DEMS LOSE GROUND TO GOP CONTENDERS IN PIVOTAL SENATE RACES AS VOTERS LOCK IN: POLL Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, right, said the spending bill needs to be done in a bipartisan manner. (Reuters) Reaching a spending deal is necessary to avoid a partial government shutdown at the end of the month, and the inclusion of the SAVE Act in that deal has been pushed by several conservative Republican members of the House and Senate in the weeks leading up to Congress' return from the August recess.  Johnson's office did not provide comment to Fox News Digital in response to Schumer in time for publication.  Former President Donald Trump has endorsed the SAVE Act and recently came out in favor of a six-month, short-term spending bill that includes it, such as what Johnson unveiled.

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, introduced the bill in the House. (Getty Images) Another strong proponent of the SAVE Act being attached to the spending bill is Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. ""This is already a bipartisan issue: a vast majority of Americans agree that voters should be able to show they are American citizens,"" he told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""If Senator Schumer and his fellow Democrats disagree with this commonsense measure to secure our elections, they should explain why."" The measure notably passed the House by a vote of 221-198 in July, with five Democrats joining their Republican colleagues. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas; Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas; Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine; Rep. Don Davis, D-N.C.; and Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., voted in favor of the bill, making it technically bipartisan.  However, the relatively minimal backing from Democratic members of the House may not satisfy Schumer's desire for a bipartisan deal.  There has not been a vote on the bill in the Democrat-controlled Senate, and the majority leader is unlikely to schedule one.  BLUE-STATE REPUBLICAN TOUTS HIS ANTI-TRUMP CREDENTIALS IN BID TO FLIP SENATE SEAT RED President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' administration came out against the bill. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The Biden-Harris administration has previously come out against the bill, claiming it does not serve a purpose because it is already illegal for noncitizens to vote.  ""It is a Federal crime punishable by prison and fines,"" a statement of administration policy in July said. ""The alleged justification for this bill is based on easily disproven falsehoods."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Proponents of the measure see including the SAVE Act in the stopgap spending bill as a way to force Schumer and Democrats in the Senate to vote on it and go on record with their position.

That is the burning federal workplace question,Gleb Tsipursky,"'The Five' co-hosts react to rage over Larry David's attack on Elmo and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey taking a swipe at remote employees on The Fastest. Many federal agencies have implemented hybrid work models, allowing leaders to refine strategies to adapt to evolving employee needs and mission-driven objectives.  However, as the White House’s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) releases flexible new guidance in August on federal remote work, it becomes evident that there is tension between this flexible approach and congressional legislative efforts such as the Back to Work Act of 2024. Sens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., introduced the Back to Work Act, a bipartisan bill that seeks to limit telework for federal employees to no more than 40% of their workdays per pay period. The legislation aims to compel federal employees to return to the office to address concerns about productivity, office underutilization, and the economic impact on local businesses that depend on office worker traffic.

113,Congress,2024,10,"How US government will dole out aid to victims of Hurricanes Milton, Helene",Chad Pergram,"Florida resident Jeff Travis explains why he is riding out Hurricane Milton at home on 'America Reports.' As the second major hurricane this month barrels toward the U.S. – this one promising to be even more devastating than the last – concerns are growing over how the government will help pay for what could become millions of dollars worth of damage. Is the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) running out of money? Will Congress approve disaster relief? A Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report from August states that FEMA has $7 billion that can be directed to help with recovery from Hurricanes Milton and Helene. FEMA has a stash of money that was dedicated to recovery from older natural disasters dating back to ""Superstorm Sandy,"" which spun through the Northeast in 2012. But Fox is told the IG report ""gives an incomplete picture"" of how much money is available. FEMA disputes that all the money is recoverable, signaling that only about $4.5 billion is not obligated and could potentially be reprogrammed. That still means that some money is potentially available and could be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) for ""immediate needs."" The DRF deals with the immediate preparation and aftermath of natural disasters. That includes providing food and shelter for people, rescuing people, providing immediate money to people, transportation, et al.  This view shows commuters driving eastbound on Interstate 75 away from Florida's west coast ahead of the arrival of Hurricane Milton on Oct. 8, 2024. (Reuters/Marco Bello) CATEGORY 3 MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA Fox is told that Congress would have to vote to ""reprogram"" the older money. Moreover, reprogrammed older disaster relief money can only go back into the DRF. It cannot be applied to a larger ""supplemental"" spending bill to help recover from these storms. The price tag there will likely be upwards of $1 billion.  It will be up to Congress to decide if it wants to reprogram some of that money to address immediate needs in the DRF once that pot of money starts to bleed dry after these two major storms.  Under the individual assistance program, the agency often quickly approves $750 for each household for food, clothes and everyday essentials.  Disaster survivors are also eligible to receive up to $42,500 in financial housing assistance. That can be used to repair homes or pay up to 18 months of rent. Applications for this program tend to take longer for FEMA to process. Other programs offer tens of thousands of dollars to help disaster survivors rebuild through the Small Business Administration, FEMA and other federal programs.  Meanwhile, lawmakers freed up roughly $20 billion in immediate funding for FEMA in last month’s short-term federal funding bill.  House Speaker Mike Johnson, R–La., predicted Helene’s devastation would be ""one of the most expensive"" the U.S. has seen. Initial estimates place private insured losses from Helene at around $11 billion. Milton, now rated a Category 3 hurricane, is expected to wreak even more havoc.

(AP Photo/Martin Zetina) HURRICANE MILTON: PROTECT YOUR HOME FROM LOOTING Congress is not expected to return early from a pre-election recess to deal with the problem. ""The thing about these hurricanes and disasters of this magnitude is that it takes a while to calculate the actual damages, and the states are going to need some time to do that,"" Johnson said on Fox News. But Fox is increasingly hearing from a number of conservatives who are ready to respond to the financial needs of Hurricanes Milton and Helene. They are happy to spend the money, but they are increasingly itchy about wanting spending cuts to offset the cost of the storm. Some of those requests may be for programs that address Democrat priorities. But a senior House Republican source disagrees that the offsets will ever come. ""That isn’t going to happen. That never happens,"" the source said. ""This will just go on the credit card."" While the idea of cutting elsewhere to produce offsets makes sense, it may be politically impossible. ""Tell me where you can get the votes to do it?"" asked the source, who declined to be identified. Moreover, the federal government is already into fiscal 2025 and there is no agreed-upon top-line spending number.  In addition, fiscal hawks tried to make similar cuts after Hurricane Sandy in 2012, but they failed. ""And it’s not going to work now,"" the GOP source said. Johnson said he was ""alarmed and disappointed"" by Biden officials’ comments immediately after the storm suggesting FEMA was too low on funds to deal with Helene’s wrath.

(Sean Rayford/Getty Images) Biden suggested this week he may want Congress to return for an emergency session to pass a supplemental disaster aid bill. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said ""we are meeting the immediate needs"" of the hurricane this week, but ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Criticism over FEMA’s response has prompted some conservatives to accuse the Biden administration of diverting disaster aid funds toward supporting illegal immigrants at the border through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), which was allocated roughly $650 million in the last fiscal year. Both the White House and Department of Homeland Security have vigorously denied any link between disaster aid and the SSP, beyond both being administered by FEMA, and have said claims of any disaster relief dollars being used to support migrant housing services are false.

FIRST ON FOX: A top Democratic House recruit drew a salary worth tens of thousands of dollars from a left-wing dark money network heavily bankrolled by George Soros’ political empire, Fox News Digital has learned. New York congressional candidate Laura Gillen, a town supervisor in the Long Island town of Hempstead, drew a $40,000 ""fellow"" salary with the group Our American Future Foundation (OAFF) in 2023, according to her financial disclosures. The group and a sister nonprofit, Our American Future Action, help pay expenses for individuals—overwhelmingly Democrats—who plan to run for office in the future. According to the Open Society Foundations, the umbrella of groups founded by Soros, its Open Society Action Fund has donated more than $18 million to Our American Future Action ""to support non-partisan policy advocacy and civic engagement.""  Tax filings show Our American Future Action is Our American Future Foundation's ""direct controlling entity."" HOUSE OVERSIGHT PROBES FCC'S EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF SOROS PURCHASE OF 200+ RADIO STATIONS AHEAD OF ELECTION New York House Democratic candidate Laura Gillen took part in a fellowship bankrolled by George Soros' political empire in 2023. (Laura Gillen Facebook/Getty) A spokesperson for Our American Future Foundation told Fox News Digital the funding went to Our American Future Action and that Our American Future Foundation ""has not received any funding from them.""  Our American Future Foundation also received direct support from the Soros empire. It got an undisclosed level of funding last year from the Jennifer and Jonathan Allan Soros Foundation, a charitable group run by one of the left-wing billionaire’s sons, tax filings show. Jonathan and Jennifer Soros have also donated to Gillen’s campaign directly, each contributing $3,300 this year. Another Soros son, Robert Soros, donated $2,900 to Gillen’s unsuccessful 2022 campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Anthony D’Esposito. ""It is incredibly problematic that George Soros is paying candidates to run for office through a program disguised as a ‘fellowship,’"" said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

(Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg via Getty Images) ""Voters should be seriously alarmed that Laura Gillen, who is claiming to run on ethics and transparency, is being personally propped up by a Soros group that is advocating for open borders, anti-police measures, and radical energy policies,"" Sutherland continued. ""This raises crucial questions about who Gillen will answer to if elected to Congress: the voters…or George Soros?"" Gillen has claimed that pointing out Soros funding for her campaign is responsible for ""antisemitic violence.""  Rep. Dan Goldman, a fellow New York Democrat, has also accused D’Esposito, whom Gillen is challenging again this cycle, of ""using a disgusting antisemitic trope"" by pointing out Soros' backing. Soros' groups have heavily funded organizations behind antisemitic protests since last year aimed at delegitimizing Israel and stopping U.S. support for its military campaign against the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Liberal billionaire George Soros' groups have heavily funded antisemitic protests since last year. (Getty Images) The Open Society Action Fund’s $18,055,000 in funding for Our American Future Action began in 2023 and was slated to finance activities stretching for 19 months, according to a grants database on the Open Society Foundations website. Tax filings indicate the Jonathan and Jennifer Alan Soros Foundation’s donation also came in 2023, the same year Gillen drew her fellowship salary. The fellowship program is designed to provide aspiring political candidates, overwhelmingly Democrats, with money to cover basic living expenses while they focus on future political campaigns. Several Democratic candidates in competitive 2024 contests have received funding from the group, including California’s Will Rollins, Nebraska’s Tony Vargas, Arizona’s Kirsten Engel and New York’s Josh Riley, according to the Washington Examiner. In March, the Examiner first reported that the nonprofit watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) was filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging OAFF’s payments to future House candidates violated federal law. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit, OAFF is prohibited from spending money on political activity. However, FACT alleged its payments to eventual candidates for office were explicitly designed to advance their political prospects. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP ""The fellowship’s true purpose was explicitly described by its founder as a way to give money to failed candidates (or prospective candidates) for personal expenses in the brief downtime before they are able to file again to run for another office,"" FACT wrote in its complaint. ""Thus, the fellowship is directly tied to a federal candidacy and not for bona fide independent employment. Any claim otherwise would strain credulity."" Soros has also poured millions into several other groups and committees backing Democrats throughout the 2024 cycle. His two super PACs – Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II – have so far combined to shower left-wing groups with $53 million, Federal Election Commission records show. Gillen recently benefited from one of the groups financed by the left-wing billionaire. On Aug. 2, Soros’ Democracy PAC sent $500,000 to the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, which weeks later spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on independent expenditures backing her candidacy in the form of digital production, ad buys, and other items. During that time, the group also backed Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats. Gillen’s campaign and the Open Society Foundation did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment. Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

Follow live coverage of Biden's State of the Union address on Fox News. One of the biggest crises of the Biden administration revolves around the southern border and the flood of immigrants entering into the country. President Biden backed a bipartisan bill to address immigration and provide additional border security funding, but many Republicans saw it as insufficient — and Biden has attempted to lay the blame on the GOP.  How Biden addresses the border, and whether he mentions Laken Riley – the student found brutally murdered in Georgia, allegedly by an illegal immigrant – will be crucial. But the White House pushed back on rumors that Biden would announce related to the border during his speech.                           This article was written by Fox News staff.
