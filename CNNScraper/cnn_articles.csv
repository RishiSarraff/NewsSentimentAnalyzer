1,SCOTUS,2024,5,Redistricting battles have mostly ended. Here’s how they could determine the balance of power in the US House,Fredreka Schouten,"CNN
 — 
Multiple Supreme Court showdowns. Closed-door negotiations. And millions of dollars in litigation.
After months of legal and legislative skirmishes around the country, much of the redistricting drama of the 2024 election cycle is behind us. And it has ended pretty close to where it began: Just a handful of seats could determine which party controls the US House of Representatives, where Republicans now hold a threadbare majority.
In North Carolina, newly empowered GOP state legislators took an aggressive approach with their map-drawing, crafting lines that are expected to allow their party to flip at least three seats now held by Democrats. But, in recently concluded redistricting in New York, Democrats, who had final say over the map, adopted a more modest position – essentially turning just one Republican-held seat a deeper shade of blue.
In the South, Democrats are expected to gain two seats as a result of Voting Rights Act rulings out of Alabama and Louisiana. But a protracted battle over the congressional map in another Southern state, Georgia, has not changed the partisan balance of the state’s US House delegation heading into November.
“It’s amazing that with all of the states where we’ve had things going on and with all the different lawsuits, we are really only talking about a small number of districts that are guaranteed to change hands as a result of this entire shuffle,” said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”

House GOP’s campaign boss sees Trump boost in pivotal swing districts
“We have actually emerged nationally with a pretty fair map,” he said. “I certainly think that there are ample opportunities for either party to win.”
Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, sees a “tick to the right” under the new landscape, with the likely net addition of two more House seats that former President Donald Trump would have carried in 2020. But he cautioned that it was still a “tight map” and a “tight electorate.”
“From top to bottom, the country is a 50-50 country right now,” Kincaid said.
(Although Republicans control the House by a narrow margin, under the map used in the 2022 midterm elections, 17 of those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed President Joe Biden in 2020.)
Democrats, meanwhile, say they emerged in a stronger position after wielding the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act to prevail in legal fights in deep-red Alabama and Louisiana. Federal judges ordered lawmakers in those states to give Black residents more opportunities to elect House candidates of their choice.
“Alabama and Louisiana are just two states once thought to be unreachable in the fight for fairness that have quickly become more representative” as a result of the legal actions, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement. “I’m confident the House map will remain highly competitive going into 2024.”
Here’s a state-by-state look at the recent redistricting disputes and where they stand:
Louisiana
Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state Legislature in January approved a map with a second Black-majority district that is expected to be in effect for this year’s elections.
The action, viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers the seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves.
The implementation of the new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state’s congressional district lines.
Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker – who is also the lone Democrat – in its six-member US House delegation.
A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year.
Once the high court had weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.
A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state Legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the state lawmakers’ map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana’s Black residents.
If the Legislature had not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year’s elections. A dozen non-Black voters filed a legal challenge to the Legislature’s map, arguing it was an illegal racial gerrymander, and a three-judge panel agreed.
That set off a fresh appeal to the US Supreme Court, which on May 15 paused the panel’s ruling in an order that will likely allow the Legislature’s map to be used in this year’s elections.
New York
Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.
Then, a ruling by the state’s highest court appeared to jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats.
In the end, however, the Democratic state lawmakers, who hold ultimate control of the redistricting process, settled on a map that made only modest adjustments to the status quo lines.
First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of drawing the map used in the 2022 elections following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory last summer when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map.
Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.

New York lawmakers approve new congressional map that tilts in Democrats’ favor
On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. As a result, New York’s redistricting commission created a new map, but the Democratic-controlled state Legislature tinkered with the commission’s lines, as permitted under state law.
The Legislature’s final product ended up putting a Central New York seat held by Republican freshman Brandon Williams at greater risk for his party. It also shored up for Democrats Tom Suozzi’s Long Island seat, which the party flipped in a February special election to succeed expelled former Rep. George Santos.
Leaders of both political parties say they can live with the map’s modest approach, which still puts the Empire State at the epicenter of the battle for the House. But some progressives have criticized New York Democrats, who hold supermajorities in the state Legislature, for not taking a more aggressive approach.
Former New York Rep. John Faso, a Republican who had been a key player in litigation over redistricting, said the map drawn by Democrats “has no material differences from the current map.”
“This turned out to be much ado about very little,” he added.
North Carolina
North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.
The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.

Lawsuit seeks to block North Carolina congressional map, alleging it discriminates against minority voters
A map that Republican state lawmakers approved put three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.
The affected Democrats were Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three opted not to seek reelection to the House.
A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.
State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections gave the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state – Republicans flipped the state Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. Last year, the new GOP majority on the court tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.
A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.
Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map “intentionally discriminates” against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution.
Alabama
In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that created a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority district out of seven seats.
The fight over the map went all the way to the US Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map used for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.
The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.
The ruling reverberated around the country and affected the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that centered on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.
Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending two of its members to Congress after November’s elections.
The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history.
Georgia
Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state, finalized a new congressional map last year that safeguarded their party’s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats’ hopes of adding an additional US House seat.
The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district. But it preserved the GOP’s 9-5 edge in Georgia’s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by﻿ Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory.
Jones had ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census. In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers’ earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act.
In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans’ 9-5 advantage “fully complied” with his order.
A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds.
Florida
A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power.
This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.
The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.”
But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs “failed to present any evidence” that the earlier version of the district – which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee – contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida’s constitution.
The case is now before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats. The disputed map appears likely to remain in place for this year’s elections after the court denied the plaintiffs’ request to speed up the case and hold arguments before the congressional candidate qualifying period in April.
In a separate case — centered on whether the map violates the US Constitution – a federal court sided with DeSantis.
Observers say that in the end, the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.
Kentucky
The Kentucky Supreme Court in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an “extreme partisan” gerrymander.
The dispute centered on lawmakers’ decision to move Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District. Doing so helped shore up the GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Republican Andy Barr.
Under its previous lines, the 6th District was a more competitive seat. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)
A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state’s constitution, and the state’s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed.
South Carolina
A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines last year for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
Last year, a three-judge panel concluded that the lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.
The 2024 elections will proceed under the current map, the three-judge panel ruled in March. The judges, in part, cited the delay in the high court issuing a decision.
New Mexico
Republicans in New Mexico argued that the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amounted to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.
At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans had prevailed, the 2nd District seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could have become more favorable to Republicans.
But a state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed that ruling.
Utah
The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state Legislature.
Republican state officials have argued that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.
Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.
Doing so, the plaintiffs asserted in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”

2,SCOTUS,2023,10,Florida asks Supreme Court to allow its anti-drag law to take effect,Ariane de Vogue,"CNN
 — 
Florida’s attorney general on Tuesday asked the US Supreme Court to allow a law that a federal court judge says amounts to a crackdown on drag shows to go back into effect while legal challenges play out.
Attorney General Ashley Moody said the law – dubbed the state’s “Protection of Children Act” – was designed to “prevent the exposure of children to sexually explicit live performances.” The 2023 law makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly admit a child to an sexually explicit adult live performance that would be obscene for the “the age of the child present.”
The district court judge blocked the law pending appeal, holding it likely violated free speech and due process protections and that it was unconstitutionally vague. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined Florida’s emergency application for a stay of the district court’s injunction, triggering the state’s ask to the Supreme Court for relief.
The law was originally challenged by a popular Orlando restaurant – Hamburger Mary’s – that hosts drag brunches and claimed that the new legislation resulted in a loss of business.
Florida asked the justices to scale back the state-wide injunction so that it would only apply to the restaurant. “Florida is now unable to enforce its statue at all, to the detriment of Florida’s children and the State’s sovereign prerogative to protect them from harm,” Moody argued.
Moody additionally said that Hamburger Mary’s is not impacted by the law because its shows are not sexually explicit.
The law was a priority for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 Republican nomination for president.
The governor, upon signing the law in May, said that the state “is proud to lead the way in standing up for our children.”
“As the world goes mad, Florida represents a refuge of sanity and a citadel of normalcy,” he said in a statement at the time.
The justices are expected to ask for a response from the restaurant before issuing an order.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/politics/supreme-court-florida-anti-drag-law/index.html
3,SCOTUS,2023,10,How Biden is continuing to cancel student loan debt despite Supreme Court ruling,Katie Lobosco,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Although the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s signature student loan forgiveness program in late June, his administration has found ways to cancel more than $48 billion in debt since then.
The cancellations have come through existing federal student loan forgiveness programs, which are limited to specific categories of borrowers, such as public-sector workers, people defrauded by for-profit colleges, and borrowers who have paid for at least 20 years.
These programs are separate from the rejected forgiveness plan, which would have canceled about $430 billion of the $1.6 trillion of outstanding federal student loan debt all at one time.
The Biden administration has been granting student loan forgiveness through these existing programs on a rolling basis since coming into office and has discharged a total of $127 billion for nearly 3.6 million people to date.
That’s more student loan forgiveness than was granted under any other administration – in part due to the Biden administration’s efforts to temporarily expand some debt relief programs and to correct past administrative errors made to borrowers’ student loan accounts. The actions draw a stark contrast with the Trump administration, which tried to limit some of these forgiveness programs and slowed the processing of some applications.
But Biden’s Republican critics say that at least some of his debt relief actions are illegal and are an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Recounting past payments and fixing errors
Nearly $42 billion of federal student loan debt has been canceled for almost 855,000 borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans – largely due to the Biden administration’s effort to recount borrowers’ past payments and fix what officials have called “past administrative failures.”
Borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, which have been available in some form since 1993, are generally eligible for debt discharges after making qualifying payments for at least 20 years. The plans lower monthly payments by tying them to a borrower’s income and family size.
But the Department of Education has historically had trouble tracking borrowers’ payments.
Last year, the US Government Accountability Office recommended that the department do more to ensure that borrowers receive the forgiveness they are entitled to, after it found that there were thousands of loans still in repayment that could already be eligible for forgiveness.
Are you ready to start repaying your student loans?
“These are borrowers getting discharges that they should have received under programs authorized by Congress if they’d been operated as they should have over decades,” a Department of Education official said to CNN in an emailed statement.
Generally, the one-time recount will give borrowers credit toward forgiveness for any months in which they made payments regardless of what repayment plan they were enrolled in at the time, according to the Department of Education. The recount especially helps borrowers who may have been inappropriately steered by their student loan servicing company into a long-term forbearance, a period in which they stopped making payments.
A legal challenge moves forward
The one-time account adjustment effort was first announced by the Biden administration in April 2022 – but the cancellations did not begin until this year.
The administration announced it was canceling $39 billion in student loan debt due to the changes just two weeks after the Supreme Court knocked down Biden’s signature loan forgiveness program – drawing some skepticism about whether the move was legal.
“The Biden administration is trampling the rule of law, hurting borrowers, and abusing taxpayers to chase headlines,” Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said in a statement at the time.
“Today’s celebration of counting no payments as payments is just the latest example of the ongoing delusion at the White House,” she added.
The Biden administration has a new student loan repayment plan. Use this tool to see how much your bill would be
The Biden administration is facing at least one lawsuit over the account adjustments, filed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance on behalf of the conservative groups Cato Institute and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The plaintiffs recently filed an appeal after the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in Michigan, who ruled that they did not have standing to bring the complaint.
Lawyers for the Biden administration have not yet been required to respond to the complaint and specify the legal authority relied on to cancel billions of dollars of student loan debt by adjusting past payments.
“There are several sources of authority that the department may be relying on, given its expansive authority over the federal student loan program generally and the income-driven repayment plans in particular,” said Abby Shafroth, co-director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center and director of its Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project.
Even if the lawsuit succeeds, Shafroth said it would surprise her if the court’s decision would result in reversing the debt relief that has already occurred.
Expanding debt relief program for public-sector workers
Nearly $51 billion of student loan debt has been canceled for 715,000 borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program since Biden took office.
The PSLF program cancels outstanding federal student loan debt for public-sector workers who have made 120 qualifying monthly student loan payments, or about 10 years’ worth of payments. A variety of government and nonprofit workers – including teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors, and government lawyers – may qualify for the program.
Student loan payments resume: What to know as repayment begins in October
The program was created by Congress in 2007 but was plagued with administrative problems before Biden took office.
In 2021, Biden put a temporary waiver in place, expanding eligibility so that some borrowers could retroactively receive credit for past payments that did not otherwise qualify for PSLF.
More than 95% of the borrowers who have been granted debt relief by the PSLF program qualified because of Biden’s temporary waiver.
The temporary benefits ended in October 2022. But the Department of Education has since conducted an executive rulemaking process to permanently change some of the qualifying restrictions of the PSLF program. The changes allow borrowers to receive credit toward PSLF on payments that are made late, in installments or in a lump sum, for example. Those changes went into effect in July.
Processing claims left over from the Trump administration
The Biden administration has canceled $22.5 billion of student loan debt for more than 1.3 million borrowers through an existing program known as borrower defense to repayment, which delivers student debt relief to people who were defrauded by their college.
Most recently, $37 million was canceled for more than 1,200 borrowers who attended the University of Phoenix because the government found that the for-profit school misled students about job prospects.
The borrower defense program was created by Congress decades ago but was rarely used until Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit network of schools, collapsed in 2015.
Under Biden, the Department of Education has made progress in whittling down a backlog of borrower defense claims that built up during the Trump administration.
At one point, more than 200,000 borrower defense claims were pending as former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made efforts to limit the program. Those efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
Cutting red tape for disabled borrowers eligible for debt relief
The Biden administration has also made it easier for disabled borrowers to receive the debt relief to which they are entitled. Nearly 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability have received $11.7 billion in student loan forgiveness since 2021.
Previously, borrowers were required to provide documentation from a physician, the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs to show that they qualified for debt relief.
But the Biden administration changed the rule so that the Department of Education can provide automatic discharges for disabled borrowers who are identified through administrative data matching with the Social Security Administration – without the borrowers submitting paperwork.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/politics/biden-student-loan-forgiveness-supreme-court/index.html
4,SCOTUS,2023,10,Supreme Court lifts restrictions on Biden administration communications with social media companies,Devan Cole,"CNN
 — 
The Supreme Court on Friday lifted restrictions on the Biden administration’s communications with social media companies while a lawsuit targeting the government’s efforts to combat online misinformation plays out.
The court’s move pauses rulings from a federal trial court and a conservative appeals court that severely limited the ability of the White House, the surgeon general, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI and a top US cybersecurity agency to communicate with social media companies about content related to Covid-19 and elections the government views as misinformation.
Supreme Court says Missouri can't bar local police from helping to enforce federal gun laws
A sweeping preliminarily injunction issued this summer by a federal judge in Louisiana effectively blocked a slew of federal agencies and administration officials from communicating with social media companies about taking down “content containing protected free speech” posted on the platforms.
In agreeing to pause the rulings on Friday, the high court also said it would take up the case, though it didn’t say when it would hear oral arguments in the dispute.
Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas said they disagreed with the court’s decision to pause the lower court rulings.
“The upshot is that the Biden administration gets to keep on doing whatever it’s doing with regard to communicating with social media companies until and unless the Supreme Court rules against it on the merits,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
In the five-page dissent, the conservatives criticized the court’s decision to take up the case while it was still in an early phase and called the court’s decision to pause the rulings “highly disturbing.”
“At this time in the history of our country, what the Court has done, I fear, will be seen by some as giving the Government a green light to use heavy-handed tactics to skew the presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news,” Alito wrote in the dissent. “That is most unfortunate.”
Lawsuit targeted government efforts to curtail misinformation
Missouri and Louisiana’s attorneys general, as well as several individual plaintiffs, filed the lawsuit last year, alleging that the government’s efforts to combat online misinformation about Covid-19 and US elections amounted to a form of unconstitutional censorship.
A sweeping preliminarily injunction issued this summer by a federal judge in Louisiana effectively blocked a slew of federal agencies and administration officials from communicating with social media companies about taking down “content containing protected free speech” posted on the platforms.
A three-judge panel at the 5th US Court of Appeals scaled back the injunction in September, narrowing its scope to a few agencies that it said “likely violated the First Amendment” when they leaned on platforms to moderate some content.
The court said the new injunction covered only the White House, the surgeon general, the CDC and the FBI.
After the Biden administration turned to the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked 5th Circuit panel to expand the scope of the injunction. The court partially granted the request in early October, adding the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as an enjoined entity.

5,SCOTUS,2023,10,Supreme Court says Missouri can’t bar local police from helping to enforce federal gun laws,Ariane de Vogue,"Washington
CNN
 — 
The Supreme Court declined to revive a controversial Missouri law on Friday that prohibits local law enforcement from helping federal officials enforce federal gun regulations.
The Justice Department had challenged the 2021 law – called the Second Amendment Preservation Act – arguing it interferes with the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which states that federal laws take precedence over state laws.
The state law imposes penalties – up to $50,000 – for assisting with the enforcement of federal laws that Missouri’s General Assembly believes may be unconstitutional, including those requiring the registration of certain dangerous weapons and others that require firearms dealers to keep records.
Federal judge says controversial Missouri gun law violates US Constitution
The statute does, however, allow state agencies to assist with enforcement of federal laws that have state analogues, such as those involving felony crimes.
A federal judge in the state blocked the law in March, siding with the Biden administration. An appeals court declined to put that ruling on hold, prompting Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey to turn to the Supreme Court.
Friday, the court rejected the state’s petition.
Justice Clarence Thomas said he would have allowed the law to go into effect. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a short statement saying he agreed with the court’s order “under the present circumstances.”
In his emergency application to the high court, Bailey said that the federal government does not have the legal right known as “standing” necessary to challenge the state law.
“State governments cutting off state resources for federal enforcement is not an injury; it is a feature of a State’s settled Tenth Amendment authority,” Bailey told the justices.
The 24-page decision issued in March by US District Judge Brian Wimes ruled that the law is “invalidated as unconstitutional in its entirety.”
“State and local law enforcement officials in Missouri may lawfully participate in joint federal task forces, assist in the investigation and enforcement of federal firearm crimes, and fully share information with the Federal Government without fear of (SAPA’s) penalties,” Wimes wrote.
The law’s “practical effects are counterintuitive to its stated purpose,” added Wimes, a nominee of former President Barack Obama.
“While purporting to protect citizens, SAPA exposes citizens to greater harm by interfering with the Federal Government’s ability to enforce lawfully enacted firearms regulations designed by Congress for the purpose of protecting citizens within the limits of the Constitution,” he wrote.
Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar called the Missouri law “patently unconstitutional” in court papers opposing the emergency request.
“As this court has long recognized,” she wrote, “the Supremacy Clause precludes a State from nullifying federal law or interposing obstacles to the enforcement of federal law.”
US law enforcement officials previously told CNN that federal agents have encountered a number of issues in the state since the law went into effect because local authorities were worried about potentially violating it.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/politics/missouri-federal-gun-laws-supreme-court/index.html
6,SCOTUS,2023,10,Supreme Court declines to intervene in Louisiana congressional map dispute,Ariane de Vogue,"CNN
 — 
The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to intervene in a Louisiana congressional map dispute, potentially delaying the implementation of a new map that could create a district that boosts the power of Black voters in the state.
The brief order will come as a disappointment to critics who say conservative-led states are trying to stall court orders requiring new maps that would impact the balance of power in the House of Representatives next fall.
There were no noted dissents.
Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a brief concurrence saying she agreed with the court’s denial but that the decision was temporary and leaves open the possibility that the court could intervene at a later date.
In June 2022, a district court judge ordered that Louisiana’s map – with only one Black-majority district out of six in a state with a 33% Black population – should be redrawn with a second Black-majority district.
After months of litigation, the district court had scheduled a hearing slated to discuss proposals for the new map. But a federal appeals court issued an order canceling that hearing in order to give the state more time to propose new maps.
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund asked the justices to lift that order, but they declined to do so on Thursday.
Conservative justices suggest South Carolina GOP gerrymandering was based on politics, not race
The case is one of several that has come before the justices in recent months concerning race and congressional representation that could impact which party controls the House after next year’s elections.
The court previously ordered Alabama to redraw its congressional map to account for the state’s 27% Black voting population, which was introduced this month.
Earlier this month, the justices considered whether South Carolina engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering.
Louisiana process
The Louisiana challenge is currently continuing on two tracks. The district court is seeking to remedy a Voting Rights violation, while a federal appeals court is already considering whether to put that ruling on hold.
In August, the district court judge overseeing the case ordered a hearing for early October in order to select a new congressional map in the state. It came after expansive discovery and a five-day preliminary injunction hearing. While the state chose not to propose new remedial maps, the challengers, including the NAACP-LDF, proposed their own. At the hearing the court was expected to select a new map.
But Republican officials went to a federal appeals court asking for a delay. The panel of judges on the appeals court agreed to delay the hearing, holding that the state hadn’t had enough time to propose new maps.
Lawyers for the civil rights group urged the justices to step in and reverse the order from the panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
“While the panel’s principal rationale for issuing the writ was that the Louisiana Legislature should be afforded an opportunity to enact a new map in compliance with the district court’s injunction, the Legislature has already had multiple opportunities to enact a new map and has not done so,” Stuart Naifeh of the NAACP-LDF told the justices in court papers.

 — 
A group of Republican-led states, fossil fuel industry groups and utilities filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court Wednesday, asking it to block the implementation of the Biden administration’s “good neighbor” rule – a regulation to cut down on harmful smog and air pollution that wafts downwind and across state lines.
The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to occasionally review and revise the interstate pollution rule to make sure it aligns with the latest health guidelines and science. The EPA strengthened the rule in March under a court-ordered deadline, after it languished without update during the Trump administration.
The revision required 23 states that weren’t meeting the requirements to adhere to the rule, which prevents smog and air pollution from power plants and heavy industry from floating into other states and worsening air quality. For instance, if one state generating ozone and smog through its coal-fired power plants sends these pollutants into another neighboring state, it could be in violation of the rule.
What is carbon capture? Some say it will help save the world, for others it's a dangerous distraction
The rule is being challenged in multiple courts, but so far none of those cases have successfully blocked it. In their application to the Supreme Court, the Republican states and industry groups say the Biden EPA plan threatens the reliability of the nation’s electric grid. The court will likely ask for a response from the EPA before taking action on the request.
“The plan inflicts irreparable, economic injuries on the States and others every day it remains in effect,” petitioners wrote on Wednesday. “Worse still, the plan is likely to cause electric-grid emergencies, as power suppliers strain to adjust to the federal plan’s terms. To prevent these harms, the Court should step in now.”
CNN has reached out to the EPA for comment.
To adhere to the updated rule, heavy industry and power plants will need to be outfitted with specialized pollution control equipment and run it throughout peak ozone season, which varies state to state. The rule is part of a suite of EPA rules that both cut down on pollution that can be harmful to human health, but also have the effect of cutting down on planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants.
“If it’s allowed to be fully implemented, this clean air rule will reduce asthma symptoms for millions of Americans, keep thousands of people out of the hospital, and save over a thousand lives each year,” Kathleen Riley, an attorney for the nonprofit environmental litigation group Earthjustice, said in a statement. “None of the rule’s protections should be put on hold.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/politics/good-neighbor-pollution-epa-supreme-court-climate/index.html
8,SCOTUS,2023,10,Amy Coney Barrett: Supreme Court ethics code would be a good idea,Ariane de Vogue,"CNN
 — 
Amy Coney Barrett on Monday became the latest Supreme Court justice to address ethics concerns, saying that she thought it would be a “good idea” for the justices to adopt a formal code of conduct that would directly bind the justices.
Her comments came during an appearance that was briefly interrupted by protesters at University of Minnesota Law School in a talk moderated by Professor Robert A. Stein. “Not the Court, not the State, People must decide their fate,” chanted the protesters, who appeared to make reference to her controversial vote last year to overturn Roe v. Wade – a decision that has triggered protests nationwide.
When the talk resumed, Barrett confirmed that the justices have been discussing ethics concerns and are committed to holding themselves to the “highest standards.”
It would be a “good idea” to adopt a formal code, she said, “particularly so that we can communicate to the public exactly what it is that we are doing in a clearer way than perhaps we have been able to do so far.”
She stressed there is “unanimity among all nine justices that we should and do hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards possible.”
Supreme Court allows Biden administration to continue fully enforcing ghost gun regulations
Although Barrett didn’t address specific concerns, news reports over the last several months have detailed alleged ethics lapses on the part of some of the justices and Democrats in Congress are pushing for legislation that would enforce a code conduct.
Other justices have confirmed in recent months that talks about ethics are ongoing, although no concrete steps have been announced. Barrett said she couldn’t speak to the timing of any announcement.
Barrett, who voted with her conservative colleagues last year to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion, was also asked about when a justice should vote to overturn precedent.
She said that there are several considerations a judge thinks about when voting to overrule precedent, including the “effects of that error” on the law today and whether the error “has distorted other areas of the law.”
“Overturning precedent is not something to be done lightly,” Barrett said.
On a different note, Barrett, who has seven children, also spoke of the perils of being a working mother – noting that she shares the same struggles as many working parents.
She recounted a morning last term where one of her children had been listening to the Baha Men’s “Who let the dogs out” just before the school bus arrived.
Hours later, Barrett confessed, she found herself walking down the austere marble hallways of the court humming the hit because she couldn’t get it out of her head.
Motherhood, Barrett said, is very “grounding” and keeps her “very much rooted in real life.”
Asked if she was enjoying herself on the high court, Barrett said the job has its “ups and downs” and that she feels a “grave responsibility” at times.
“Enjoying myself is not quite the word I would use, but it is a privilege to serve, and I have no regrets about undertaking the service, and I am fully conscious that everything I am doing is very important for the people of America and those are the people for whom I work,” she said.

CNN
 — 
The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Biden administration to continue regulating so-called ghost guns – untraceable homemade weapons – as firearms under federal law.
The court’s brief order grants the Justice Department’s request to wipe away a lower court order and allow the regulations to remain in effect while a legal challenge brought by firearm manufacturers continues to play out in the lower courts.
There were no noted dissents to the order.
Ghost guns are kits that a user can buy online to assemble a fully functional firearm. They have no serial numbers, do not require background checks and provide no transfer records for easy traceability. Critics say they are attractive to people who are legally prohibited from buying firearms.
3 arrested, including 2 minors, after ghost guns found in New York City day care
In the Justice Department’s emergency application to the justices, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar pointed out that a district court judge had essentially ignored an order the Supreme Court issued just two months ago.
Back in August, a 5-4 court sided with the Biden administration in a challenge brought by a group of manufacturers and allowed the regulations to remain in effect while legal challenges play out. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices in the government’s favor.
After the order was issued, however, a district court judge based in Texas stepped in to block the regulations as applied to two manufacturers. The injunction was then largely upheld by the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
In an unusually sharp filing, Prelogar told the justices in an emergency application that the district court and the 5th Circuit “have effectively countermanded this Court’s authoritative determination about the status quo that should prevail during appellate proceedings in this case.”
The court “should not tolerate that affront,” she wrote.
“Although there’s no explanation for today’s ruling, it’s hard to see it as anything other than a repudiation of the lower courts for not correctly reading the tea leaves of the court’s August ruling that froze a similar injunction,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “In that sense, it’s just the latest in an increasing line of rulings by the Supreme Court pushing back against district courts in Texas and the 5th Circuit.”
Prelogar called the lower court ruling “a grave threat to public safety because the lack of background checks makes ghost guns uniquely appealing to felons, minors, and other prohibited persons – and because when ghost guns are inevitably used in crime, they are essentially impossible to trace.”
Biden unveils a new White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention
In 2022, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives updated its regulations to define the kits as firearms under the law so that the government could more carefully track them.
The rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of any ghost gun kit, nor does it block an individual from purchasing such a kit. Instead, it requires compliance with federal laws that impose conditions on the commercial sale of firearms. Those conditions include requirements that commercial manufacturers and sellers mark products with serial numbers and keep records to allow law enforcement to trace firearms used in crimes.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/politics/ghost-gun-regulations-enforcement-supreme-court/index.html
10,SCOTUS,2023,10,Supreme Court to consider conservative effort to block federal power and a challenge to ‘qualified immunity’ for police officers,Ariane de Vogue,"Washington
CNN
 — 
The Supreme Court on Friday added another case to its docket that asks the justices to overturn decades-old precedent to scale back the power of federal agencies, as well as a case that looks at “qualified immunity” for police officers.
The new case is a companion to a similar dispute involving herring fishermen that the justices have already agreed to hear his term. Although the court did not explain its thinking, it likely added the new case because Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is recused from the first case, having dealt with it as a lower court judge before her elevation to the high court.
The pair of cases represents a conservative attack on the so-called administrative state.
For decades, conservatives have argued that federal agencies are unaccountable to the public and have become too powerful in violation of the separation of powers. How the court decides the two cases could change the way the government tackles such issues as climate change, immigration, labor conditions and public health.
At issue in both appeals are herring fishermen in the Atlantic who say the National Marine Fisheries Service does not have the authority to require them to pay the salaries of government monitors who ride aboard the fishing vessels to make sure federal regulations are being followed.
In agreeing to hear the case, the justices signaled they will consider a 1984 decision – Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council – that sets forward factors to determine when courts should defer to a government agency’s interpretation of a law. First, they examine a statute to see whether Congress’ intent is clear. If it is, then the matter is settled. But if there is ambiguity, the court defers to the agency’s expertise.
The court will hear both cases, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce, in January.
Qualified immunity case
The justices on Friday also agreed to hear the case of a city council member from Texas who says she was arrested in retaliation for calling for the removal of a police ally.
The case allows the court to revisit the scope of a legal doctrine called qualified immunity, which protects police officers from civil claims.
The case concerns Sylvia Gonzalez, a Castle Hills, Texas, city council member, who led an attempt to circulate a citizens’ petition to remove the city manager – an ally of the police – from office.
Sylvia Gonzalez, a 76-year-old retiree and a resident of Castle Hills, Texas, who was arrested in punishment for criticizing the city's management and officials. From Institute for Justice
Gonzalez was arrested under a Texas tampering law that makes it a crime for concealing or removing a government record. She claims she inadvertently placed a copy of the document in her binder and admitted her mistake.
She spent a day in jail, handcuffed and wearing an orange jail shirt.
The district attorney dropped charges against her, and she later sued in federal court, alleging illegal retaliation in violation of the First Amendment, saying the that the city manager had engineered a plan to arrest her and remove her from office.
She argued in court papers that the tampering statute used against her was overly broad had never been used to charge someone for the “uneventful offense of putting a piece of paper in the wrong pile.”
Under normal circumstances, a person alleging retaliatory arrest must demonstrate that police had not proven probable cause to arrest her. But lawyers for Gonzalez argued that there is an exception to the rule in cases in which the law is not routinely enforced.
A district court denied qualified immunity to the officers, but Gonzalez lost her case at the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that there was probable cause to arrest her and that it “necessarily defeated” her retaliatory arrest claim.

12,SCOTUS,2023,10,"Conservative justices suggest South Carolina GOP gerrymandering was based on politics, not race",Ariane de Vogue,"CNN
 — 
The Supreme Court’s conservatives expressed doubt at oral arguments Wednesday that South Carolina GOP lawmakers engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering when they redrew congressional lines for a House seat to benefit Republicans.
The case is one of several racial and political gerrymandering-related lawsuits that could impact which party controls the House after next year’s congressional elections.
The district at issue was reworked in 2020 to benefit the GOP and current incumbent, Rep. Nancy Mace – one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker last week.
The South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and a Black voter named Taiwan Scott say the use of race dominated the decision-making process and that the state worked to intentionally dilute the power of Black voters. A federal court agreed, referring to the revised map as “bleaching.”
Alabama gets new congressional map that could yield Democrats a second seat in the state
Several of the conservative justices on Wednesday suggested that map drawers had taken politics into consideration, not race.
Chief Justice John Roberts said those challenging the map had “no direct” evidence that race had predominated in the decisionmaking process. He said that there were no “odd-shaped” districts drawn and that there existed a “wealth of political data” that would justify the chosen boundaries. He said the challengers had only presented “circumstantial evidence” and suggested the court would be “breaking new ground” in its voting jurisprudence if it were to side with them.
Justice Samuel Alito repeatedly suggested that a lower court had made serious legal error in invalidating the map by relying upon erroneous expert testimony. He said the Supreme Court could not “rubber-stamp” the district court’s finding and he noted that the individual charged with drawing the maps had years of experience and had worked for both Democrats and Republicans.
Alito contended that there was “nothing suspicious” if a map drawer is aware of race as long as it is not a predominant factor when drawing lines.
Justice Neil Gorsuch said there was “no evidence ” that the legislature could have achieved its “partisan tile in any other way.”
For their part, the liberals on the court suggested that the Republican-controlled South Carolina Legislature adopted the maps by considering race as a predominant factor, in violation of the equal protection clause of the US Constitution.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that Republicans were launching “pot shots” at the experts who claimed the maps could only be explained by race. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that the challengers are not required to produce a “smoking gun” to prove their point.
The dispute comes as the justices this year ordered Alabama to redraw its congressional map to account for the states’ 27% Black voting population. That decision, penned by Roberts, came as a welcome relief to liberals who feared that the court was poised to make it harder for minorities to challenge maps under Section 2 of the historic Voting Rights Act. A federal court approved a new map last week that significantly boosts the Black population in a second district, which could lead to the pickup of a Democratic seat next year.
The South Carolina case raises different questions rooted in the Constitution concerning when a state crosses the line between permissible partisan goals and illegal racial discrimination.
The state chapter of the NAACP and Scott are challenging the state’s 1st Congressional District, located along the southeastern coast and anchored in Charleston County. Although the district consistently elected Republicans from 1980 to 2016, in 2018 a Democrat was elected in a political upset.
Two years later a Republican candidate, Mace, regained the seat in a close race. When the state House and Senate began considering congressional reapportionment in 2021, the Republican majorities sought to create a stronger GOP tilt in the district, one of seven in the state. A new map could make the seat more competitive.
After an eight-day trial featuring 42 witnesses and 652 exhibits, a three-judge district court panel in January held that District 1 amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because race was the predominant factor in the district’s reapportionment plan.
“To achieve a target of 17% African American population,” the court said, “Charleston County was racially gerrymandered and over 30,000 African Americans were removed from their home district.” The court referred at one point to the “bleaching” of Black voters out of the Charleston County portion of the district.
“State legislators are free to consider a broad array of factors in the design of a legislative district, including partisanship, but they may not use race as a predominant factor and may not use partisanship as a proxy for race,” the court concluded.
South Carolina Republicans, led by state Senate President Thomas Alexander, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that the maps had not been drawn impermissibly based on race, but instead with politics in mind.
The person who devised the map testified in federal court that he was instructed to make the district “more Republican leaning,” but that he did not consider race while drawing the lines. He did, however, acknowledge that he examined racial data after drafting each version and that the Black voting-age population of the district was viewed during the drafting process.
Exclusive: How the Supreme Court's conservatives rebuffed Alabama
“If left uncorrected, the panel’s holding would place States in an impossible bind by exposing them to potential racial gerrymandering liability whenever they decline to make majority-white, modestly-majority Republican districts majority-Democratic,” argued John Gore, a lawyer for the Republicans.
Mace filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the high court in support of the Republicans, charging that the lower court “ignored one of the most important traditional districting principles – the preservation of the core of existing districts.”
Joined by other GOP members of Congress from South Carolina, Mace argued that constituent services, voter education and the seniority of long-serving members of the House are “vital interests” and that the lower court was “bent on destroying the legislatures’ duly enacted and carefully negotiated map.”
Lawyers for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund told the justices in court papers that the state impermissibly used race as a predominant factor when drawing the district.
“Using race as the predominant means to sort voters is unconstitutional even if done for partisan goals,” they argued.
They said the lower court made clear that the state “intentionally exiled more than 30,000 Black Charlestonians from CD1 predominately because of their race.”

13,SCOTUS,2023,10,"Supreme Court declines to revisit landmark libel ruling, though Clarence Thomas wants to reconsider the decision",Devan Cole,"Washington
CNN
 — 
The Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to revisit the landmark First Amendment decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, rebuffing a request to take another look at decades-old precedent that created a higher bar for public figures to claim libel in civil suits.
The media world has for years relied on the unanimous decision in the 1964 case to fend off costly defamation lawsuits brought by public figures. The ruling established the requirement that public figures show “actual malice” before they can succeed in a libel dispute.
Despite being a mainstay in US media law, the Sullivan decision has increasingly come under fire by conservatives both inside and outside the court, including Justice Clarence Thomas, who said on Tuesday that he still wanted to revisit Sullivan at some point.
“In an appropriate case, however, we should reconsider New York Times and our other decisions displacing state defamation law,” Thomas wrote in a brief concurrence to the court’s decision not to take up the case. He said that the case, Don Blankenship v. NBC Universal, LLC, was a poor vehicle to reconsider Sullivan.
Just a few months ago, the conservative justice attacked the ruling in Sullivan in a fiery dissent in which he called it “flawed.” Thomas issued other public critiques of Sullivan in recent years, including in 2019, when he wrote that the ruling and “the Court’s decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law.”
Justice Thomas renews attacks on landmark First Amendment decision in fiery dissent
The case at hand concerns Don Blankenship, a former coal baron who was convicted of a federal conspiracy offense related to a deadly 2010 explosion at a mine he ran, in what was one of the worst US mine disasters in decades. His sentence of a year in prison was one day less than a felony sentence.
“Blankenship himself admits this was a highly unusual sentence for a misdemeanor offense; he notes that he was the only inmate at his prison who was not serving a sentence for a felony conviction,” according to a lower-court opinion in the case.
During his unsuccessful 2018 US Senate campaign in West Virginia, a number of media organizations erroneously reported that he was a convicted felon, even though his conspiracy offense was classified as a misdemeanor.
Blankenship sued a slew of news outlets for the error, alleging defamation and false light invasion of privacy. Lower courts ruled against him, finding that the outlets did not make the statements with actual malice, the standard required by Sullivan.
Attorneys for Blankenship told the justices in court papers that the “damage was irreparable” since no felon has ever been elected to the Senate, and urged them to overturn the Sullivan decision.
“The actual malice standard poses a clear and present danger to our democracy,” they wrote. “New York Times Co. v. Sullivan and its progeny grant the press a license to publish defamatory falsehoods that misinform voters, manipulate elections, intensify polarization, and incite unrest.”
Attorneys for the media outlets urged the justices not to take up the case, arguing that it’s “as poor a vehicle as one could imagine to consider” questions related to Sullivan’s holding because, they said, the reporting mistakes were honest ones.
“There is good reason why the actual malice standard of New York Times has been embraced for so long and so often,” the media organizations told the justices. “At its essence, the standard protects ‘erroneous statements honestly made.’ While it permits recovery for falsehoods uttered with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth, it provides the ‘breathing space’ required for ‘free debate.’ A free people engaged in self-government deserves no less.”
Just last year the court declined to revisit Sullivan in a case brought by a not-for-profit Christian ministry against the Southern Poverty Law Center.
At the time, Thomas dissented from the court’s refusal to take up the case.
“I would grant certiorari in this case to revisit the ‘actual malice’ standard,” he wrote. “This case is one of many showing how New York Times and its progeny have allowed media organizations and interest groups ‘to cast false aspersions on public figures with near impunity.’”
In 2021, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch also questioned the decision in Sullivan, writing in a dissent when the court decided not to take up a defamation case that the 1964 ruling should be revisited in part because it “has come to leave far more people without redress than anyone could have predicted.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/10/politics/new-york-times-sullivan-libel-defamation-law-supreme-court-case/index.html
14,SCOTUS,2023,10,Senate Democrats reject offer from GOP donor friend of Clarence Thomas for 5 years of financial records,Ariane de Vogue,"CNN
 — 
Senate Democrats rejected Thursday an offer from by GOP megadonor Harlan Crow to supply the Judiciary Committee with some information related to the travel and luxury vacations he gifted to Justice Clarence Thomas over the past five years.
In a letter signed by the committee’s Democratic majority, the senators said Crow’s proposal is an insufficient “partial” compromise to the committee’s questions that would leave out information they believe necessary to “inform the Committee’s ongoing legislative efforts” for Supreme Court ethics reform.
Crow’s relationship with Thomas has been under the spotlight since ProPublica published a series of reports detailing luxury travel that Thomas received from Crow, as well as a private 2014 real estate deal with Thomas’ family. The real estate transaction and the bulk of the hospitality went unreported on Thomas’ annual financial disclosures, as did Crow’s reported payments for the tuition of a grandnephew of Thomas. Earlier this fall, Thomas amended past disclosure reports to reflect more trips with Crow as well as the real estate deal.
Thursday’s letter reveals that a lawyer for Crow had agreed to provide information to the Senate Judiciary Committee covering only the last five years of their friendship. The proposed response would not include – as the committee had requested – an itemized list of all gifts, payments and items of value exceeding $415, as well as real estate transactions between the two men over their more than two-decade long friendship.
In exchange for the information, according to the letter, the committee would have to “forego any further inquiries” into Crow’s dealing with Thomas, including follow-up questions.
“Receiving only partial responses during this arbitrary time period is insufficient to inform the Committee’s ongoing legislative efforts,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin wrote in a letter signed by nine other members Thursday. He added that Crow had until October 19 to put forward a renewed offer.
“It is disappointing that after many months of good faith efforts to voluntarily cooperate with the Judiciary Committee despite serious constitutional concerns about its inquiry, members of one party forced the committee to reject a mutually respectful compromise,” the Office of Harlan Crow said in a statement.
“The committee’s rejection of a reasonable compromise offered in the spirit of transparency underscores that this is a political campaign designed to discredit a sitting Supreme Court Justice and not a legitimate effort to legislate,” the statement said.
Last spring, Michael Bopp, a lawyer for Crow, questioned whether the committee has the authority to launch such an investigation because, he said, it lacks a valid legislative purpose. He said he would meet with staff to discuss questions regarding the interactions between his client and Thomas.
“We respect the Senate Judiciary Committee’s important role in formulating legislation concerning our federal courts system, and would welcome a discussion with your staff,” Bopp wrote.
Over the summer there had been sporadic meetings between lawyers and staff, according to a source, but Thursday’s letter marks a new escalation of tension as the justices have started a new term.
The committee also sent letters to conservative activist Leonard Leo, who refused last summer to provide Democratic lawmakers with information regarding his interactions with Justice Samuel Alito, who attended a luxury fishing trip with him in 2008 and took a ride on a private jet owned by a conservative hedge fund manager. In a letter in July, Leo’s lawyer said the congressional inquiry “exceeds the limits placed by the Constitution on the Committees investigative authority” and is tainted by partisan politics.
The senators rejected Leo’s arguments that the committee’s inquiry amounted to political retaliation – calling the charge a “frivolous mischaracterization.”
“Specifically, the Committee has been examining how the current ethical framework governing federal judges fails to capture the full scope of previously undisclosed gifts, transportation and lodging made available to Supreme Court justices by parties with business before the Court,” the Democrats wrote.

15,Congress,2024,2,Special counsel probe into Biden’s handling of classified documents appears to be nearing end,Evan Perez,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Special counsel Robert Hur’s interview of President Joe Biden is a sign that the classified documents investigation is nearing conclusion after casting a wide net that included dozens of witnesses during the ten-month long probe, multiple sources told CNN.
The White House announced this week that Biden was questioned by Hur and his team over two days in a voluntary interview that CNN has reported was scheduled weeks earlier. While the White House has declined to discuss details of the questioning, including whether Biden invoked executive privilege, the interview is the first public development in months.
One source told CNN that investigators have indicated they hope to wrap by the end of the year. As of now, it’s unclear if the probe will result in charges being filed, but sources familiar with the investigators’ line of questioning said they got the impression that’s unlikely, and there has been no discernible grand jury activity.
The Justice Department has said that Hur will produce a final report explaining his findings from the investigation, a standard part of a special counsel’s work.
“The breadth and depth of Hur’s work suggests that he is going to compile a detailed report to explain exactly how he conducted this investigation,” one source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
Hur was appointed in January to investigate after classified documents were found at Biden’s former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, DC, and at his Wilmington, Delaware, home.
Compared to special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into classified materials found at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, including the indictment handed down in June, Hur’s probe into Biden has continued to operate quietly behind the scenes.
Still, the protracted length and exhaustive nature of the investigation has frustrated top Biden aides who expected it to wrap up months ago given the relatively small number of classified documents involved, according to a person familiar with the White House’s thinking.
That person said some Biden aides believe Attorney General Merrick Garland was overly cautious in selecting Hur, an appointee to two top Justice Department roles during the Trump administration, to ensure the investigation was politically unassailable.
Investigators working for Hur have interviewed a broad spectrum of witnesses — from longtime advisor and current counselor Steve Ricchetti, to former White House legal and communications aides, to a former low-level aide who helped pack up the vice president’s residence at the end of the Obama administration, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.
Hur’s team also has reached out to people who worked in the Senate during the time Biden served in that chamber, sources said. That’s because some of the documents with classified markings date back to Biden’s time in the Senate, according to a statement from Biden’s personal attorney.
As part of the investigation, Hur has sought to examine the handling of classified documents during Biden’s time in the Senate, a period before many of the strict procedures now used for handling classified documents, according to sources.
That has caused Hur to confront the delicate issues of the Senate’s constitutional speech or debate protections, which limit the Justice Department’s ability to interview Senate staff without coordination with Senate lawyers, people briefed on the matter said.
It’s unclear whether and how the Senate and Justice Department’s discussions over Senate-related interviews have been resolved. A special counsel spokesman declined to comment on the idea of no charges or on any discussions with the Senate.
One person familiar with the investigation described members of Hur’s team as being professional but tedious in the level of detail they have sought in witness interviews. Investigators have asked about where staffers sat in the office, where they stored briefing books, and how they operated an office safe.
Another person described a lengthy interview with FBI agents and lawyers focused on understanding everything surrounding specific documents. Investigators appeared to be following a process that identified meetings connected to specific classified documents or notes recovered from Biden properties, the person familiar with the interview said. Everyone who attended a meeting or briefing connected the document is being interviewed, the person said.
Investigators appear to be trying to establish a chain of custody for the documents and the circumstances surrounding them to discern how the classified documents ended up in Biden’s office and home.
Another source said: “The central question in this case is: Did the vice president of the United States intentionally take classified documents for personal use?”
The challenge for investigators is how they assess culpability and the circumstances surrounding how the documents got to the Penn Biden Center and the president’s house in Delaware, the source said.
A lawyer for one witness also described Hur’s process as being slow and methodical. Investigators interviewed this lawyer’s client earlier this year, but recently came back and asked his witness for additional documents.
“They are certainly being sufficiently thorough, and there is a temptation to think they are doing some things twice,” the lawyer said.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say Tuesday if the president answered all questions posed to him or invoked executive privilege during the interview with Hur. Jean-Pierre also wouldn’t say if the Biden administration requested that the interview be postponed following Hamas’ attack on Israel over the weekend.
“He’s been very much focused on the issues of the – you know – horrific events that we have seen in Israel,” she said. “As president, he has to do multiple things at once, and that’s what you saw him do this weekend.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/11/politics/special-counsel-probe-hur-biden-classified-documents-nearing-end/index.html
16,Congress,2023,12,House Oversight Committee launches investigation into Coast Guard after CNN report,Blake Ellis,"CNN
 — 
The House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the US Coast Guard’s “mishandling of serious misconduct” — including sexual assault, racism and hazing — after CNN exposed that its leaders concealed reports documenting those problems from its workforce, the public and Congress.
The inquiry is the latest in a string of government probes announced in the wake of CNN’s reporting, which revealed the existence of a yearslong investigation that found rapes and other sexual abuse at the Coast Guard Academy had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. Dubbed “Operation Fouled Anchor,” the internal probe was kept confidential by Coast Guard leaders for years until CNN started making inquiries into the report earlier this year.
Last week, CNN exposed that Coast Guard leaders suppressed yet another report, this time a “Culture of Respect” review from April 2015, that documented racial and gender discrimination and assault across the service.
'Change is necessary': Coast Guard pledges reforms after mishandling reports of sexual assault
In a letter sent Friday to the Coast Guard’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, House lawmakers lambasted the agency, saying that the Coast Guard “may have obstructed the ability of Congress to carry out constitutionally mandated oversight authority and legislation to address these issues,” “prevented actionable change within the agency” and “likely put more people at risk.”
“[The Coast Guard] only notified Congress about Operation Fouled Anchor and its April 2015 Report when existence of these reports was going to be in the press,” wrote committee Chairman Rep. James Comer and Rep. Glenn Grothman, chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs. “The Committee has serious concerns that congressional committees would not have been notified of these reports, and the serious allegations contained within them, if it had not been for the threat of public reporting.”
The announcement comes on the heels of the Coast Guard’s own acknowledgment of past failures in a rare and highly critical internal report issued this week that also orders a series of changes to how the agency handles sexual assault. A number of congressional lawmakers and assault survivors were not satisfied, however, saying the agency still needs to hold past perpetrators and the leaders who covered up their dangerous and criminal behavior accountable – rather than only looking to the future.
The committee requested a litany of documents and information “to assist the Committee in investigating these reports, the withholding of information from Congress, and the inaction of senior leadership to combat misconduct,” including a list of Coast Guard officials involved in the handling of sexual misconduct cases from the time of Fouled Anchor to present.
US Coast Guard leaders long concealed a critical report about racism, hazing and sexual misconduct
CNN’s reporting showed that, over the years, alleged perpetrators weren’t being held accountable for misconduct. Many of the problems documented in the Coast Guard’s reports continue to plague the agency, according to interviews with current and former service members.
Meanwhile, a probe by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General remains ongoing, as does a Senate inquiry – with a hearing scheduled next week where multiple whistleblowers and survivors of sexual assault and harassment will testify.

17,Congress,2023,12,‘Change is necessary’: Coast Guard pledges reforms after mishandling reports of sexual assault,Blake Ellis,"CNN
 — 
The US Coast Guard, rocked by allegations that its leaders for years concealed damning information about sexual assaults and other serious misconduct, released a highly critical report Wednesday acknowledging it had “failed to keep our people safe,” while vowing to make reforms that would better protect them.
After spending 90 days speaking with hundreds of service members, reading through more than 170 written comments and “sifting through a mountain of data,” an internal review team said it had heard a resounding message from the workforce that “these failures and lack of accountability are entirely unacceptable” and that leaders “must do something about it.”
“Too many Coast Guard members are not experiencing the safe, empowering workplace they expect and deserve (and) trust in Coast Guard leadership is eroding,” the authors wrote in the roughly 100-page report, noting that they had heard from victims of sexual assault and harassment stretching from the 1960s to the current day who “expressed deep rooted feelings of pain and a loss of trust in the organization.”
The scathing internal review was launched after CNN exposed a secret criminal investigation, dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, which found that serious misconduct had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. It wasn’t until CNN started asking questions about Fouled Anchor this spring that Coast Guard leaders rushed to officially brief Congress on the scandal — leading to outrage on both sides of the aisle, multiple government investigations and proposed legislation.
CNN’s coverage of Fouled Anchor and subsequent reporting revealing that Coast Guard leaders declined to prosecute a retired officer for sexual misconduct “have led people to experience feelings ranging from disappointment to outrage,” the report said.
US Coast Guard leaders long concealed a critical report about racism, hazing and sexual misconduct
“For so many victims, there are even deeper levels of broken trust: in leaders who failed them in preventing and responding to sexual violence; in a military justice system with antiquated legal definitions of rape; in non-existent support programs for those impacted prior to 2000,” it stated. While the report outlined a number of changes made in the last two decades, it also acknowledged that reforms to date have not been enough to prevent assaults and properly support victims.
The review did not seek to hold past perpetrators or officials involved with the Fouled Anchor cover-up accountable, saying multiple government investigations launched by Congress remained ongoing.
Instead, it looked to the future and focused on preventing future assaults and other misconduct, describing the report as a “road map aimed at improving” the agency’s culture.
Along with the report’s findings, the Coast Guard announced a series of actions directed by the agency’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, through recommended changes to everything from training and victim support services to strengthening processes for holding perpetrators accountable.
Fouled Anchor found that despite credible evidence of assaults dating back to the late 1980s, many alleged perpetrators were not criminally investigated, allowing some of the accused to rise to top roles at the Coast Guard and other military agencies. David M. Santos/U.S. Coast Guard/FILE
“This report acknowledges the Coast Guard’s failures and uses them to inform a way ahead, rebuild trust, and set the baseline for organizational growth,” the document states, noting that many of the actions require additional funding and authority to implement.
Among the reforms are the creation of a mentorship program for victims to help them navigate the aftermath of a sexual assault, the development of a “safe to report” policy so that victims are not penalized for collateral minor misconduct (such as alcohol use at the time of an incident), more secure locks on Coast Guard Academy bedrooms and improved oversight of the school and its cadets – including a new chain of command for the academy head.
Fagan also directed officials to better keep tabs on the academy’s hallmark “Swab Summer” training program, which is run by upperclassmen at the academy, and to consider strengthening policies that allow the agency to reduce pension payments for those found to have committed misconduct.
The report was the Coast Guard’s most expansive response to the growing criticism of its handling of misconduct. And while it was being released publicly, and members of Congress had been briefed on its contents earlier, the report was specifically addressed to “U.S. Coast Guard workforce, past and present.”
“You made it clear that you want and expect our Service to confront this issue and make it better. You want our Service to deliver meaningful change,” the report stated. “Whether you’re a member who has a story to share — or the shipmate standing beside them — this is our time. Let’s get it right.”
He was investigated for sexting a student at the Coast Guard Academy. He's now a college president.
While the Coast Guard is focused on the future, members of Congress are still determined to get answers about past failures as well.
“This new report still does not hold anyone accountable for past failures—particularly those at the Coast Guard Academy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Coast Guard Academy is located. Murphy and other lawmakers have continued to slam the agency for its failure to be transparent about sexual assault and other misconduct. “It does lay out a modest plan to improve oversight, training, and support for survivors, but a report is nothing more than paper until concrete steps are taken.”
Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell and Richard Blumenthal also criticized how, despite calling this effort an “accountability” review, the Coast Guard still failed to hold anyone to task for the mishandling of sexual assault cases. Cantwell reiterated the importance of an independent investigation, saying she is looking forward to seeing the results of the probe currently being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General.
Earlier this year, CNN reported how former Commandant Karl Schultz and his second-in-command, Vice Commandant Charles Ray, failed to act on plans to share the findings of Fouled Anchor with Congress and the public. Ray resigned from his position at a Coast Guard Academy leadership institute soon after, but no other current or former Coast Guard officials have publicly faced any consequences.
“Current Coast Guard personnel are being told to trust their leadership, but their leaders aren’t holding predecessors accountable,” K. Denise Rucker Krepp, a former Coast Guard officer and former chief counsel of the Maritime Administration wrote in a recent letter to Congress, describing how she had attended a “community healing” event sponsored by the Coast Guard Academy Alumni Association last month.
“Before my first cup of coffee I learned about a woman who was raped shortly after joining the service. She never told her parents about the crime,” she wrote. “While washing my hands in the bathroom, another woman shared that she was raped while attending the Coast Guard Academy in the late 1990s. Another woman shared that she was gang-raped by three students at the school and had spent two-thirds of her life on medication because of the crimes that occurred almost 40 years ago.”
Next week, more survivors of sexual assault and harassment at the Coast Guard Academy are slated to share their experiences publicly in a Congressional hearing. The hearing, announced just yesterday, is part of an ongoing Senate probe launched in reaction to the Fouled Anchor cover-up.

18,Congress,2023,11,Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election – they’re now part of a ‘robust’ state investigation,Andrew Kaczynski,"CNN
 — 
They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.
By that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.
But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.
Instead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.

Tom Emmer cast doubt on the 2020 election and supported lawsuit to throw election to Trump
Much attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.
Now those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.
“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”
Attorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.
“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”
All 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.

Of the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.
Each of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.
“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.
Electors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.
CNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.
Five vocal fake electors
The most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.
“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.
Ward’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.
“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.
Another prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.
“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.
In repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.
“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.
“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.
A spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.
Bowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.
“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.
The spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.
Newly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.

“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.
In interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.
Then-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.
“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.
“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.
Kern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.
“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.
Kern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.
“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.
Later Kern was seen in a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.

19,Congress,2023,11,"Before he became a politician, House Speaker Mike Johnson partnered with an anti-gay conversion therapy group",Andrew Kaczynski,"CNN
 — 
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson closely collaborated with a group in the mid-to-late 2000s that promoted “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that asserted it could change the sexual orientation of gay and lesbian individuals.
Prior to launching his political career, Johnson, a lawyer, gave legal advice to an organization called Exodus International and partnered with the group to put on an annual anti-gay event aimed at teens, according to a CNN KFile review of more than a dozen of Johnson’s media appearances from that timespan.
Founded in 1976, Exodus International was a leader in the so-called “ex-gay” movement, which aimed to make gay individuals straight through conversion therapy programs using religious and counseling methods. Exodus International connected ministries across the world using these controversial approaches.
The group shut down in 2013, with its founder posting a public apology for the “pain and hurt” his organization caused. Conversion therapy has been widely condemned by most major medical institutions and has been shown to be harmful to struggling LGBTQ people.
At the time, Johnson worked as an attorney for the socially conservative legal advocacy group, Alliance Defense Fund (ADF). He and his group collaborated with Exodus from 2006 to 2010.
For years, Johnson and Exodus worked on an event started by ADF in 2005 known as the “Day of Truth” – a counterprotest to the “Day of Silence,” a day in schools in which students stayed silent to bring awareness to bullying faced by LGBTQ youth.
Trump ally Mike Johnson elected House speaker three weeks after McCarthy ouster
The Day of Truth sought to counter that silence by distributing information about what Johnson described as the “dangerous” gay lifestyle.
“I mean, our race, the size of our feet, the color of our eyes, these are things we’re born with and we cannot change,” Johnson told one radio host in 2008 promoting the event. “What these adult advocacy groups like the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network are promoting is a type of behavior. Homosexual behavior is something you do, it’s not something that you are.”
In print, radio and on television, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, frequently disparaged homosexuality, according to KFile’s review. He advocated for the criminalization of gay sex and went so far as to partially blame it for the fall of the Roman Empire.
“Some credit to the fall of Rome to not only the deprivation of the society and the loss of morals, but also to the rampant homosexual behavior that was condoned by the society,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Johnson’s office did not respond to a CNN request for comment asking about his work with Exodus.
A close collaboration
Exodus International joined ADF’s Day of Truth event in 2006 and the groups worked together on promotional material for the event, including a standalone website which pointed users to Exodus’ conversion ministries. Documents on that website cited the since-repudiated academic work in support of conversion therapy. Exodus Youth, the group’s youth wing, promoted the event within its blogs.
Videos put out by Exodus and ADF on their standalone Day of Truth website featured two Exodus staffers speaking about how teens didn’t need to “accept” or “embrace” their homosexuality. The videos featured testimonials of a “former-homosexual” and “former lesbian.”
Documents on the website were not archived online but were saved by anti-conversion therapy groups such as Truth Wins Out in 2007 and 2008. The website featured a FAQ on homosexuality provided by Exodus and sold t-shirts saying, “the Truth cannot be silenced.”
One video featured Johnson, who was later quoted in a press release on Exodus International’s website ahead of the event, saying, “An open, honest discussion allows truth to rise to the surface.”
Johnson promoted the event heavily in the media – through radio interviews, comments in newspapers, and an editorial. In interviews, he repeatedly cited the case of a teen who went to school after the Day of Silence wearing a shirt that read, “Be ashamed. Our school has embraced what God has condemned” and “Homosexuality is shameful.” The teen was suspended and ADF represented him in legal action over the incident. The case was dismissed because the teen graduated, and the court found he no longer had standing to challenge the dress code.
“Day of Truth was really established to counter the promotion of the homosexual agenda in public schools,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Those who worked to counter ADF and Exodus at the time, said the event was dangerous to confused youth.
“This directly harmed LGBTQ youth,” Wayne Besen, the executive director of Truth Wins Out and an expert on the ex-gay industry, told CNN. “This is someone whose core was promoting anti-gay and ex-gay viewpoints. He wouldn’t pander to anti-gay advocates, he was the anti-gay and ex-gay advocate.”
Randy Scobey, a former executive vice president at Exodus, who worked on the Day of Truth in the organization’s collaboration with ADF, called the event one of his biggest regrets.
“It was bullying those who were trying to not be bullied,” said Scobey, who now lives openly as a gay man. “That was one of the public ways that the Alliance Defense Fund worked with us.”
Ties between Exodus and ADF extended beyond the event.
ADF, which has since changed its name to the Alliance Defending Freedom, touted Exodus International in promotional brochures in 2004, crediting it as an organization that “played an instrumental role in helping thousands of individuals come out of homosexual behavior.”
Scobey recalled Johnson as quiet, but firm in his beliefs that homosexuality was wrong. He said Johnson and ADF provided crucial legal advice to Exodus and its “member ministries.”
“We worked with them behind the scenes a lot,” Scobey told CNN, saying the group offered them legal guidance over their ex-gay counseling. “They were very important to us as far as helping us to feel more secure legally and politically.”
Exodus International stopped sponsoring the Day of Truth event in 2010, saying it became adversarial and counterproductive.

CNN
 — 
Rep. Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
The Louisiana Republican was first elected to the House in 2016 and serves as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, as well as GOP deputy whip, an assistant leadership role. An attorney with a focus on constitutional law, Johnson joined a group of House Republicans in voting to sustain the objection to electoral votes on January 6, 2021. During Trump’s first impeachment trial in January 2020, Johnson, along with a group of other GOP lawmakers, served a largely ceremonial role in Trump’s Senate impeachment team.
Johnson also sent an email from a personal email account in 2020 to every House Republican soliciting signatures for an amicus brief in the longshot Texas lawsuit seeking to invalidate electoral college votes from multiple states.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”

Although Trump said he wouldn’t endorse anyone in the speaker’s race Wednesday, he leant support to Johnson in a post on Truth Social.
“In 2024, we will have an even bigger, & more important, WIN! My strong SUGGESTION is to go with the leading candidate, Mike Johnson, & GET IT DONE, FAST!” Trump posted.
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
After receiving a degree in business administration from Louisiana State University and a Juris Doctorate from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Johnson took on roles as a college professor and conservative talk radio host. He began his political career in the Louisiana legislature, where he served from 2015 to 2017, before being elected to Congress in Louisiana’s Fourth District.

Rep. Kevin Hern, an Oklahoma Republican who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race for speaker Tuesday evening and backed Johnson.
“I want everyone to know this race has gotten to the point where it’s gotten crazy. This is more about people right now than it should be,” he said. “This should be about America and America’s greatness. For that, I stepped aside and threw all my support behind Mike Johnson. I think he’d make a great speaker.”
Johnson’s win in the secret-ballot race for the House Republican Conference’s nominee for speaker followed Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer’s decision to drop out of the race hours after Republicans chose him to be the nominee following resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. Reps. Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan have also dropped out after earlier seeking the speaker’s gavel.
Johnson joined the speakership race in a Saturday post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“I have been humbled to have so many Members from across our Conference reach out to encourage me to seek the nomination for Speaker. Until yesterday, I had never contacted one person about this, and I have never before aspired to the office,” he said in a posted letter. “However, after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

21,Congress,2023,10,Trump ally Mike Johnson elected House speaker three weeks after McCarthy ouster,Clare Foran,"CNN
 — 
The Republican-led House elected Rep. Mike Johnson as the new House speaker on Wednesday – a major leadership change that comes three weeks after the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy. Johnson, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election, will now take the reins of the bitterly divided House Republican majority and faces the looming threat of a government shutdown next month.
Johnson’s elevation puts an end to the paralysis the House had been stuck in after McCarthy was pushed out by hardline conservatives – an unprecedented move that plunged the chamber into uncharted territory. Republicans tried and failed three separate times to coalesce behind a new speaker nominee before ultimately uniting around Johnson, a conservative lawmaker who has so far had a relatively low profile on the national stage. In a remarkable show of unity following weeks of fierce GOP infighting, the Louisiana Republican was elected with 220 votes and no Republican defections.
The new speaker will now face a litany of pressing issues. Government funding is set to expire on November 17, and the GOP-controlled House will need to work with the Democratic-led Senate to avert a shutdown, setting up an early leadership test for Johnson. Lawmakers must also decide whether to send further aid to Ukraine as it fights a war against Russian aggression as well as aid to Israel in its war against Hamas. There is widespread bipartisan support for aid to Israel, but many House Republicans are opposed to sending additional aid to Ukraine.
Hours after the speaker election, the House passed a resolution in support of Israel in its war against Hamas. The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 412 to 10.
Johnson, fresh off his victory on the House floor, said he will pursue an “aggressive schedule” in the weeks ahead and alluded to the chaos that had paralyzed the House and distracted from the GOP agenda.
“You’re going to see an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead. You’re gonna see Congress working as hard as it’s ever worked and we are going to deliver for the American people,” he said.
“We’ve gone through a little bit of suffering. We’ve gone through a little bit of character building, and you know what has produced more strength, more perseverance and a lot of hope, and that’s what we’re about to deliver to the American people,” he said.
Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016 and has previously served as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. A Trump ally, he supported objections to Electoral College results when Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win on January 6, 2021 – the day a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol seeking to overturn the results of the election. He also lobbied fellow House Republicans to support a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the election. A reporter was loudly booed by House GOP members for asking Johnson after he became the speaker-designate if he stands by his decision to support overturning the election.
New speaker takes over following weeks of chaos
The fight for the speaker’s gavel has opened new rifts among House Republicans and deepened old ones. Republicans rallied around Johnson in a display of unity, but it remains to be seen how long that will hold.
Johnson secured the nomination for the speakership late Tuesday evening in a vote that capped off a chaotic day that started with Republicans picking Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer to be their latest nominee only for him to drop out hours later after facing stiff resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. After winning the party nomination, Emmer faced swift opposition from the right flank of his conference as well as a rebuke from Trump. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Emmer a “Globalist RINO,” and said that voting for him “would be a tragic mistake.”
Emmer was the third Republican to win the GOP nomination only to then exit the race after failing to lock up the necessary votes to win the gavel, following Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise also of Louisiana.
Rep. Mike Johnson voted new House speaker
Jordan, who is known as Trump ally and a fierce conservative agitator, took his fight for the speakership to the House floor in a bid to put members on the record – but failed to secure the gavel in three separate rounds of voting that saw him lose more support with each ballot.
Some Republicans who opposed Jordan decried what they described as a pressure campaign against them by allies of the Ohio Republican. And several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s speakership bid said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes. Jordan condemned the threats.
Even as he faced stiff resistance, Jordan vowed repeatedly to continue his fight. But after his third failed floor vote, the House GOP conference voted internally to push him out of the race in a dramatic turn of events. Jordan’s failure to win the gavel highlighted the limits of Trump’s influence in the speaker’s race after the former president endorsed Jordan.
As Republicans failed to coalesce around successive candidates, frustration and tensions within the conference intensified and frequently spilled out into public view as members lamented the impasse and questioned whether anyone could secure enough support to win the gavel given the GOP’s narrow majority.
Johnson emerges as new GOP leader
Johnson has a background as a staunch conservative Republican and an ardent Trump supporter.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
As CNN’s KFILE has reported, Johnson has a history of harsh anti-gay language from his time as an attorney for a socially conservative legal group in the mid-2000s.
In editorials that ran in his local Shreveport, Louisiana, paper, The Times, Johnson called homosexuality an “inherently unnatural” and “dangerous lifestyle” that would lead to legalized pedophilia and possibly even destroy “the entire democratic system.”
In another editorial, he wrote, “Your race, creed, and sex are what you are, while homosexuality and cross-dressing are things you do. This is a free country, but we don’t give special protections for every person’s bizarre choices.”
At the time, Johnson was an attorney and spokesman for Alliance Defense Fund, known today as Alliance Defending Freedom, where he also authored his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas – which overturned state laws that criminalized homosexual activity between consenting adults.
In 2022, Johnson also introduced a bill that some have described as a national version of what critics have called Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

 — 
Republicans’ House speaker morass continued Tuesday with a little help from former President Donald Trump.
Yet another lawmaker with support from most House Republicans – Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who was picked as their party’s nominee – failed to get the support of nearly all Republicans. He dropped out of the running Tuesday afternoon, leaving Republicans again back at square one. Late Tuesday, the GOP conference selected a fourth nominee, Rep. Mike Johnson, who faces a floor vote Wednesday.
Emmer, who supports military aid to Ukraine and who voted to certify the 2020 election, saw his chances fade in the most bizarre possible way hours after being picked.
Trump lobbied against Emmer with a social media post that hit while Emmer was trying to convince a few dozen skeptics on Capitol Hill and Trump was inside a New York courtroom facing civil fraud charges. Trump later told reporters outside the courtroom, “It looks like he’s finished.”
After one fired speaker and three failed candidates who got majority but not universal support, no one seems currently capable of uniting their tiny House majority – and the idea of getting help from Democrats remains, for now, unthinkable to both Republicans and Democrats.
A picture of parties divided
It’s a situation that highlights not only Republican divisions, but also the bright line between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill.
But it’s important to note that it was born of a fringe protest meant to demonstrate there’s no difference at all between the two parties.
What is ‘uniparty?’
The term “uniparty” has been a favorite of people like Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House official turned podcaster. He’s been using it for years in conjunction with the similarly cynical idea of Washington as a swamp that needs to be drained or the belief in a deep state that needs to be rooted out.
Bannon’s goal is to mobilize support for dismantling the current version of the US government.
The term also features prominently in the more-conservative-than-Fox-News media environment – networks like One America News, known as OAN, and Salem Radio.
‘Guerilla war’
“Right now, we are governed by a uniparty,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, told the former Trump administration official Sebastian Gorka in a September interview on the right-wing Salem News Channel in which he argued then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was in cahoots with President Joe Biden and the Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Gaetz posted the interview on his official House website.
“You’ve got a small band of House conservatives who are fighting, really, in a lot of ways, a political guerrilla war against that uniparty,” Gaetz said. In early October, it was Gaetz who moved to successfully oust McCarthy from the speakership.
The parties actually have very different priorities
It’s indisputable that government spending has ballooned in recent years and reasonably arguable that it is out of control. But blaming a perceived “uniparty” is oversimplified nonsense.
Republicans under Trump passed a tax cut bill all by themselves. Democrats under Biden passed a spending bill without help from Republicans.
Reforming costly programs seems impossible because the two parties rarely work together, not because they secretly collude.
If there is a uniparty, where is its speaker?
Multiple Republicans who supported McCarthy have argued Democrats are to blame for the current lack of a speaker because they did not break party ranks and support McCarthy.
There has been no substantive movement toward a unity speaker of some sort, although it is becoming hard to imagine any Republican getting enough support to become speaker without help from some Democrats.
The current math is that any Republican can lose the support of only four party comrades and become speaker without Democratic help.
Next funding deadline is November 17
Another lawmaker who voted to oust McCarthy is Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who argued back in September that allowing the government to run out of money would not be that bad.
“Don’t let the DC uniparty scare you into thinking that a government shutdown is the end of the world,” Biggs said on social media in September, before McCarthy used Democratic votes to pass a funding bill.
This is a line of thinking that will get more attention, perhaps, when the government again faces a funding lapse November 17.
RELATED: The last time the government faced a funding lapse, just last month, CNN documented how a government shutdown could impact Americans.
Any potential speaker must find a way to both get the support of people like Gaetz and figure out how to fund the government in a little more than three weeks.
Emmer’s downfall is yet another cautionary tale. The majority of House Republicans backed Emmer, their fourth choice this year to be speaker, in both secret ballot voting and a behind-closed-doors roll call vote.
He had been working to convince holdouts when the post opposing him hit Trump’s social media account. For the fringe of the party, counts against Emmer include that he is a supporter of additional funding for Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. Foreign aid is a chief target of those who believe there is a uniparty.
A quarter of Americans don’t feel represented by any party
Politico noted back in 2017 that the term has roots on the American left, in the rhetoric of Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate turned Green Party presidential candidate.
While there is not much polling on the idea of a uniparty, there is a lot of polling about the two main political parties.
In a Pew Research Center survey published in September, just 10% of Americans said they saw “hardly any” difference between the parties. A larger portion of the country – 25% – does not feel either party represents the interests of people like them, but that sentiment is held by roughly equal shares of Republicans and Democrats.
Similarly, about a quarter of both Republican and Republican-leaning voters and Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters do not feel well-represented by their parties.
Interestingly, despite gripes about a uniparty by the Republican fringe, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to express an interest in more party choices, according to Pew’s survey.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/politics/republicans-house-uniparty-what-matters/index.html
23,Congress,2023,10,These are the House Republicans running for speaker,Jack Forrest,"CNN
 — 
The high-stakes race for the House speakership entered a new phase Tuesday evening, with a slate of more Republicans vying for the gavel after Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer withdrew his bid just hours after winning the GOP conference’s nomination.
The party is under intensifying pressure to find a new leader, though it remains increasingly unclear whether any Republican can get the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
After Emmer’s abrupt exit, the conference pivoted toward finding a new nominee, with five candidates in the running.
Members will cast a successive series of secret ballots, and the candidate who garners the fewest number of votes in each round will be dropped from the running. The winning candidate will still need a majority of the conference behind them, meaning that it’s possible the race for speaker might not be fully settled at the end of the conference meeting.
Here are the Republican lawmakers vying for the speakership:
Rep. Byron Donalds
The Freedom Caucus member from Florida, who’s among the few Black Republicans in Congress, first announced on X that he would seek the speakership to advance a “conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American people.”
Donalds received votes from the GOP’s far-right members in January’s speaker marathon as a protest to Kevin McCarthy, who ultimately clinched the speakership after 15-rounds of voting but was ousted earlier this month.
Donalds is serving his second term, winning his first election to Congress in 2020 after GOP Rep. Francis Rooney vacated Florida’s 19th Congressional District. The Florida State University graduate worked in the banking, finance, and insurance industries before being elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016, according to his office.
Rep. Chuck Fleischmann
The Tennessee Republican was first elected to Congress in 2010.
A University of Tennessee law school graduate, he sits on the House Appropriations Committee, where he chairs the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, and serves on the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.
Fleischmann previously supported Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan for speaker.
Rep. Mark Green
The Tennessee Republican has been in Congress since 2019. He chairs the Homeland Security Committee and also sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
A veteran and ER doctor, Green was a Tennessee state senator before winning his election to the House of Representatives.
Rep. Mike Johnson
The Louisiana Republican, who serves as the House GOP conference vice chairman, first announced a run for speaker in a letter to his colleagues over the weekend, saying, “After much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”
Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016 and serves as a deputy whip for the House GOP. He was previously chairman of the Republican Study Committee, and sits on the Judiciary Committee, Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, and on the Armed Services Committee.
Rep. Kevin Hern, an Oklahoma Republican who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race for speaker Tuesday evening and backed Johnson.
“I want everyone to know this race has gotten to the point where it’s gotten crazy. This is more about people right now than it should be,” he said. “This should be about America and America’s greatness. For that, I stepped aside and threw all my support behind Mike Johnson. I think he’d make a great speaker.”
Rep. Roger Williams
The Texas Republican was first elected in 2012 and previously supported former speaker nominee Jordan.
Williams is the chairman of the Small Business Committee and serves on the Financial Services Committee.
Williams had previously said that he wouldn’t launch a bid for the speaker’s gavel. In an October 21 statement posted to social media, he said that it “wasn’t the right time” to run for the position.

24,Congress,2023,10,Senate confirms FAA leader after 19-month vacancy,Gregory Wallace,"CNN
 — 
The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Michael Whitaker to a five-year term running the Federal Aviation Administration.
Whitaker is a former Obama-era deputy FAA administrator, and said at his confirmation hearing earlier this month that his past “time at FAA gives me some real advantage” taking the top job. Most recently he was an executive at a company developing electric air taxis, and he previously served in senior roles at several airlines, including United Airlines.
Now, Whitaker takes the reins at the FAA as the agency, in his words, “faces big challenges.”
Among his first priorities, industry officials say, is providing a steady, consistent hand atop FAA, which oversees aviation safety, air traffic control and aircraft certification. The FAA has come under scrutiny after a series of airliner close calls on US runways, flight disruptions linked to air traffic control understaffing and the killing of 346 people in Boeing 737 MAX crashes after the FAA certified the plane as safe.
Whitaker has also said he would prioritize technological and other improvements for “the aviation system of the future.”
“When I was at the FAA just a few years ago drones were new, commercial space launches were rare and flying taxis were still only in cartoons,” Whitaker said at his confirmation hearing. “All of this has changed and it requires that the agency look forward, adapt quickly and execute a plan for the future.”
He has support from a variety of aviation industry groups, including those representing airlines, pilots and airline passengers.
He is the Biden administration’s second FAA chief nominee. The first, Denver airport CEO Phil Washington, withdrew his name over criticism of his limited aviation experience and link to a political corruption investigation.
The post was vacated in March 2022 when Steve Dickson, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, stepped down midway through his five-year term. The agency has been run by a series of interim administrators, most recently the deputy transportation secretary.

25,Congress,2023,10,"Who is Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican who withdrew from House speaker race hours after nomination?",Piper Hudspeth Blackburn,"CNN
 — 
US Rep. Tom Emmer, the House majority whip who withdrew his bid for the speakership after it was thrown into immediate jeopardy Tuesday afternoon, has tried to balance an at-times moderate voting record while trying to appeal to the Donald Trump-aligned base of the Republican Party.
The move comes hours after the Minnesota Republican emerged as House Republicans’ new speaker nominee in the scramble to succeed Kevin McCarthy, who was removed from the role in a historic ouster on October 3. With a razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Emmer could only afford to lose four Republicans, and 26 voted against him behind closed doors. And despite a phone call with Trump over the weekend, the former president continued in recent days to post negative messages about Emmer on his Truth Social platform.
Several Republicans who opposed Emmer told CNN Tuesday they would not change their stance and called for a new candidate.
Emmer had recently faced criticism by the right-wing of the Republican conference for, among other things, voting for the bipartisan law to avoid a debt default and to codify same-sex marriage.
Perhaps most importantly, he voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, a flagrant rejection of Trump’s oft-repeated falsehoods that the results were illegitimate.
But Emmer has a history of supporting the former president. In interviews and public comments, reviewed by CNN’s KFile ahead of the speakership vote, Emmer also refused to say Joe Biden won the election and bashed the press for calling the race in the wake of the 2020 election.
The Minnesota lawmaker was first elected to Congress in 2014 and became majority whip earlier this year. Emmer, who lost a race for Minnesota governor in 2010, was a state representative from 2004-2008. He sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
As majority whip, Emmer has experience with keeping the GOP’s narrow majority in line. Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is currently interim House speaker, told CNN in January that Emmer helped hammer out the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the speaker’s office that eventually won McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots.
McCarthy had backed the Minnesota Republican for speaker and urged the conference to elect him by the end of the week.
“This is not a time for a learning experience as speaker. Tom would be able to walk into the job and do it on day one,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday.
Soon after McCarthy lost the speaker job, some members floated Emmer as a contender, but he quickly rallied around House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who later dropped out after the GOP failed to coalesce around him.
South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN earlier Tuesday that although he “didn’t agree with that vote,” referring to Emmer’s decision to certify the 2020 election, he he had not yet ruled out supporting him.
“Trust is something people are looking for,” Norman said, adding: “Tom’s honest.”

26,Congress,2023,10,One of the most important jobs in American politics has turned into a nightmare,Stephen Collinson,"CNN
 — 
Winning a majority party’s nomination for speaker of the House of Representatives usually elevates a lawmaker into the pantheon of American political leaders.
But such is the toxicity of the GOP three weeks after the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy that the nominee expected to emerge on Tuesday may never get the top job.
The nomination is an assignment to what may be an impossible political mission to unite a conference that might never be reconciled. And even if the nominee wins the gavel, the next speaker has a reasonable chance of a tenure even shorter than McCarthy, who lasted nine months.
But this is about more than the plight of a Republican Party that often looks like it’s tearing itself apart. If the dysfunctional House GOP majority cannot get its act together, the US government could run out of funding before Thanksgiving week – and millions of Americans could pay the price.
The House speaker crisis is part of the GOP's identity crisis
As lawmakers returned to Washington on Monday, there was a growing sense of rising public frustration about a House that has been paralyzed for three weeks, as global crises boil and the shutdown deadline approaches.
Florida Rep. Vern Buchanan said his constituents “think all of us are incapable.” Buchanan, who is supporting fellow Sunshine State lawmaker Byron Donalds for speaker, added: “People are very angry and upset.”
The hopefuls lined up on Tuesday at the start of rounds of secret balloting that will produce a party nominee for speaker following the failures of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan to replace McCarthy. But there is no guarantee the candidate who emerges from secret balloting will be able to get the required majority in the full House – given the extreme splits in the GOP between some of the far-right hardliners who helped eject McCarthy and more moderate lawmakers in battleground districts.
Because of their tiny majority, almost every Republican must back the nominee for him to become speaker – a longshot in a conference that is deeply divided. Ex-President Donald Trump has been fielding calls from top candidates seeking his endorsement but joked on Monday that only divine intervention could end the crisis.
“I said there’s only one person who can do it all the way,” Trump said in New Hampshire. “You know who that is? Jesus Christ. If Jesus came down and said, ‘I want to be speaker,’ he would do it.”
A new GOP speaker could find it impossible to unite the party
The fact there were so many candidates on Tuesday tells its own tale – namely that no one is strong enough to clear the field and whoever emerges may not have a strong base of support.
There are signs House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has been making progress, but as a member of a House leadership team distrusted by the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, his candidacy may suffer the same liabilities as those of Scalise and McCarthy. Another possible nominee is Donalds of Florida, a member of the House Freedom Caucus and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress. But Donalds may be too radical for moderate Republicans in districts that voted for President Joe Biden. There’s been palpable anger among such members – on whom the majority rests – that the lawmakers who voted out McCarthy have escaped punishment. A speaker from the far-right may be too much for them to accept.
These are the House Republicans running for speaker
But the identity of the new Republican speaker – when he eventually emerges (there’s not one woman among the current candidates) – may be less important than the dire situation he will confront. The House GOP has now spent three weeks failing to select a new leader – time that would have been better spent staking out a position on a new government funding deal needed to prevent the government from closing down in mid-November. Even if a new speaker is selected by the end of this week, there’s barely three weeks before the Thanksgiving break to get a deal with a Democratic-run Senate and the White House to avoid yet another governing debacle on the GOP majority’s watch.
The funding showdown will represent one of the most difficult tests ever for a new speaker. The likelihood that this leader will be a compromised figure at risk of losing his job at any moment at the head of a rebellious conference makes the position even more vulnerable.
As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, himself a notoriously polarizing figure, said on Fox News this weekend: “They got big decisions coming down the road. There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody and three of four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.”
The risk of such a scenario is raised by the fact that any new speaker will face the same kind of impossible choices that confronted McCarthy when he narrowly averted a government shutdown last month. Knowing that he couldn’t satisfy extreme demands for spending cuts from hardliners with a Democratic Senate and the White House, McCarthy was forced to use some Democratic votes to pass a stopgap funding bill. And it cost him his job.
The growing pressure to fill the speaker’s chair might be a motivating factor for the GOP to finally end the stalemate. But the risk is that a compromise candidate will not have spent the years building a powerbase – inside the Capitol and on the critical fundraising circuit – and may therefore not be an effective leader of a fractious conference.
The fact that party leaders can only lose four votes and still pass a bill on party lines has highlighted the huge splits inside the conference and underscored that there is no reliable Republican majority for any legislation in the House right now.
Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, for instance, said the leadership crisis “shows that we’re not functioning as a majority. And when you lose that, you lose the ability to govern.”
How Americans could pay the price for the House’s dysfunction
The 2024 elections are still more than a year away, but the spectacle of a House brought low by its own divisions augurs poorly for the GOP. The party cannot enact its agenda, has no chance of showing voters it can be an effective majority, and cannot even use its power to jam Democrats into taking tough political votes that may come back to haunt them – as a majority party might generally do at this point in the political cycle.
But House Republicans are not just harming themselves. If the leadership limbo goes on much longer, the damage could spread countrywide and go global.
A government shutdown could harm countless Americans – including members of the armed services that could go without pay. And the paralysis in the House means that lawmakers cannot vote on sending emergency aid to Israel amid its war with Hamas. Biden’s request for a new $60 billion aid package for Ukraine is also not going anywhere. Domestically, vital appropriations bills on everything from farming to energy and foreign operations are stalled.
“I think House Republicans know that this is very detrimental to the country. Look at what is going on … over in Israel, what’s happening in Ukraine, and all the other things we know are happening in the world, including in our own country,” Rep. Larry Bucshon told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Monday. The Indiana Republican also warned the party was hurting itself ahead of the critical funding showdown.
“I think it does put us at a disadvantage. We don’t have someone who is the speaker of the House to negotiate with the White House, with Senate Democrats who are in the majority. … It does put us at a political disadvantage.”
“Also practically for the country, it’s not a good thing.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/24/politics/speakership-nightmare-republicans/index.html
27,Congress,2023,10,Tensions between Trump and RNC spill over into public view,Kristen Holmes,"CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump’s decision to skip next month’s third GOP presidential primary debate and instead hold a rivaling rally just up the road highlights how complicated – and at times thorny – the relationship between the Republican National Committee and the front-runner’s team has become.
The RNC was caught off guard when Trump’s campaign announced last week that it would hold a counterprogramming event the same night as the debate, just down the road from the Miami arena where other Republican candidates would be facing off.
While Trump has not attended any of the debates, citing his commanding lead in the polls, the decision to host what appears to be a competing event in the same area has rubbed some Republicans the wrong way.
“It’s a slap in the face [to the RNC],” one Republican operative with ties to the committee told CNN. “An intentional slap in the face.”
Allies close to Trump attempted to justify the decision, pointing to Trump’s public frustration that the RNC is continuing to hold debates despite the wide margin he has over the rest of the field. Earlier this month, the former president’s top campaign advisers called on the RNC to “immediately cancel the upcoming debate in Miami and end all future debates in order to refocus its manpower and money” on defeating Democrats in 2024.
But even before the debates took center stage, Trump’s relationship with the organization, led by his own hand-picked chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, had become increasingly tumultuous in recent months.
For one, the former president privately still harbors resentment towards the organization over the 2020 election, blaming them for not having what he believes were the proper attorneys in place to challenge the election results, multiple sources told CNN. Some Trump allies have tried unsuccessfully to rid him of this belief – noting that it was not the RNC’s responsibility to provide the legal resources to challenge the election. Others have pointed out that his own 2020 campaign should have had a better legal infrastructure in place – however, these arguments, like many involving the 2020 election, have fallen on deaf ears.
While Trump seems to understand that why the RNC has not endorsed his 2024 candidacy, sources said he has asked allies and aides why the RNC must remain neutral in the 2024 GOP presidential primary race. The RNC’s bylaws mandate neutrality; this primary season, McDaniel has taken pains to act as an impartial chair.
The RNC stressed that it is focused on presiding over the GOP primary in a fair way to all the candidates running for the Republican nomination for president.
“The RNC will continue to enact a fair, transparent debate process. In addition to sanctioning the primary debates, the RNC is continuing to buildout our 2024 operation, with in-state hires for Political and Election Integrity staffers in key battleground states,” an RNC spokesman said in a statement.
Trump appointed McDaniel as chair after he was elected in 2016, and dozens of establishment Republican committee members were replaced by Trump loyalists. Trump personally felt like he helped make McDaniel into the party leader she is, and has expected loyalty from her as a result, sources familiar with their relationship said. When Trump was president, McDaniel was extremely supportive. And, while Trump was a driving force behind McDaniel retaining the chair of the committee earlier this year, many in his orbit fault her for Republicans’ underwhelming results in the 2022 midterms.
“There’s a general concern about Ronna and the RNC when it comes to the 2020 and 2022 elections,” a person close to Trump told CNN, pointing to what they saw as mistakes with the party’s messaging strategy and get out the vote efforts.
“There’s a lot of concern about her leading the party going forward,” the source added.
However, Trump’s top campaign officials are in regular touch with RNC leadership and Trump’s senior campaign advisers, including Susie Wiles, flew to California earlier this year for McDaniel’s reelection as chair. Privately, Trump’s team had made it clear that they were backing McDaniel against her opponent, Trump attorney Harmeet Dhillon.
Shortly after winning, McDaniel told Fox News that this would be her “last term as chair…It’s done.”
After a major political party picks a nominee, there are usually some adjustments between that nominee’s campaign structure and the party committee – something that some members of Trump’s inner circle would like to see if Trump becomes the GOP nominee.
One source noted that it was too early to have a conversation about changes at the RNC, but added that top officials, including McDaniel, should be willing to step aside to make way for new leadership if Trump wins the nomination.
Another insisted that Trump is not planning to “clean house” should he becomes the nominee.
“It’s not unusual for the nominee to make some changes at the RNC, and I imagine Trump will, but there is nothing planned,” one source close to the former president said, noting that McDaniel’s term would be over in a year and a half anyway. “There would be a new RNC chairman that I imagine Trump would be influential and in choosing just like he was influential with [McDaniel].”
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Tensions began escalating ahead of first debate
After McDaniel announced the first debate would be in August, Trump began to suggest publicly he may not participate, citing his lead in early polls and because he would face questions from what he described as “hostile” news networks.
Trump also said in a Truth Social post that the RNC didn’t get “approval” from him or his campaign ahead of announcing the debates, though presidential candidates do not have singular control over the format or timing of these events.
A GOP adviser familiar with the process said Trump’s campaign was fully briefed on the timing, location and other specifics of the announced primary debates. McDaniel had told Trump personally that the debates would start in August, according to two sources familiar with the conversation.
The debate fight came to a head when RNC officials met with Trump’s senior campaign advisers in Nashville last spring at the RNC retreat to sort out what had become a public back and forth, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.
The conversation turned into a heated back-and-forth between David Bossie, who is in charge of the RNC debate committee, and Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita. McDaniel and Wiles stepped in break it up.
As it became clear Trump would not likely participate in the first debate, McDaniel and Bossie privately visited Trump at Bedminster in July to encourage him to participate in the debates, CNN previously reported. Trump was noncommittal on his plans during that meeting. However, in the weeks that followed, he increasingly became frustrated with McDaniel and Bossie for continuing to try and pressure him into attending – something that has also contributed to the straining of their relationship, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
“Sitting there, having Bossie and Ronna tell him that it’s a good idea to go to a debate where he’s going to get the crap kicked out of him by all the other candidates, never mind the moderators, there’s no upside,” the source said. “He didn’t appreciate it.”
“It just started to grate on him,” the source said.
RNC officials and members pushed back at the idea that they would not hold the debate just because Trump is leading in the polls.
“The reality is 50% of the base is with him – that means there’s another 50% that’s not,” the Republican operative said. “That 50% has to feel like there’s a fair process that played out if they’re going to turn out if Trump is nominated and actually vote for him.”
While Trump bristled at the date, which he said was early, the sources said that he did not completely shut it down. But two Trump sources familiar with the conversations between Trump’s campaign and the RNC said that his team and the former president himself had made it clear that he would not attend a debate before Labor Day.
Trump instead sat for a pre-recorded interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
The legal complications
The link between Trump world and McDaniel and the RNC goes deeper than politics, as the chairwoman and the committee have become entangled in Trump’s legal woes. The RNC paid millions of dollars to law firms representing Trump in various investigations, but stopped after Trump announced his third presidential run due to their neutrality policy.
The committee “cannot pay legal bills for any candidate that’s announced,” McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash last November when asked whether the RNC would stop paying Trump’s legal bills if he became a candidate.
“We cannot do in kind contributions to any candidate right now. He’s the former president being attacked from every which way with lawsuits, and he’s certainly raised more under the RNC than we’ve spent on these bills,” she added at the time.
McDaniel also testified before the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and is likely to testify in the federal trial as well. The federal case into Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is just one of several trials Trump is facing early next year.
Earlier this month, the judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case signed an order to compel McDaniel to testify at the trial.
“You’d think that maybe everyone attacking her would take into consideration that she’s probably going to end up in several of his trials,” the GOP operative told CNN.
As of now, it’s unclear how her potential testimony could further impact their relationship, but her role as a likely witness could further add to the strain between the two.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/politics/trump-rnc-relationship/index.html
28,Congress,2023,10,House nears third week without speaker as eight Republicans vie for gavel,Isabelle D'Antonio,"CNN
 — 
A crowded field of Republicans are vying to earn the support of their conference to wield the gavel, throwing the chamber into even more uncertainty after three weeks without a speaker.
The conference is searching for a new speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race. The chamber has been without a speaker since House Republicans ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy earlier this month.
Eight House Republicans are running for the position, including GOP Whip Tom Emmer, who is endorsed by McCarthy. Emmer has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage, according to GOP sources. He could face an uphill battle, however, against allies of former President Donald Trump who have been quick to criticize Emmer for voting to certify the 2020 election.
The speaker hopefuls spent the weekend working the phones to win their conference’s support ahead of a candidate forum Monday evening and secret-ballot election Tuesday.
Emmer spoke with Trump by phone over the weekend, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, and Emmer touted his “strong working relationship” with the former president on social media Monday.
“Thank you, Mr. President,” Emmer posted on X, alongside a video clip of Trump saying he’s “always” gotten along with Emmer. “If my colleagues elect me Speaker of the House, I look forward to continuing our strong working relationship.”
Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, another candidate for speaker, said Monday that he also spoke with Trump about his bid.
“He called me and we had a polite conversation. I believe that the president is interested in having somebody he can work with, and I think I’m one of those people,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju, adding that he did not ask for Trump’s endorsement.
These are the other GOP representatives running for speaker:
Jack Bergman of Michigan, a retired 40-year veteran of the US Marines.
Byron Donalds of Florida, a second-term member of the far-right Freedom Caucus.
Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, chair of the conservative group known as the Republican Study Committee – which wields a large bloc of GOP members.
Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice chairman for the House Republican Conference.
Gary Palmer of Alabama, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee.
Austin Scott of Georgia, the seven-term ally of McCarthy who quickly dropped out of a last-minute challenge to Jordan last week.
Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania had also been in the running but dropped out of the race Monday evening.
Speaking to reporters, Meuser said, “I felt that it was in the best interest in the end.”
“We have great candidates, and I wrote up a plan of how to improve the speaker’s office – making it a members-first office, which in the end is a people’s first office – and a few of the candidates up there have adopted some of my ideas,” he said.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 floor votes needed to win the gavel.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and the Israel-Hamas war.
The government runs out of funding in less than a month, after narrowly avoiding a shutdown with a stopgap funding bill last month. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
And there is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel’s war against Hamas. President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Israel and Ukraine, which is said to be running out of munitions in its fight against Russia’s invasion.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to oust McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day.

29,Congress,2023,10,Sen. Bob Menendez pleads not guilty to charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt,Nicki Brown,"CNN
 — 
Sen. Bob Menendez pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt.
The New Jersey Democrat personally entered his plea before district Judge Sidney H. Stein.
Menendez, his wife Nadine Arslanian Menendez, and three other co-defendants were indicted last month on corruption-related offenses and are accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes” in exchange for the senator’s influence. Menendez and the others pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial date has been set for May.
In a statement released by his office after his arraignment, Menendez dismissed the charge “as outrageous as it is absurd.”
“I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country — the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom,” he said, adding later: “I will not litigate this case through the press, but have made it abundantly clear that I have done nothing wrong and once all the facts are presented will be found innocent.”
The additional charge unveiled early this month in a superseding indictment filed against Menendez, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the alleged actions, adds a new dimension to the case by alleging a US senator was working on behalf of another country.
Prosecutors allege Nadine Menendez and businessman Wael Hana failed to register as agents working on behalf of Egypt and conspired to have the senator act on behalf of Egypt. Nadine Menendez and Hana both pleaded not guilty to the superseding indictment last week.
Menendez stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee last month when he was initially charged but has rejected calls to resign as New Jersey’s senior senator.
It is illegal for a member of Congress or any public official to act as foreign agent.
The senator stressed his loyalty to the US in a statement earlier this month, arguing that the new charge goes against his “long record of standing up for human rights and democracy in Egypt and in challenging leaders of that country.”
The new charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Menendez and his wife are now facing as much as 50 years in prison if convicted.

30,Congress,2023,10,Uncertainty looms for future aid to Ukraine and Israel as speaker drama continues,Lauren Fox,"Washington
CNN
 — 
As the search for a speaker continues, some House Republicans are already casting doubt over the future of the administration’s $105 billion security supplemental request for aid to Ukraine, Israel, the southern border and Taiwan, a major issue that any future speaker will have to contend with.
A number of Republican rank-and-file members in the House have made clear that the administration’s request won’t survive their chamber without changes and many House Republicans have already said that additional funding for border security isn’t enough without a policy overhaul, which would likely be a red line for many Senate Democrats.
“This is a hell no. And no one in the House GOP should support it. It’s asinine, unpaid for, ineffective and dangerous,” Rep. Chip Roy of Texas posted on X about the supplemental request.
Other Republicans who support parts of the request blasted the administration for trying to tie Israel funding to funding for Ukraine, which has seen cratering support in recent months.
“Israel deserves to have a conversation that is devoted to them right now,” Republican Rep. Mike Garcia of California, a defense appropriator, told CNN. “We need to strip out the Ukraine funding and we need to give the Israeli partners the respect they deserve.”
Even those who have backed Ukraine aid and have pledged to support it in the future want to understand why the administration is asking for so much.
“It seems like a lot,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said. “I’d like to see the breakout of the needs. I want to support it, but that seems like a lot of money.”
There is broad bipartisan support for Ukraine, but funding the military efforts there has become a flashpoint for conservatives and an issue that will likely bedevil a future speaker just as it had former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The administration’s request included more than $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine with over $14 billion for Israel. The Israel funding will likely move quickly in the House, but it’s very likely that the future speaker would decouple the requests so they are voted on individually.
The tightrope any future speaker will walk is that the Republican conference is divided over sending additional aid to Ukraine. On the one hand, hardliners derided McCarthy for his support of the country early on in the war and McCarthy had remained publicly noncommittal about putting a future aid package on the floor. But there are some members for whom support Ukraine is an essential issue.
“I support Ukraine and Israel. I think we should do both,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said. “I think we should do whatever gets both of them across the finish line, whatever strategy works best. I don’t want to hold back one for the other. I support both.”
To this point, the supplemental request has been overshadowed by a chaotic search for House speaker, but it may come into focus soon as the Senate prepares to take up the request quickly.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has made clear he hopes to take up the supplemental request as soon as possible.
“This legislation is too important to wait for the House to settle their chaos. Senate Democrats will move expeditiously on this request, and we hope that our Republican colleagues across the aisle will join us to pass this much-needed funding,” Schumer said.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has scheduled a hearing for October 31 to review the request and will hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who are expected to testify and make the case for why the money is necessary.
But the House cannot begin to consider the legislation on the floor in any form until a speaker is selected.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/politics/house-aid-ukraine-israel/index.html
31,Congress,2023,10,House GOP circus embarrasses senior party leaders as the country and the world wait for Republicans to pick a speaker,Stephen Collinson,"CNN
 — 
House Republicans on Monday open the next act of their Washington farce, desperately searching for a speaker after ousting the incumbent and rejecting two would-be replacements while still clueless about how to dig out of the crisis.
Congress has seen impeachments, fiscal cliffs, government shutdowns and even an insurrection, but the modern Republican Party is surpassing itself with a debacle that is embarrassing senior party leaders and threatens to damage the House GOP’s hopes of saving and expanding upon its tiny majority in 2024. Far from tackling critical bills needed to fund the government, the leaderless House can’t do the basics, like pass a resolution condemning the Hamas attacks in Israel.
At least nine new candidates have signed up to run for speaker ahead of a new selection process this week after Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan folded his futile bid for the job on Friday, following Majority Leader Steve Scalise the week before. The uprising that began nearly three weeks ago with the toppling of Speaker Kevin McCarthy has now weakened three of the most powerful figures in the House GOP. Perhaps a newcomer can change the calculations of the extremists who opposed McCarthy and Scalise and the more moderate battleground district members who doomed the bulldozing Jordan. But there’s no sign yet any of them can win the 217 votes needed in the full chamber to claim the top job. And more importantly, for whoever eventually wins the gavel, the task of making the House a functional legislative body looks impossible after weeks of GOP infighting that cultivated fresh grievances and demands for vengeance.

“You know, getting 217 is obviously going to be very difficult and is the sort of Rubik’s Cube of the answer to all of this,” Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
Twisting colored squares together in the right order seems simple by comparison with attempts to unite a House Republican conference unable to comprehend how clownish it looks. Republicans, determined to fight a civil war over fractures in the conservative movement, seem oblivious to the degenerating global stability all around them or the shutdown threat directly in front of them.

CNN's Manu Raju details McConnell plan for the 2024 election
03:55 - Source: CNN
The vacuum is rendering one branch of the US government inoperable, since the Senate can’t pass laws without the other chamber. “We need (a speaker) because the House can’t do anything without a speaker,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday.
The imbroglio is far more serious than the classic congressional drama wherein lawmakers procrastinate and work through their political rituals, and then finally get their acts together. In a practical sense, the absence of a speaker means the House cannot support Israel in accordance with a new aid request from President Joe Biden. A critical and bitter debate over new Ukraine funding – $60 billion of which was requested by Biden last week – cannot begin. Before long, the blocked US lifeline could have grave consequences in Ukraine’s war for survival and boost Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is betting US resolve will wane – not a bad wager considering increasing GOP resistance to defending the democratic government in Kyiv.
But forget reverberations overseas. The House meltdown could soon begin to harm millions of Americans. The GOP has wasted three of the precious weeks that it had to solve a spending showdown that could shut down the government by the middle of November. Even if the party suddenly moves quickly toward choosing a new leader, it’s unlikely much serious work gets done this week either.
What the vacant speakership says about the GOP
The empty speaker’s chair offers an eloquent metaphor for how internal political chaos is compromising American leadership. It’s also threatening the more-than-two-centuries-long experiment in self-government by the people that relies ultimately on no one getting everything they want but accepting incremental change. That’s a concept that the modern GOP seems to reject – as evidenced by the claims of Donald Trump and many of his acolytes in the House that they have the right to rule even though the former president’s bid for a second term was rejected by voters in 2020.
The House Republican conference is showing that it cannot even compromise with itself, let alone construct a unified position before eventually accepting the trade-offs that will be needed in dealing with a Democratic-run Senate and White House. Whichever Republican finally wins the speakership will face similar questions to the ones that eventually cost McCarthy his dream job – namely whether to indulge far-right Republicans with extreme spending cuts that the White House and the Senate will never accept, or to avert a government shutdown by advancing stopgap funding with some Democratic votes. Unless a new speaker can change the dynamic, their tenure risks being even shorter than that of the California Republican.
A new speaker will also be hampered by the reality that chaos and a neutered government are a welcome outcome for many grassroots Republicans in a party transformed by Trump. Many of these lawmakers have perfected the extremism that hedges against primary challenges and the cacophony that pleases the ratings-driven demands of conservative media. Influence in the GOP is no longer bought by years of service that paves the way for committee chairmanships. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the eight Republicans who voted to can McCarthy, understands the equation well – which is one reason why senior figures bemoaning the need to “govern” aren’t persuading rabble-rousing members. The most obvious representative of this style of stunt politics Republicanism is Trump – who, despite being impeached twice, falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen and facing four criminal trials, is the runaway front-runner for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.
Embarrassed GOP leaders plea for an end to the mess
Sheer fatigue in the House GOP may create an opening for a candidate who could become a weak speaker with no national name recognition but who could attract the least rancor from across the divided conference. Until then, serious Republican legislators in the House only have the power to express dismay as America’s enemies delight in watching US democracy founder.
“This is probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve seen because if we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern. And every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on ABC News’ “This Week.”
McCarthy, who supported Jordan but is now backing House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, warned on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the situation cannot be allowed to endure much longer. “This is embarrassing for the Republican Party. It’s embarrassing for the nation, and we need to look at one another and solve the problem,” the former speaker said.
Emmer is among nine GOP candidates seeking to lock down votes ahead of an expected secret ballot to pick a speaker nominee on Tuesday. The Minnesota Republican’s problem, however, is much like McCarthy’s – he is likely to struggle to win the support of the far-right House Freedom Caucus that reviles the GOP leadership team.
The other members throwing their hat into a ring that does not include a single woman are Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee; Jack Bergman of Michigan, a mainstream conservative and Marine veteran; Austin Scott of Georgia, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week but quickly dropped out; Byron Donalds of Florida, a rising star Freedom Caucus member and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress; Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the GOP conference vice chairman; Pete Sessions of Texas, a congressional veteran who lost his seat in 2018 and soon returned to represent another one; Dan Meuser, a former Pennsylvania secretary of revenue and member of the Problem Solvers Caucus; and Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the Republican Policy Committee.
Newt Gingrich – a former Republican speaker who is credited with inventing back in the 1990s the highly partisan style of hardball governing preferred by today’s GOP – said party leaders must choose anyone who can get to a House majority regardless of who they are, or the charade could go on for weeks. And he warned with critical government funding and budget bills looming, the GOP doesn’t just have to unite on a new speaker but on a new period of unified governance.
“That 217 has to be committed not just to elect a speaker, but to stick together for the next five or six months. They got big decisions coming down the road,” Gingrich told Fox News. “There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody, and three or four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.
“So they need to pick somebody to get stability.”
Putting aside the irony of those words coming from the firebrand Georgia Republican, the House GOP has shown over the last three weeks that stability is the last thing the party is able, or even wants, to deliver.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/23/politics/republicans-house-speakership-circus/index.html
32,Congress,2023,10,House GOP Whip Tom Emmer moves to lock in support for speakership amid crowded field,Manu Raju,"CNN
 — 
House speaker candidate Tom Emmer, the GOP whip, has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage heading into a secret-ballot election to nominate their candidate Tuesday, according to Republican sources.
But it’s hard to assess his chances fully since it’s a crowded field, with at least seven candidates working the phones all weekend to win a majority of support within the conference.
Even if Emmer were to win the nomination, Republican sources are uncertain he can get 217 votes on the floor, as he could face resistance from members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus skeptical of the GOP leadership team.
House Republicans are searching for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race. The chamber has been without a speaker for more than two weeks after Kevin McCarthy’s historic ouster this month.
Emmer, of Minnesota, said in a letter to colleagues Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy has endorsed Emmer for speaker, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
McCarthy on Sunday urged his House colleagues to elect Emmer but stopped short of ruling out another speakership run himself.
“He’s been in the room with all of our successes,” the California Republican said of Emmer. “He sets himself head and shoulders above all those others who want to run.
“This is not a time for a learning experience as speaker. Tom would be able to walk into the job and do it on Day 1,” McCarthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
McCarthy once again demurred when asked about returning to wield the gavel.
“I don’t need the title. I’m going to help in any way I can,” he said. “I’m supporting Tom Emmer, but I’m going to tell you, I’m still a member of Congress, and I’m going to lead in any capacity I can to help to protect America.”

33,Congress,2023,10,Liz Cheney ties House GOP chaos to Trump’s behavior,Abby Baggini,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney on Sunday tied the “dangerous” House GOP chaos to former President Donald Trump’s behavior and the Republicans supporting him.
“I wish that it were surprising. You know, what we’ve seen is a result of really the leadership decisions that Kevin McCarthy made back after the 2020 election and certainly after January 6. And, you know, looking the other way in the face of the kind of assault on our democracy that we’ve seen from Donald Trump and his allies in the House,” Cheney told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
Her comments come amid the House GOP’s high-stakes speakership battle after McCarthy was ousted more than two weeks ago. Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race, prompting a crowded candidate field to seek the speakership.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
Cheney, who was one of Trump’s strongest critics in Congress, said Sunday she has also “been watching the extent to which political violence and the threats of violence have now reared their head once again. Those have become part of our politics in a way that certainly they never should.”
Several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s House speakership bid said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes.
“Now, that kind of acceptance of violence is completely inappropriate and dangerous in our politics. So, I – we need people who are serious and who recognize and understand the dangers that we’re facing globally, as well as from Donald Trump and those who support him,” she said.
Trump, Cheney added, “is the single most dangerous threat we face” as a nation.
“He cannot be the next president. If he is, all of the things that he attempted to do but was stopped from doing by responsible people around him at the Department of Justice, at the White House Counsel’s office, he will do. There will be no guardrails and everyone has been warned.”

34,Congress,2023,10,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024,Simone Pathe,"CNN
 — 
While events on the other side of the world – and the other end of the US Capitol – have dominated recent news, the race for control of the Senate is a crucial factor in what Washington could look like after next year’s elections.
The 2024 Senate map is advantageous for Republicans as they try to pick up the one or two seats needed to flip the chamber, depending on who wins the White House next year. Members of the Senate Democratic Caucus are defending the most competitive seats – the top eight on this list of 10 seats most likely to flip – which is not likely to change ahead of November 2024.
The order of the ranking, however, is changing. (Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed.) Pennsylvania, for example, shoots up from No. 7 in July to No. 4 this month – in large part because it’s the one battleground where Republicans aren’t facing a messy primary.
GOP candidate fields elsewhere have only grown over the past couple of months, despite the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s new policy of taking sides in primaries. Besides Pennsylvania, the national party has made its preference known for specific candidates in West Virginia, Montana, Nevada and Michigan. The NRSC is neutral in Ohio’s crowded primary and hasn’t ruled out endorsing in Arizona.
How the Senate GOP's campaign chief is navigating Trump and messy primaries
Whether engaging in primaries early on will pay off remains to be seen. So far, however, NRSC Chairman Steve Daines’ tactic of keeping Donald Trump close appears to be working, as the former president hasn’t yet endorsed against any of the campaign committee’s picks.
The GOP presidential front-runner – with his four criminal indictments – is likely to be a liability in some places next year if he is the party’s nominee. But Republicans take comfort in the fact that he won the top three states on this list handily in 2020 and red-state Democrats will have to run with an unpopular President Joe Biden atop the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized politics, it’s becoming harder to run for Senate in a state that voted for the opposite party’s presidential nominee. In Democrats’ favor, however, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have succeeded at it before.
Vulnerable Democratic senators will try to distance themselves from Biden where they can or try to signal that they represent a check on the White House. For example, six of them (plus independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who caucuses with Democrats) recently joined a bipartisan call to the secretary of state to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets after Hamas’ attack on Israel – even though the administration has made clear that the money hasn’t been touched, has strict restrictions around it and the US hasn’t found a direct link between Iran and the Hamas attack.
It’s too early to say whether current events – especially abroad – could have any impact on elections that are still over a year away, but with the GOP-led House paralyzed without a speaker and Congress being called upon to approve aid to Israel and Ukraine, the moment has underscored how congressional contests have very real consequences.
Here’s where things stand in the race for the Senate just over a year before Election Day 2024:
1. West Virginia
Incumbent: Democrat Joe Manchin

West Virginia remains the seat most likely to change party hands next year, whatever Sen. Joe Manchin does. The most conservative Democrat in the Senate – who hasn’t ruled out running as an independent for reelection or for president – Manchin isn’t expected to announce his plans until the end of this year. He raised $715,000 in the July-to-September third quarter – enough to maintain appearances that he’ll be a candidate next year. The haul is also more than what either of his major GOP opponents raised but about half a million less than his previous quarter total. (The chances of this seat flipping only go up if Manchin declines to seek a third full term.)
Even if he runs without the “D” after his name, he’ll have an uphill battle in a state Trump won by 39 points in 2020. His vulnerability is apparent in the way GOP-affiliated ads are tying him to Biden and Democratic-aligned spots are tying him to Trump. One Nation, for example, has attacked him over his support of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, while Duty and Honor PAC has touted Manchin’s work with Trump to protect miners’ pensions.
The immediate fight, however, is the GOP primary, where Jim Justice, the popular Democrat-turned-Republican governor, has outraised Rep. Alex Mooney by about $300,000. While national Republicans and Trump are behind Justice, the Club for Growth and an allied super PAC have committed nearly $13.6 million to the House Freedom Caucus member. The club’s political arm is airing ads calling Justice a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, and trying to tie him to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.
2. Montana
Incumbent: Democrat Jon Tester
Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
Sen. Jon Tester, another red-state Democrat, is no stranger to tough races. But the most pressing question is whether GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale – fresh off his vote to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – decides to complicate national Republicans’ plans by mounting his own bid to avenge his 2018 loss to Tester. The NRSC likes retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who already has the backing of the two other members of Montana’s congressional delegation (including Daines, the NRSC chairman) and Gov. Greg Gianforte. Sheehy, who entered the race in July, raised $2.9 million in the most recent fundraising quarter (including about $653,000 in personal money), but he’s a relative newcomer. (The Minnesota native has taken heat, for example, for saying in a Breitbart News interview that there were more bears than people in Montana.)
Rosendale, too, has out-of-state roots, and his House campaign only brought in about $335,000 during the third quarter. But as a previous statewide candidate – he was elected state auditor in 2016 and lost to Tester by about 4 points in 2018 – he starts with more built-in name recognition than Sheehy and could potentially benefit from assistance from the Club for Growth. Sheehy has been on air trying to introduce himself, leaning heavily into his military service and using ranching motifs to highlight his ties to the state. He’s also been attacking Tester for not adhering to some of the commitments in an ethics pledge he ran on during his first campaign, as CNN’s KFile reported.
An outside group called Last Best Place PAC, seemingly linked to Democrats, is attacking Sheehy – a sign Democrats may think he’d be a tougher opponent than Rosendale. Tester appears to be taking the race seriously – he raised more than $5 million in the third quarter and ended September with $13 million.
3. Ohio
Incumbent: Democrat Sherrod Brown
Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is gearing up for a tough race in a state that’s been trending red over the past decade. (He raised $5.8 million in the third quarter, ending the period with $11.2 million.) He’ll need all the money he can get if he faces one of the two self-funders vying for the GOP nomination. Both businessman Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan loaned their campaigns $3 million in the third quarter. Secretary of State Frank LaRose – who raised about $1 million, including $250,000 he loaned his campaign – doesn’t have the same kinds of personal resources, but he likely starts with a name ID advantage as the only statewide elected official in the GOP race. He became the public face of an August ballot effort to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution – seen as a proxy fight over an upcoming November referendum on abortion rights. LaRose admitted the measure was effectively about abortion, so the effort’s failure has been a point of attack from his primary opponents.
Trump carried Ohio twice, and his backing proved instrumental in getting now-Sen. JD Vance over the finish line in last year’s Republican primary, which also featured Dolan and, briefly, Moreno. Vance is backing Moreno in this primary, and while Trump has praised Moreno, he hasn’t made any endorsement yet. The NRSC is so far staying neutral in this race. The candidates met for their first forum last weekend, where US aid to Ukraine was a point of divergence between Moreno – who, like Vance, wants to suspend it – and Dolan, who wants it to continue. (LaRose called for making aid contingent on securing the US southern border.)
Meanwhile, Brown has been on the picket line with striking United Auto Workers – underscoring the economic populist streak that Democrats hope will allow him to defy the political tilt of his state once again.
4. Pennsylvania
Incumbent: Democrat Bob Casey

The Keystone State moves up several spots this month largely because of how uniquely settled the GOP primary is compared with other battleground states. Republicans coalesced around Dave McCormick to take on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey soon after the former hedge fund executive got into the race in late September. (State Sen. Doug Mastriano announced in May that he was passing on a bid – a major relief for national Republicans who were wary of the failed 2022 gubernatorial candidate and election denier.)
But Democrats think McCormick, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat last year, has his own baggage. He tried to tack to the right in an effort to secure Trump’s endorsement and the GOP nomination in the 2022 Senate primary, which could alienate some suburban Philadelphia voters in a general election. He’s also facing questions about his residency. McCormick insists that he lives in Pennsylvania but returns to Connecticut to visit his daughter, who’s still in school there and lives with his ex-wife. “And if there’s a political cost associated with that, so be it,” he recently told ABC27’s “This Week in Pennsylvania.”
Still, the combination of McCormick and his vast personal resources during a presidential year are likely to make this Casey’s most competitive Senate race yet. The three-term incumbent, who raised $3.2 million in the third quarter, has a well-known political name in the state and enjoys a 48% job approval (and 31% disapproval) rating, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this month. He led McCormick 50% to 44% among registered voters in that survey, but this race is still young.
5. Arizona
Incumbent: Independent Kyrsten Sinema
Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images
Kari Lake – who embraced election denialism and conspiracy theories in her losing 2022 gubernatorial bid – was far from Republicans’ dream Senate candidate in this emerging purple state. But the former TV anchor is going to be hard to beat in a primary given her strong connection with the GOP base. Trump endorsed her by video at her announcement rally earlier this month, and there are signs that the party establishment is trying to keep her close. “We have not ruled out endorsing Lake,” a source familiar with the NRSC’s strategy told CNN. Daines has said the national party has had “productive conversations” with Lake, who recently told The Associated Press she’d vote for McConnell for leader. She’s also picked up the backing of Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso.
But Lake still won’t admit she lost last year’s gubernatorial race and her past hard-line positions on abortion could turn off swing voters. Her candidacy represents a familiar challenge for Arizona Republicans, whose recent nominees for key offices swung right in the primary and then struggled to pivot to the general election. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb is also running for Senate, but raised just $475,000 in the third quarter.
The race will remain unsettled, however, until Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party to become an independent last year, announces whether she’s running. Her $825,000 haul in the third quarter raised questions about her future, given that it was less than what she’s raised in the past. But Sinema still had more than $10 million in the bank as of September 30. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, meanwhile, outraised her yet again – bringing in $3.1 million last quarter – but had about half of her cash on hand.
6. Nevada
Incumbent: Democrat Jacky Rosen
Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images
Nevada is a slightly more Democratic state than most on this list, although that’s not saying much. It voted for Biden by about 2 points, so Democrats aren’t taking Sen. Jacky Rosen’s reelection for granted. She raised $2.7 million in the third quarter, ending with $8.8 million in the bank.
National Republicans have made clear their preference for retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, an unsuccessful 2022 Senate candidate who’s trying to tie Rosen to Biden and his economic policies. But that hasn’t winnowed the GOP field. Trump’s former ambassador to Iceland, Jeff Gunter, entered the race in August and has cut an ad that refers to him as “110% pro-Trump.” Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, who lost a GOP primary bid for lieutenant governor last year, also jumped into the race in August. Former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, an election denier and the losing 2022 GOP nominee for Nevada secretary of state, only raised $74,000 last quarter, compared with $1.2 million for Brown.
The primary isn’t until June, but Democrats are already seizing on what they see as vulnerabilities in Brown’s abortion positioning, including comments he made during a 2014 run for the Texas state legislature and his past work with the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition.
7. Wisconsin
Incumbent: Democrat Tammy Baldwin
Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters
Wisconsin slides down one spot on this list, in part because Republicans still don’t have a major candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. That doesn’t mean this race won’t eventually be very competitive in a battleground presidential state that swung from Trump to Biden in 2020.
Republicans are eyeing businessman and 2012 Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who would likely have the ability to self-fund. Baldwin raised $3.1 million during the third quarter and began October with about $6.9 million in the bank. This is one of the few states where presidential performance isn’t necessarily indicative of Senate race outcomes. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, for example, won a third term last year after Biden had carried the state, albeit by only about half a point, two years earlier.
8. Michigan
Incumbent: Democrat Debbie Stabenow (retiring)
Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images
Michigan is a bluer state than its Midwestern neighbor Wisconsin – Biden carried the Wolverine State by nearly 3 points and Democrats saw success up and down the ticket in 2022, in part because abortion was such a galvanizing issue. Democrats are now trying to ensure that retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s seat remains in their hands. Much of the party has coalesced around Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who raised nearly $3 million in the third quarter, although she does face primary challenges, including from actor Hill Harper, who raised about $559,000 and kicked in about $463,000 more of his own money.
Republicans landed a prominent recruit in former Rep. Mike Rogers, who succeeded Stabenow in the House and represented an earlier version of Slotkin’s Lansing-area seat for seven terms. Rogers, who raised $824,00 in the third quarter after entering the race in September, earned immediate praise from the NRSC as the “type of candidate who can perform well with suburban Michiganders.” And although the former House Intelligence chairman may use his recent absence from elected politics as a selling point, the GOP has changed a lot since he left Congress in 2015 – especially in Michigan, where the state party has a controversial new chair.
Since entering the race, Rogers has already landed a primary challenge from former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who was disqualified from last year’s governor’s race over signature issues. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who has formed an exploratory committee, could still run – although the one-term congressman isn’t likely to curry much favor with the GOP base after voting to impeach Trump in 2021.
9. Texas
Incumbent: Republican Ted Cruz
Alex Wong/Getty Images
Texas is a hard state for Democrats to flip – they haven’t won a statewide election here since 1994, their longest losing streak in the country. But GOP Sen. Ted Cruz makes a good villain for national Democrat donors. (See Beto O’Rourke’s massive 2018 fundraising hauls in his closer-than-expected loss to the senator.)
The question, however, is whether that grassroots Democratic opposition to Cruz can translate widely enough to deny him a third term. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who has already proved to be a strong fundraiser, brought in $4.7 million in the third quarter – more than Cruz’s $3.1 million. Democrats tout the former NFL player’s background as a good fit for Texas – he first won election to the House by flipping a GOP-held district in the Dallas area and has previously won support from the US Chamber of Commerce.
But although Allred already appears focused on Cruz, he’ll have to get through a crowded primary first. Among the other candidates is state Sen. Roland Guttierez, who represents Uvalde and raised $632,000 in the third quarter.
10. Florida
Incumbent: Republican Rick Scott
Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters
Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell announced her campaign to take on GOP Sen. Rick Scott in late August. Despite only being in the race for part of the third quarter, she narrowly outraised the first-term senator and former governor – $1.5 million to $1.4 million. Scott gave his campaign an additional $154,000 of his own money, and there’s plenty more where that came from for the wealthy former health care CEO.
Florida has been trending red in recent years – Trump carried the state by about 3 points in 2020, nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier. But each of Scott’s races for governor and Senate have been relatively close, and he’s never run in a presidential year. Democrats have targeted him over some of his more unpopular policy proposals – such as a sunset provision for all federal programs, which he later revised to exclude Social Security and Medicare after criticism from within his own party. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, for example, has been running digital ads casting Scott and Cruz as threats to popular entitlement programs.
Even with Democratic investment, though, it’s going to take a lot to flip this seat blue. The state’s senior senator, Republican Marco Rubio, won reelection last year over a high-profile Democratic opponent by 16 points.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/22/politics/senate-race-rankings-october-elections/index.html
35,Congress,2023,10,Lawsuit to block Trump from Colorado 2024 ballot survives more legal challenges,Marshall Cohen,"CNN
 — 
A judge has rejected three more attempts by former President Donald Trump and the Colorado GOP to shut down a lawsuit seeking to block him from the 2024 presidential ballot in the state based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.”
The flurry of rulings late Friday from Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace are a blow to Trump, who faces candidacy challenges in multiple states stemming from his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. He still has a pending motion to throw out the Colorado lawsuit, but the case now appears on track for an unprecedented trial this month.
A post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment says US officials who take an oath to uphold the Constitution are disqualified from future office if they “engaged in insurrection” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists. But the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban, and it has been applied only twice since the 1800s.
A liberal watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed the Colorado case on behalf of six Republican and unaffiliated voters. The judge is scheduled to preside over a trial beginning October 30 to decide a series of novel legal questions about how the 14th Amendment could apply to Trump.
In a 24-page ruling, Wallace rejected many of Trump’s arguments that the case was procedurally flawed and should be shut down. She said the key question of whether Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has the power to block Trump from the ballot based on the 14th Amendment “is a pivotal issue and one best reserved for trial.”
Wallace also swatted away arguments from the Colorado GOP that state law gives the party, not election officials, ultimate say on which candidates appear on the ballot.
“If the Party, without any oversight, can choose its preferred candidate, then it could theoretically nominate anyone regardless of their age, citizenship, residency,” she wrote. “Such an interpretation is absurd; the Constitution and its requirements for eligibility are not suggestions, left to the political parties to determine at their sole discretion.”
Wallace also cited a 2012 opinion from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, when he was a Denver-based appeals judge, which said states have the power to “exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.” She cited this while rejecting Trump’s claim that Colorado’s ballot access laws don’t give state officials any authority to disqualify him based on federal constitutional considerations.
Trump already lost an earlier bid to throw out the case on free-speech grounds.
The current GOP front-runner, Trump denies wrongdoing regarding January 6 and has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges stemming from his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. His campaign has said these lawsuits are pushing an “absurd conspiracy theory” and the challengers are “stretching the law beyond recognition.”
In a statement on Saturday, the Trump campaign criticized Wallace and her rulings, saying she “got it wrong.”
“She is going against the clear weight of legal authority. We are confident the rule of law will prevail, and this decision will be reversed – whether at the Colorado Supreme Court, or at the U.S. Supreme Court,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said. “To keep the leading candidate for President of the United States off the ballot is simply wrong and un-American.”
The 14th Amendment challenges in Colorado and other key states face an uphill climb, with many legal hurdles to clear before Trump would be disqualified from running for the presidency. Trump is sure to appeal any decision to strip him from the ballot, which means the Supreme Court and its conservative supermajority might get the final say.
In recent months, a growing and politically diverse array of legal scholars have thrown their support behind the idea that Trump is disqualified under the “insurrectionist ban.” The bipartisan House committee that investigated the January 6 attack recommended last year that Trump be barred from holding future office under the 14th Amendment.

36,Congress,2023,10,House remains paralyzed with no end in sight for speakership battle after Jordan’s exit,Clare Foran,"CNN
 — 
There is still no end in sight for the high-stakes speakership battle after House Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy more than two weeks ago.
The search is on for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race, and it’s already shaping up to be a crowded candidate field.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a speaker candidate, with the chamber effectively frozen amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and conflict unfolding abroad.
House Republicans are expected to hold a candidate forum Monday evening and more candidates are likely to throw their names into the running before then.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to remove McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day. The Ohio Republican fared worse in the vote than he had in previous failed rounds.
Here are some of the candidates now vying to become the next GOP speaker nominee:
Rep. Tom Emmer, who serves as majority whip, said in a letter to his colleagues shared on Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy is backing Emmer for speaker, sources tell CNN, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
Rep. Kevin Hern told CNN on Friday that “yes” he plans to run for speaker. When asked how he plans to get 217 votes, Hern said he’ll work “hard” to get people on his side.
Rep. Jack Bergman is running for the speaker role, his spokesman told CNN.
Rep. Austin Scott, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week, but quickly dropped out and then supported Jordan, is now running for speaker again now that the field is wide open, his spokesperson told CNN.
Rep. Byron Donalds, a Freedom Caucus member, announced on X that he’s seeking the speakership to advance a “conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American people.”
Rep. Mike Johnson, the House Republican conference vice chairman, also announced a run for speaker in a letter to his Republican colleagues Saturday, saying “after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

37,Congress,2023,10,"Appeals court upholds January 6 obstruction prosecution, in a ruling that could bolster case against Trump",Katelyn Polantz,"CNN
 — 
A federal appeals court has upheld the Justice Department’s ability to prosecute January 6, 2021, rioters with an obstruction charge, in a new opinion that is likely to bolster prosecutors’ criminal case against former President Donald Trump on the same charge.
The decision, issued Friday, means prosecutors can use the law that criminalizes obstructing an official proceeding as they seek to bring to justice rioters who disrupted the congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election.
The three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals split 2-1 in the decision.
Trump is scheduled to go to trial in his federal election subversion case in March. His attorneys are arguing to have the case against him dismissed.
The appeals court ruled in the case of Thomas Robertson, a former police sergeant from southern Virginia who was convicted for taking part in the US Capitol riot. Robertson had asked the courts to examine the use of the obstruction law in relation to the riot.
Robertson went into the Capitol after then-President Trump’s speech on the Ellipse, and he hit a police officer with a stick. Robertson was later found guilty of obstruction.
The latest on Donald Trump's many legal clouds
The mob violence at the Capitol complex prompted Congress to evacuate the House and Senate chambers, pausing their certification of Joe Biden’s Electoral College win – a development that is a key factor of the DOJ’s obstruction cases against rioters.
Robertson argued in court that he shouldn’t face the obstruction charge because he hadn’t been acting corruptly, as the law requires. He also argued the law was too vague and was unconstitutional.
But the Friday ruling solidifies that his conviction and others like it can stand. In Robertson’s case, the court found he had broken the law in multiple ways, making it clear he acted corruptly.
“Where a defendant acts feloniously to obstruct a proceeding before the Congress, with no evidence or argument that he was merely engaged in peaceful expression, his culpability – i.e., the ‘corruptness’ of his actions – is not difficult to discern,” Judge Florence Pan of the DC Circuit wrote in the opinion.
Judge Nina Pillard agreed with the decision, while Judge Karen Henderson dissented.
Trump is separately charged under the same obstruction law and has pleaded not guilty. Trump is not personally accused of violence, as many rioters like Robertson were, and instead is accused of exploiting the Capitol riot as to derail the presidential transfer of power.",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/politics/capitol-riot-obstruction-appeals-ruling/index.html

 — 
It’s been 17 days since eight Republicans were able to bounce former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the top position in Congress and hit pause on all legislative business on Capitol Hill.
Having moved on from McCarthy and his No. 2, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third Republican choice, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, failed again Friday to perform the magic trick of uniting nearly every Republican behind him to get a House majority and reopen the chamber.
Jordan, by the way, was once labeled by a Republican former speaker as among a group of “political terrorists” for the way he thought they worked to tear apart Washington.
If Jordan ultimately can’t get enough Republican votes, some Republicans could join with some Democrats behind a separate option – giving interim Speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina temporary power to pass legislation.
Here’s a look at what we know and what we can expect:
Why does it matter that there’s no speaker?
The House is essentially paralyzed until someone is chosen to preside over it.
A placeholder, McHenry, has the power to bring the chamber to order. But no legislation can pass until this is resolved. No government funding bills. No policy bills. To the extent that Congress is meant to address problems with legislation, that is not happening.
What legislation needs to pass and when?
First and foremost, the government essentially runs out of money in less than a month, on November 17. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
There is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel after it was attacked by Hamas this month. And Ukraine is said to be running out of munitions, although support has dropped in Congress for continued aid to Kyiv.
President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Ukraine and Israel.
What happened to the last speaker?
McCarthy was one of the shortest-serving speakers in US history. In order to get the job in January, he agreed to give any single Republican member the power to call for a vote to “vacate” him from the top spot.
That was his undoing. Far-right members were frustrated that McCarthy relied on Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill and avoid a government shutdown late last month.

McCarthy’s replacement will now have a month to tackle the larger problem of a yearlong spending bill before the government again faces the prospect of a funding lapse.
Does Jordan have momentum?
Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary, was chosen last week as the Republican nominee to be speaker. He got the support of a majority of Republicans in a secret ballot vote but not enough to become speaker. He’s lost three separate votes before the full House.
He can only afford to lose three GOP votes on the floor, but opposition to him appears to be growing, not shrinking.
Why is Jordan controversial?
A founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus, Jordan made his name as somewhat of a flamethrower on Capitol Hill. A 2020 election skeptic, Jordan was among former President Donald Trump’s most vocal defenders in Congress, fealty Trump rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in his final days in office.
The most important thing to know about Jim Jordan
That such a conservative lawmaker would be elevated to the top spot in the House speaks volumes about how the GOP has evolved in the age of Trump. Jordan earned Trump’s endorsement earlier this month when it was a two-way race with Scalise.
Jordan has also faced scrutiny over his position as assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University at the time that a team doctor, Richard Strauss, was sexually abusing male students. Some of the abused have publicly argued Jordan heard and ignored their complaints in the 1990s. The Ohio Republican has vehemently denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of the abuse. CNN reported on the issue in 2020.
Who once said Jordan was one of the ‘political terrorists’?
Jordan is among the conservative members whom one former speaker, retired Rep. John Boehner, described as “political terrorists” in his memoir.
“I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart – never building anything, never putting anything together,” Boehner told CBS News of Jordan in 2021.

Jordan told CNN’s Manu Raju he can unite the party.
“I think we are a conservative-center-right party. I think I’m the guy who can help unite that. My politics are entirely consistent with where conservatives and Republicans are across the country,” he said.
Jordan has used his position as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to begin investigations into special counsel Jack Smith and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who are both prosecuting Trump.
What is the math?
There are 221 Republicans and 212 Democrats in the House. Subtracting two vacant seats plus any absences from the normal total of 435 members means 217 or potentially fewer is the current threshold for a majority.
Democrats are unified behind their leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York.
What happens if no candidate gets a majority?
They vote again. And again. And again, until either one candidate gets a majority or there is a recess.
If this sounds familiar that’s because it took McCarthy 15 rounds of voting and multiple days to build a majority of Republicans in January.
What happens during the vote?
The clerk of the House will gavel in the chamber and call a quorum. Democrats will place Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans will nominate Jordan.
Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot.
Are members required to vote for either Jeffries or Jordan?
There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.
Is there an alternative to Jordan for Republicans?
Not at the moment, but it’s important to note that Jordan is far from their first choice. All but eight Republicans had backed keeping McCarthy, but because Republicans’ majority is so small, he lost his job.
Then, Republicans nominated Scalise, the House majority leader. But Scalise was far from a universal choice, and rather than work to change the minds of his doubters by horse-trading for their votes, the Louisiana Republican withdrew his name from contention.
Anyone will face a difficult task in unifying a party that includes far-right members such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who engineered McCarthy’s ouster, as well as 18 members who represent districts that would have voted for Biden in 2020 under redrawn lines.
Will Republicans revisit the ‘motion to vacate’ rule?
It was McCarthy’s decision to give any Republican the power to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. There are voices in both parties who want to see that power controlled. A majority could change the rules Republicans adopted in January.
Jordan has not taken an official position but made clear the first order of business is selecting a speaker. They can revisit whether a speaker should be removed at a later date.
What about the temporary speaker option?
This makes a lot of sense to a lot of moderates. Giving McHenry power until the end of November or the end of the year would allow lawmakers to pass government funding bills and give Republicans a chance to figure out who their leader should be.
Democrats have indicated they are open to helping the plan get the majority vote it would need. But details can be difficult. Many Republicans oppose the perception of working with Democrats in a sort-of coalition government. Democrats have not entirely endorsed the plan.
It’s been 100 years
In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 15 times, according to the House historian.
All but two of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.
Until it took McCarthy 15 ballots in January, a floor fight had taken place only once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.
The epic record for a floor fight
In 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.
The process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders, who answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.
It’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.

39,Congress,2023,10,Democratic divisions over Israel heat up over Gaza hospital blast controversy,Gregory Krieg,"CNN
 — 
Democrats on Capitol Hill are furious over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s refusal to retract or add new context to her statements blaming Israel for the deadly blast that devastated a Gaza hospital, killing hundreds of people and setting off a regional backlash against the US and Israel.
Tlaib’s initial social media posts reflected the early Hamas-sourced reports out of Gaza. But those reports are now at odds with initial American intelligence, which subsequently concluded that the Israel Defense Forces were not responsible for the explosion.
The dispute has laid bare long-standing and increasingly passionate disagreements among congressional Democrats over the party’s relationship with Israel – and, now, how to position the party as the deadly conflict in Israel and Gaza escalates.
Mainstream Democrats, led by President Joe Biden, continue to insist on staunch support for Israel, while some progressive House members are becoming more insistent that the US aggressively push for a ceasefire and hold Israel accountable for alleged war crimes against Palestinians. And within the progressive bloc too, high-profile members such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have occasionally diverged, at least rhetorically, from their ideological allies and have spoken in more cautious, conciliatory tones. The political director for Rep. Ro Khanna, another influential progressive, resigned because the California Democrat did not sign a resolution calling for a ceasefire.
Polls show Americans agree with Biden on US foreign policy on Israel
Tlaib, a Palestinian American and a longtime advocate for Palestinian rights, has been the most outspoken critic of Israel in Congress since her election in 2018. Her insistence on blaming Israel for the blast, which the US believes was struck by an errant rocket launched by extremist group Islamic Jihad, has roiled colleagues determined to present a united front at a harrowing time.
“That’s a vile position to take,” Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN, suggesting that Tlaib should review intelligence made available to House members. “She should at least pull those tweets down, instead of remaining entrenched in a position that is dangerous and unacceptable.”
Democrats have mostly been measured in their public comments about Tlaib, expressing frustration with her unyielding position in light of the conflicting reports and new evidence that Israel was not responsible for the hospital blast while also blaming the media over its coverage of the tragedy.
“When Israel makes statements, they have to show satellite imagery and all sorts of video. But when Hamas says something, the entire media world ran with it.” Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz said. “It caused riots in all sorts of countries. It caused meetings to be canceled for the president. And so everyone has to be careful before they just react, and wait for things to be confirmed.”
But the effort to project unity could soon become untenable – and the divisions are becoming more personal.
According to a source with knowledge of the complaints, some Jewish Democrats have privately complained to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ team about comments from Tlaib and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who initially echoed reports blaming Israel for the hospital attack before posting additional context about the hospital explosion and acknowledging the US intelligence assessment. (Jeffries has embraced the US and Israeli intelligence conclusions and a spokesperson said in a statement that Jeffries, like Biden, backs Israel’s “unequivocal right to defend itself against Hamas under the established rules of war and strongly disagrees with any effort to blame President Joe Biden or the policies of his administration.”)
Tlaib’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the matter, but the Michigan Democrat appeared at a Wednesday rally on Capitol Hill and continued to blame Israel.
“That’s what’s been really painful – just continue to watch people think it’s OK to bomb a hospital, where children,” Tlaib said. “What’s so hard sometimes is watching those videos and the people telling the kids, ‘Don’t cry.’ But like, let them cry. And they’re shaking, and somebody – you know this – they keep telling them not to cry in Arabic. They can cry, I can cry, we all can cry. If we’re not crying, something is wrong.”
State Department official resigns over Biden administration's handling of Israel-Hamas conflict
“People are furious,” one House Democrat told CNN about the reaction to Tlaib’s comments. “The intelligence that we’ve received is clear. Do you believe Hamas’ intel or do you believe the United States’ intelligence?”
There’s now a push among some House Democrats to convince Tlaib to get an intelligence briefing on the hospital strike, according to the source.
Another House Democrat felt that Tlaib’s comments were frustrating but not entirely unexpected and that her colleagues are taking different approaches to addressing them. Some have been speaking out publicly while others are giving Tlaib space to walk back her comments.
Some Democrats pointed to a social media post by Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman as summing up the way a lot of them are feeling right now.
“It’s truly disturbing that Members of Congress rushed to blame Israel for the hospital tragedy in Gaza,” Fetterman wrote. ” Who would take the word of a group that just massacred innocent Israeli citizens over our key ally?”
Another Democratic aide, though, argued that the pushback against Tlaib and Omar undermined the Democratic Party’s brand.
“Part of being a ‘diversity party’ and a ‘big tent party’ includes bringing new voices who have been marginalized into the party,” the aide said. “And Muslim Americans have been some of the most marginalized people in American life for the past two decades.”
“No one in Congress is denying the horror of Hamas or the horror of the thousands of Israelis killed and the largest attack on Jews since the Holocaust,” the aide said, adding that the frustration among Muslim Americans – and some Jewish Americans – lies in “one side with very little political power receiving all of the outrage.”
Former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, downplayed the discord in the caucus.
Senate passes bipartisan resolution affirming support for Israel
“Name me more than four people,” Hoyer told CNN, in an apparent reference to the original “squad” of Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “Do we have some people that have a different view? We do. But it’s not the position of the party.”
But the ranks of the dissenters have grown since then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi first offered a similarly dismissive assessment of the squad members in 2019. Progressives now make up a growing share of the House Democratic Caucus. More than a dozen Democratic members have so far publicly called for a ceasefire, including those who signed a proposed resolution by Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, a newer squad member.
“I am grieving for every Palestinian, Israeli, and American life lost to this violence, and my heart breaks for all those who will be forever traumatized because of it,” Bush said in an accompanying statement. “War and retaliatory violence doesn’t achieve accountability or justice; it only leads to more death and human suffering.”",https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/20/politics/democrats-divisions-israel-gaza-hospital-tlaib/index.html
40,Congress,2023,10,Biden makes the case for wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine in primetime address,Betsy Klein,"CNN
 — 
President Joe Biden tied the wars in Ukraine and Israel together during a primetime Oval Office address Thursday, making an impassioned appeal to the American people to support two fellow democracies that he says are facing existential threats.
The president has often cast this moment in history as an “inflection point” – a battle between the world’s democracies and autocracies. On Thursday, he argued that “this is one of those moments,” making a direct appeal to the American people as he sought to build support for US funding for wars abroad that could face a challenging path in Congress, where the House of Representatives remains unable to pass legislation in its second week without a speaker.
“Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it,” Biden said.
“We can’t let petty partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen,” he added.”
He laid out the stakes for the American people, calling the wars a national security imperative and a critical moment for the future of American leadership and democracies worldwide.
“American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us in America safe. American values are what make us a partner nation you want to work with,” he said. “To put all that at risk – we walk away from Ukraine, we turn our backs on Israel – it’s just not worth it.”
The president said support for both wars is “vital for America’s national security.”
“History has taught us that when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going. And the cost and the threat to America in the world keep rising,” Biden said, warning, “If we don’t stop Putin’s appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won’t limit himself just to Ukraine.”
And he warned more broadly that the United States’ adversaries and competitors “are watching.”
“If we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine’s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same. The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world – in the Indo Pacific, in the Middle East, especially in the Middle East,” Biden said.
A request for more funding
The primetime address took place on the eve of the White House requesting north of $100 billion from Congress to deliver aid and resources to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the US border with Mexico, even though the legislative branch is paralyzed by the dysfunction in the House of Representatives.
The administration has informed lawmakers it plans to seek $14 billion for border security in its new funding package, a marked increase from the previous ask, according to a source familiar. The administration previously asked for $4 billion in supplemental funding to address needs on the US-Mexico border. The new ask encompasses fiscal year 2024, which is why it’s higher than the supplemental request submitted by the White House over the summer, according to another source familiar.
Biden said he would be submitting an “urgent budget request” for supplemental funding for Israel and Ukraine, among other national security priorities.
“That’s why tomorrow I’m going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America’s national security needs – needs to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine. It’s a smart investment that’s gonna pay dividends for American security for generations,” Biden said.
While the White House believes there remains broad bipartisan support in Congress for the package, as three administration officials told CNN, real questions remain about the path for such a package with a leadership vacuum in the House of Representatives and consternation about federal spending levels that have cast into question the government’s ability to fund itself beyond mid-November.
The Biden administration in August delivered its last so-called supplemental funding request, which encapsulates unique requests beyond traditional government programs. The proposal requested $24.1 billion to aid Ukraine through the end of the year, but Congress failed to approve it during a process to greenlight short-term federal funding.
Biden reiterated that he will not put American boots on the ground in Ukraine.
“I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine. All Ukraine is asking for is help. For the weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability of pushing invading Russian forces off their land and the air defense system to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities,” he said.
As public opinion toward military aid provision for Ukraine has waned in the last year, Biden also sought to explain the process, tying it to American jobs.
“We send Ukrainian equipment sitting in our stockpiles. And when we use the money allocated by Congress, we use it to replenish our own stores, our own stockpiles, with new equipment. Equipment that defends America and is made in America,” he said, pointing to Patriot missiles for air defense batteries that are made in Arizona and artillery shells that are manufactured in 12 states across the country, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas.
“Just as in World War II, today, patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom,” he said.
Public opinion regarding US assistance has been mixed.
In a recent CNN poll, nearly all respondents were sympathetic with the Israeli people in the wake of surprise attacks launched by Hamas, but there was no clear consensus on the right level of US involvement. One-third (35%) said the US is providing the right amount of assistance – and another 36% were unsure whether the level of US assistance is appropriate. The US has long provided security assistance to Israel, which receives roughly $4 billion annually under a 10-year memorandum of understanding. The new request would provide billions more.
Israel-Hamas war rages as crisis in Gaza deepens
By contrast, support to sustain aid to Ukraine has waned significantly since Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February 2022. An August CNN poll found 55% of respondents said Congress should not pass more funding to aid Ukraine. The partisan divide has been deepening, too: Nearly three-quarters of Republicans opposed more funding for Ukraine, while 62% of Democrats supported it.
Since Russia’s invasion, the White House and Congress have provided more than $75 billion in funding to Kyiv, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
Speech comes after high-profile visit
The speech comes on the heels of his wartime visit to the Middle East, which went on even after a blast tore through a hospital in Gaza. While his planned stop in Amman, Jordan, to meet Arab leaders was canceled just as the president was preparing to depart the White House, Biden did spend hours on the ground in Tel Aviv.
For Biden, a trip in the formative days of a potentially drawn-out conflict amounted to the ultimate test of his confidence – built over decades – that getting in the same room can influence people and events.
During the speech, the president reflected on the visit, which included a meeting that stretched well past what officials had expected, in which Biden sought to use his decades-long relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – one that has endured significant strain over the past year – to offer advice and seek commitments on the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
“The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others. In Israel, I saw people who are strong, determined, resilient and also angry, in shock and in deep, deep pain,” he said.
He reiterated his support for Americans being held hostage by Hamas.
“As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we’re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As president, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage,” he said.
He also pointed to an agreement securing “sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians, from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” warning Hamas against diverting or stealing the shipments.
The US, Egypt and Israel have all signaled readiness for aid to begin moving into Gaza, following Biden’s high-profile visit. However, the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza is not expected to open Friday for a convoy of humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, multiple sources told CNN, despite expectations voiced by Biden and others that it would be open.
“I would not put money on those trucks going through tomorrow,” one source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
During his address, Biden sought to draw a clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people and argued for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
“Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them,” he said.
The US, he later added, “remains committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away.”
Biden empathizes with both Muslims and Jews
During Biden’s speech, he spoke out forcefully against both Islamophobia and antisemitism, both of which have intensified in recent days, offering comfort and condemnation.
Biden acknowledged the fear from Jewish families “worried about being targeted in school, wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street, or going out about their daily life.”
And he empathized with Muslim Americans who are “outraged… saying to yourself, ‘Here we go again, with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.’”
“We can’t stand by and stand silent where this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must, also without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia,” he said.
Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden spoke Thursday evening with the father and uncle of Wadea Al-Fayoume, the Palestinian American boy stabbed to death in Illinois on Saturday.
The Bidens “expressed their deepest condolences to the ( Al-Fayoume) family as they mourn; their prayers that Wadea’s mother, Hannan Shahin, makes a full recovery; and their commitment to keep speaking out against anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim hate and violence,” the White House said.
Biden invoked the Al-Fayoume family in his Oval Office address.
“Just last week, a mother was brutally stabbed. A little boy – here in the United States – a little boy who just turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago. His name was Wadea, Wadea. A proud American, a proud Palestinian-American family,” Biden said.
He offered a message of recognition to those impacted: “To all of you hurting, those of you hurting, I want you to know I see you. You belong. I want to say this to you: You’re all American.”
“In moments like these, and when fears and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, we have to work harder than ever to hold onto the values that make us who we are,” he said.
While he said that Americans should not “forget who we are,” he also warned that the government of Israel should not “be blinded by rage.”
The message – tinged with hard-learned lessons from life in the United States after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – echoed thoughts Biden shared with Israelis while in Tel Aviv the day before.
“I caution this: While you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it,” Biden told his audience, a collection of Israelis and Americans.
“I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership,” Biden went on, recalling mistakes the United States made after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “There’s always cost, but it requires being deliberate, requires asking very hard questions. That requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you’re on will achieve those objectives.”

Calling Vice President Kamala Harris “a liar,” former President Donald Trump claimed that he never wanted to terminate the Affordable Care Act – an accusation Harris has repeatedly levied against him on the campaign trail.
“Lyin’ Kamala is giving a News Conference now, saying that I want to end the Affordable Care Act. I never mentioned doing that, never even thought about such a thing,” the former president posted on X Thursday.
Facts First: Trump is trying to rewrite history. Repealing and replacing the landmark health reform law, popularly known as Obamacare, was among his top campaign promises when he first ran for president in 2016, and he spent the initial months of his term pushing Congress to pass legislation to do just that. Trump revived the idea early in the current campaign before backtracking. At September’s presidential debate with Harris, he called the Affordable Care Act “lousy” and said “we” are working on “things” to replace it.
Even before he ran for office, Trump was crusading on Twitter, now known as X, to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama.
During his 2016 campaign, he promised supporters that he would quickly dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Within hours of taking office in January 2017, he issued an executive order aimed at rolling back the law.
After the GOP-led House of Representatives passed a repeal bill in May 2017, Trump called them to the White House for a celebratory appearance and said Obamacare was “essentially dead.”
“This is a great plan. I actually think it will get even better. This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it,” Trump said.
However, even though Republicans controlled Congress and the White House that year, they failed to unite behind a plan to do so, ending any serious attempts to completely jettison the Affordable Care Act. Trump spent the rest of his term chipping away at the law.
The former president revived the debate over the law’s fate in November 2023, when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he’s “seriously looking at alternatives” and that the failure to terminate it “was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!”
Trump has recently tried to change his tack – promising to come up with a health care plan that’s better.
“What we will do is we’re looking at different plans,” Trump said at September’s debate, noting that he had “concepts of a plan.”
“If we can come up with a plan that’s going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. But until then, I’d run it as good as it can be run,” he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/31/politics/aca-trump-repeal-affordable-care-act/index.html

CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump is on a lying spree.
As Election Day draws nearer, the Republican presidential nominee has made false claim after false claim on a dizzying variety of subjects. He has both come up with new falsehoods on pressing issues, most notably the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and repeated old favorites about subjects he has been railing about since his 2016 presidential campaign.
We went through the speeches Trump made at his two Wednesday campaign rallies in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, one in Scranton and one in Reading. In those two addresses alone, he uttered at least 40 separate false claims.
Here is a fact check.
FEMA and migrants: Trump falsely claimed of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: “They have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.” He also said, “They spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care…”
This is false in two ways. FEMA does have money for the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fund had about $11 billion remaining as of Wednesday. And FEMA did not give all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.
FEMA and employees: Trump added another false claim about FEMA, saying: “They have no workers, they have no nothing.” FEMA has more than 20,000 employees.
Harris and the response: Trump falsely claimed that as desperate people tried to survive Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris “didn’t send anything or anyone at all” to help them. There were extensive federal and state rescue and relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. It’s true that some residents died and others were stranded for days, but the state was not ignored by Harris or the Biden administration; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has repeatedly thanked President Joe Biden for his assistance.
Schools and transgender children: Trump told a slightly vaguer version of his usual false story about schools supposedly obtaining or performing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender children behind their parents’ backs, saying, “Your child go goes to school, and they take your child. It was a ‘he.’ And comes back a ‘she.’ And they do this…And often without parental consent.”
There is no evidence that US schools have sent children into gender-affirming surgeries without their parents knowing or performed gender-affirming surgeries on site; Trump’s own presidential campaign could not provide a single example of any of this ever happening. Even in states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under age 18, parental consent is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.
Trump’s opponents and the election: In Reading, Trump falsely claimed of his election opponents: “They are cheatin’ dogs, I will tell you that.” In Scranton, he falsely claimed, “Their first meeting is: ‘How do we cheat?’” This is all nonsense. There is no basis for the claim that Trump’s opponents are election cheaters.
Harris’ previous presidential campaign: Trump repeated his false claim that, when Harris ran for president in 2020, “she was the first one to drop out, of like 22 people” in the Democratic primary. In fact, 13 other Democratic candidates dropped out of that primary before Harris exited in December 2019 – including the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City; and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate.
Harris and the press: Trump falsely claimed of Harris: “She doesn’t do any interviews.” Trump is entitled to argue that Harris has not done a sufficient number of interviews as the Democratic presidential nominee, but the assertion she doesn’t do “any” is wrong; Harris has done multiple interviews in recent weeks. Notably, Harris did an interview with the CBS News show “60 Minutes,” which aired Monday, while Trump backed out of his own interview with the show.
Harris-Walz and the Supreme Court: After correctly noting that Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently expressed support for getting rid of the Electoral College, Trump falsely claimed, “They want to add… they’re thinking about – first time I heard this number – 25: they want to have 25 Supreme Court justices.” There is no basis for the claim that Harris or Walz is pushing for a 25-justice Supreme Court.
Walz and menstrual products in schools: Trump disparaged Walz as “Tampon Tim,” then said, “You know why they call him that? ’Cause they sell tampons, with special legislation, in boys’ locker rooms.” Trump’s claim is false. The law Walz signed in 2023 requires schools to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms, not the sale of menstrual products in locker rooms – and all 18 public school districts that responded to CNN’s questions about the law say they do not provide the products in boys’ bathrooms. You can read more here.
Wind power: Trump repeated a familiar nonsensical story about how the use of wind power means people “can’t watch” television if “there’s no wind tonight.” Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages when the wind isn’t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explained on its website even during the Trump administration.
The Biden administration and electric vehicles: Trump falsely claimed that under a Biden administration electric vehicle mandate, “everybody’s got to have an electric car almost immediately.” There is no Biden administration requirement that consumers must buy an electric car or give up their existing gas-powered cars, “almost immediately” or otherwise. The Biden administration has made a push to get automakers to reduce emissions and adopt electric vehicles, but there is not a mandate for consumers; the tailpipe rules for automakers that were unveiled by the administration earlier this year aim to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% new vehicles sold in 2032.
The Paris climate accord and emissions: Trump repeated his false claim that under the Paris climate accord, the US “had to pay a trillion dollars” while some other countries didn’t have to pay.
Trump’s “trillion” figure is a wild exaggeration. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to the global finance goal. And while Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually from the US, this level of funding hasn’t materialized. That’s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation’s budget, has allocated only a fraction of that – roughly $1 billion in 2022. 
Harris’ comments on fracking: Trump said, “Listen to Kamala in her own words very recently,” then played two video clips in which Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking. But those clips are from 2019, beyond any reasonable definition of “very recently.” Harris has said during the 2024 campaign that she no longer favors banning fracking.
Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falsely claimed, “In Venezuela, many countries, they’re emptying their prisons into our country.” This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone “many countries,” and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no evidence for it.
“We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.  
Venezuela, criminals and migration: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falsely claimed that “they take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.” This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.
The world prison population: Trump repeated his false claim that “the prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.” The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about 10.77 million people to at least about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
“I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.
The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, falsely claimed that “21 million people – plus – came into our nation” under the Biden-Harris administration. Through August, the country had recorded about 10.3 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called “gotaways” who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there’s no way the total is “21 million.”
Harris, migrants and criminals: Trump, criticizing Harris on immigration, again wrongly described a set of statistics that was released in September. He falsely claimed in Scranton, “You saw that last week: 13,099 murderers allowed to come in, through them.” He falsely claimed in Reading that “as we speak she has – and this was just announced last week – 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers, roaming free in our country.”
This 13,099 figure includes people who are incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails – and it includes people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s administration, not just under Biden and Harris. You can read more here.
Harris’ record as attorney general: Trump falsely claimed that when Harris was attorney general of California, “she said under no circumstances” will people be prosecuted for the crimes of child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon or the rape of an unconscious person. Harris did not say anything like that; Trump was grossly mischaracterizing a debate over the language Harris’ office used to summarize California ballot initiatives.
Trump’s border wall: Trump repeated his false claim that “I built over 500 miles of wall” on the southern border. Official government data shows 458 miles were built under Trump – including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.
Trump’s crowds: Trump falsely claimed of his rallies: “We never have an empty seat.” There have been empty seats at numerous Trump rallies over the years – including hundreds at this very rally in Reading. And at many Trump rallies, some once-filled seats empty out during his speeches when supporters leave.
Trump’s crowd in Butler: Trump falsely claimed there were “over 100,000 people” at the rally he held Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, at the same site where a gunman had attempted to assassinate him in July. CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburgh reported that the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott, said in his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at “21,000-plus people.”
Trump’s response to the assassination attempt: Trump, speaking of his response to the attempted assassination in July, falsely claimed, “I said as I was getting up – before I even got up – I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ Because, you know, it was wall to wall people, and I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ They said, ‘We think three, sir,’ and I said, ‘That’s not good.’”
Trump’s rally microphone picked up what was said by Trump and Secret Service agents while he was on the ground and just after, and he did not ask, before or after he got up, how many people were killed. It’s possible he did so after he was whisked off stage (and, of course, possible he was genuinely misremembering what happened in such a traumatic moment).
Trump and firefighters: Trump falsely claimed, “We got the firefighters endorse us, you probably heard.” But the actual recent national news was that the International Association of Firefighters had decided not to endorse any candidate in the race; while Trump is free to argue that this was a victory for him, given that the union endorsed Biden in 2020, it was not an actual endorsement. And while there were some people in the Scranton crowd holding “Scranton Firefighters for Trump” signs, the Scranton chapter of the union also has not issued an endorsement. The president of the chapter told the Scranton Times-Tribune that none of the people he saw holding the signs were active or retired local firefighters.
Trump and classified documents: Speaking of the criminal case against him over his post-presidency retention of classified documents, Trump repeated his false claim that “I had the Presidential Records Act; I was totally allowed to do it.” The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration. (Trump’s case was dismissed by a federal judge in July on other grounds, that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional; Smith has appealed.)
The New York Times and the Russia investigation: Trump, calling claims about his 2016 campaign’s connections to Russia a “scam,” repeated his false claim that The New York Times “admitted they were wrong” about the coverage that won its journalists a Pulitzer Prize along with journalists from The Washington Post.
“The claim is completely false,” Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email to CNN in 2023, when Trump made a similar claim; Stadtlander noted that “the award was upheld by the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review” and said the Times’ reporting “was also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.”
The New York Times and the 2016 election: Trump repeated a false claim he made during his presidency, saying of The New York Times’ coverage of the 2016 election: “Remember in 2016 they had to do an editorial apologizing to their readers because they said, ‘He’s going to lose’…and then I won?”
As the Times noted in 2017 in response to such Trump claims, it did not apologize for its 2016 election coverage. It did publish a post-election letter, from then-executive editor Dean Baquet and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., that said the election had raised several questions, including this: “Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?” But the letter did not include an apology, to Trump or anyone else.
Trump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that “we defeated ISIS in four weeks; it was supposed to take four or five years.” The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.
Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trump repeated his false claim that “we gave $85 billion worth” of US military equipment to the Taliban. Trump’s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon has estimated that the equipment abandoned to the Taliban by Afghan forces upon their 2021 collapse was worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.
Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his false claim that “Biden got a lot of money from China.” After years of investigation by House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any Chinese money.
Chris Wallace and a question about the Biden family: Trump told his familiar false story about how he had asked Biden at a 2020 presidential debate why the wife of a mayor of Moscow had paid Biden $3.5 million – in fact, the money was sent to a firm connected to the president’s son Hunter Biden, not to the president – but moderator Chris Wallace, then of Fox News and now of CNN, had interjected to say, “Well, please don’t ask him that question.” Wallace never did that. As the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer Trump’s question about the payment, not to stop Trump from asking.
Inflation: Trump repeated his false claim that inflation under Biden and Harris is “the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could fairly say that the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920, and the rate has since plummeted; the most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was 2.5% in August.
Mortgage rates: Trump falsely claimed that young people can’t buy a house because interest rates are higher than 10%: “It’s not 10%, it’s 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent.” This is false. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.12% in the week ending October 3, according to mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac, and 6.32% in the week ending October 10.
Trump’s tax cut: Trump repeated his false claim that “I gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country.” Expert analyses have found that his 2017 tax cut law was not the largest in US history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.
Tariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falsely claimed that China “paid hundreds of billions of dollars” in these tariffs during his presidency, then falsely claimed that before his presidency, “nobody ever brought in 10 cents, not one other – not 10 cents, you check those records.”
We’ve checked, and the truth is that the US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs.
The 1890s and tariffs: Touting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump falsely claimed that in the 1890s, when the US had very high tariffs, “Our country was the richest it ever was.” The US is far richer today than in the 1890s; per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.
The trade deficit with China: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that the US trade deficit with China has averaged “$500 billion” per year. The US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China; the all-time record, about $418 billion, was set under Trump in 2018.
Harris and taxes: Trump played a deceptively edited video showing “The View” co-host Meghan McCain saying to Harris in 2019, “Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate,” and Harris responding, “I think that’s fantastic.”
This video cuts out key words from the exchange; Harris was not specifically endorsing high tax rates when she made the “fantastic” comment.
Here’s the transcript of the 2019 exchange:
McCain: “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on ‘60 Minutes’ this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she’s promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly – and this ideology, of the socialist left – could splinter your party?”
Harris: “No. You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that’s fantastic. I think that – you know, I used to teach, before, especially before – in the last few years – and the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Is it – does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it’s good for the party, I frankly think it’s good for the country. Let’s look at the bold ideas. And I’m eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend status quo, then do it, and if there are – you know, if there’s not merit to that, then let’s explore new ideas.”
Biden’s documents case: Trump falsely claimed in Reading that, in an investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents, “Biden was essentially convicted” and in Scranton that “they ruled on him, they said he’s guilty.” Biden was not convicted, “essentially” or not, and was not found guilty; in fact, Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel in the case, Robert Hur, wrote in his public report that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” adding that “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.”
A supposed Biden gaffe: Mocking Biden’s gaffes, Trump falsely claimed, “But the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, ‘It’s great to be in Florida.’ That’s palm trees.” This never happened. Biden has certainly made various geographic gaffes, as has Trump, but he never said he was in Florida when he was actually in New Hampshire.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/10/politics/fact-check-trump-pennsylvania-speeches/index.html
43,Fact Check,2024,10,Fact check: Trump makes at least 11 false claims in foreign policy interview,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump did a Monday interview focused on foreign policy. And he repeated a bunch of his regular false claims on that subject and others – while sprinkling in some new inaccuracy for good measure – making at least 11 false claims in all.
In the interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Trump also made an assertion that he has been to Gaza. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted to CNN that the claim is true, but she could not provide a single detail about Trump’s supposed Gaza visit, and CNN and other media outlets have found no evidence that Trump ever went; he certainly did not go as president. You can read more here.
Below is a quick fact check of Trump’s 11 provably false claims in the interview.
Terrorist attacks: Trump repeated his false claim that “we didn’t have one terrorist attack” during his presidency. There were multiple terrorist attacks during his presidency, including some he has spoken about himself.
The defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that although others said it would take years to “get rid of” the ISIS terror group, “I got rid of it in a month.” Leaving aside the fact that Trump certainly doesn’t deserve sole credit, the ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.
Iran and funding for terror groups: Trump repeated his false claim that Iran did not fund terror groups during his presidency: “They weren’t giving any money, because they had no money.” Iran’s funding for entities designated by the US government as terror groups, like Hezbollah and Hamas, did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped – as Trump’s own administration acknowledged in 2020.
China’s oil purchases from Iran: Trump repeated his false claim that he successfully pressured Chinese leader Xi Jinping into ending oil purchases from Iran; Trump claimed, “He said, ‘I’ll pass.’ He passed. Everybody passed. They did no business.” China’s oil purchases from Iran briefly plummeted in 2019, but they never stopped, and they quickly rebounded while Trump was still president – back up to hundreds of thousands of barrels per day.
Nuclear weapons: Repeating a false claim he made during his presidency, Trump said, “I rebuilt our entire nuclear force.” He simply did not do so, though he did undertake efforts to modernize the US arsenal. “Long story short: then, as now, Trump’s nuclear braggadocio is utter fantasy, wholly divorced from reality,” said Stephen Schwartz, an independent expert on US nuclear weapons policy. “And not only did he not rebuild ‘our entire nuclear force,’ on his watch the total operational nuclear stockpile of warheads and bombs actually decreased by about 100 weapons!”
Global warming and sea levels: Trump delivered another version of his usual false claim about global warming, minimizing the threat by saying it will cause the ocean to rise merely “1/8th of an inch in the next 500 years.” Sea levels are currently rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.
Harris, immigrants and crime: Trump repeated his false claim that Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the presidential election, let in 13,000 murderers and 425,000 criminals over the border. The statistics he was referring to are not specifically about people who entered the country during the Biden-Harris administration; rather, they cover numerous presidential administrations, including his own, over the span of decades – “over the past 40 years or more,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a September statement to CNN. You can read more here.
Pelosi and a stock sale: Trump falsely claimed that the former speaker of the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, sold stock in Visa “the day before the lawsuit” that was filed against the company by the Justice Department in September. An official disclosure shows the stock was actually sold by Pelosi’s husband more than two and a half months before the Justice Department filed the lawsuit.
Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his false claim that President Joe Biden “gets a lot of money from China, or he got a lot of money from China, tremendous amount of money.” After years of investigation by House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any payments from China.
Chris Wallace in 2020: Trump repeated his false claim that journalist Chris Wallace, now of CNN and formerly of Fox News, tried to stop him, during a presidential debate Wallace moderated in 2020, from asking Biden about a supposed payment from the mayor of Moscow’s wife (which actually went to a company connected to Biden’s son Hunter Biden, not to the president); Trump claimed, “And Chris Wallace wouldn’t let me ask. (Biden) couldn’t answer the question. Chris Wallace stepped in and said, ‘Well, we’re not going to be talking about that.’”
Wallace never said anything like that. As the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer Trump’s question about the money, not to stop Trump from talking about the subject.
Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trump repeated his false claim that $85 billion in US military equipment was left to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal from Afghanistan under Biden and Harris. Trump’s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon has estimated that this equipment was worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.

44,Fact Check,2024,10,Fact check: Six days of Trump lies about the Hurricane Helene response,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump has delivered a barrage of lies and distortions about the federal response to Hurricane Helene.
While various misinformation about the response has spread widely without Trump’s involvement, the Republican presidential nominee has been one of the country’s leading deceivers on the subject. Over a span of six days, in public comments and social media posts, Trump has used his powerful megaphone to endorse or invent false or unsubstantiated claims.
The chief targets of his hurricane-related dishonesty have been Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the November presidential election, and President Joe Biden.
Monday: Trump falsely claims Biden hasn’t answered calls from Georgia’s governor
During a visit to Georgia on Monday, Trump said of Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp: “He’s been calling the president, hasn’t been able to get him.”
It was immediately clear that Trump’s claim was false. Kemp, a Republican, told reporters earlier Monday that he had spoken with Biden the day prior — and that it was Kemp who had initially missed a call from Biden, not the other way around.
Kemp told reporters that he had successfully called Biden right back. Kemp added: “He just said, ‘Hey, what do you need?’ And I told him, you know, ‘We got what we need. We’ll work through the federal process.’ He offered that if there’s other things we need, just to call him directly, which — I appreciate that. But we’ve had FEMA embedded with us since a day or two before the storm hit in our state operations center in Atlanta; we’ve got a great relationship with them.”
Monday: Trump cites baseless ‘reports’ about anti-Republican bias in the North Carolina response
In a social media post on Monday, Trump said of North Carolina: “I’ll be there shortly, but don’t like the reports that I’m getting about the Federal Government, and the Democrat Governor of the State, going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas.”
It’s unclear what “reports” Trump might have been getting, but there was no apparent basis for the underlying claim that the Biden administration and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper were maliciously abandoning certain communities out of partisan bias.
Trump provided no evidence when a reporter pressed him later in the day.
Thursday: Trump falsely claims the Biden-Harris response had received ‘universally’ negative reviews
Trump wrote in a social media post on Thursday that Biden and Harris “are universally being given POOR GRADES for the way that they are handling the Hurricane, especially in North Carolina.”
That wasn’t even close to accurate. Though the Biden administration’s response had certainly received criticism, it had also been praised by various state and local leaders — including the Republican governors of some of the affected states and the Democratic governor of North Carolina, plus local leaders including the Democratic mayor of the hard-hit North Carolina city of Asheville.
For example, Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said at a Tuesday press conference that federal assistance had “been superb,” noting that Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had both called and told him to let them know whatever the state needed. McMaster also said FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell had called.
Thursday: Trump falsely claims Harris spent ‘all her FEMA money’ on housing illegal migrants
At a campaign rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump claimed that “Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal migrants, many of whom should not be in our country.” He added in an election-related conspiracy theory, saying, “They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season.”
This is false.
First, there is zero basis for Trump’s suggestion that the Biden administration is running some sort of scheme to get undocumented immigrants to vote illegally in the 2024 election. Voting by noncitizens is a felony.
Second, there is zero basis for claiming that FEMA disaster assistance money was stolen — by anyone, let alone Harris personally — for the housing of migrants.
Congress appropriated $650 million in the 2024 fiscal year to fund a program that helps state and local governments house migrants — and instructed US Customs and Border Protection to transfer that $650 million to FEMA to administer the program. But this $650 million pot is entirely distinct from FEMA’s pot of disaster relief funds; as the Department of Homeland Security, the White House and independent observers noted this week, they’re just two separate things funded separately by Congress.
Congress appropriated more than $35 billion in disaster relief funds for fiscal 2024, according to official FEMA statistics.
Friday: Trump falsely claims $1 billion was ‘stolen’ from FEMA for migrants and has gone ‘missing’
Though Trump’s Thursday claim about FEMA money and migrants had already been debunked by Friday, Trump repeated the claim to reporters at least twice on Friday — and then said it again at a Friday night town hall event in North Carolina.
Saturday: Trump falsely claims the federal government is only giving $750 to people who lost their homes
At a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday, Trump strongly suggested that Americans who lost their homes in the hurricane were only being offered $750 in federal aid.
“They’re offering them $750, to people whose homes have been washed away. And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They’re offering them $750. They’ve been destroyed, these people have been destroyed,” Trump said. He added, “Think of it: We give foreign countries hundreds of billions of dollars and we’re handing North Carolina $750.”
Trump’s claim is wrong. As FEMA explained earlier in the week on social media and on a web page it created to combat misinformation about the response, $750 is merely the immediate, upfront aid survivors can get to cover basic, pressing needs like food, water, baby formula and emergency supplies. Survivors are also eligible to apply for additional forms of assistance, such as to pay for temporary housing and home repairs, that can be worth thousands of dollars; the current maximum amount for home repair assistance, for example, is $42,500.
During Harris’ visit to Georgia on Wednesday, she said, “And the federal relief and assistance that we have been providing has included FEMA providing $750 for folks who need immediate needs being met, such as food, baby formula, and the like. And you can apply now.” But she added just moments later, “FEMA is also providing tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair, to be able to cover a deductible when and if they have insurance, and also hotel costs.”
It’s also worth noting that this hurricane-related assistance to individual residents is separate from the hurricane-related assistance the federal government will provide to state governments. For example, the federal transportation department announced Saturday that it was immediately providing $100 million to North Carolina’s transportation department “to help pay for the costs of immediate emergency work resulting from Hurricane Helene flood damage.” Buttigieg added that this emergency funding “will be followed by additional federal resources.”
Saturday: Trump falsely claims there are ‘no helicopters, no rescue’ in North Carolina 
Trump, criticizing Harris for participating in a political fundraising event in California the last weekend of September, said at the Saturday rally in Pennsylvania: “Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina — no helicopters, no rescue — it’s just — what’s happened there is very bad.”
This claim about North Carolina is false. There have been numerous government and private helicopters and other aircraft involved in rescue and aid efforts in North Carolina, though some residents died before they could be rescued and a significant number of residents have remained missing or stranded for days.
The North Carolina National Guard announced Thursday that its own air assets had “completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets.”  The Washington Post reported Friday: “The drone of helicopters has become routine across western North Carolina in the wake of Helene. National Guard and civilian aircraft now crisscross the skies of a region where roads and bridges have been destroyed and people are trapped. The helicopters are delivering supplies, picking up people who need rescuing, dropping off firefighters and search-and-rescue crews and radioing for assistance for others who can be more easily accessed from the ground.“
CNN reported Saturday that air traffic over western North Carolina had increased 300% over the past seven days due to hurricane relief efforts, according to Becca Gallas, director of North Carolina’s Division of Aviation. The state said in an official update Saturday: “A total of 53 search and rescue teams from North Carolina and beyond, consisting of more than 1,600 personnel have conducted search and rescue operations during this event. Search and rescue teams have interacted with over 5,400 people, including assists, evacuations and rescues.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/06/politics/fact-check-trump-helene-response-north-carolina/index.html

CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump, seeking to capitalize politically on the devastation from Hurricane Helene, falsely claimed in a social media post on Thursday that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris “are universally being given POOR GRADES for the way that they are handling the Hurricane, especially in North Carolina.”
Facts First: Trump is wrong. The Biden administration’s response to the hurricane has received bipartisan praise from political leaders in affected states.
That praise has not been universal; there has also been some criticism and some ambivalence. But Trump’s assertion that reviews for the Biden administration’s handling of the crisis have been entirely negative is not true.
And this is just the latest Trump false claim on the subject of the administration’s hurricane response.
On Monday, Trump incorrectly said that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hadn’t been able to get Biden on the phone, though Kemp had said the same day that he had already spoken to Biden. And Trump baselessly claimed Monday that the federal government and the Democratic governor of North Carolina, Roy Cooper, were deliberately not helping residents of Republican communities in the state; Trump provided no evidence for the claim when a reporter pressed him about it.
Praise from Republican governors
Various Republican governors in the southeastern states hit by Hurricane Helene have praised the Biden administration’s response, sometimes naming Biden in particular.
Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said at a Tuesday press conference that federal assistance had “been superb,” noting that Biden and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had both called and told him to let them know whatever the state needed. McMaster added that the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, had also called. He said, “So we’re getting assistance, and we’re asking for everything we need.”
Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said at a Monday press conference, “I’m incredibly appreciative of the rapid response and the cooperation from the federal team at FEMA.” He specifically thanked Biden, among others, in a press release the day prior.
Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said at a Wednesday press conference that the response to his emergency declaration “was quick from the federal government,” adding there was “a fast turnaround, frankly,” in making the state eligible for some federal reimbursements.
At a Tuesday press conference, Lee spoke of a “rush” of officials “from the federal to the state to the local, the local emergency management agencies, local county mayors with tears in their eyes out there serving their people. There is a great deal of hope when you see what is behind the effort, the coordinated effort, in this community to begin to rebuild.”
Praise in North Carolina
Cooper, the North Carolina governor, has repeatedly praised the federal response. Sitting beside Biden during the president’s visit to North Carolina on Wednesday, Cooper said, “We’re grateful for the quick actions and close communications that we have had with the president and with the FEMA team,” adding moments later, “And Mr. President, we know that we have made a lot of asks of you, and we are grateful for your ear and for your actions.”
Cooper said in a briefing on Tuesday: “I briefed President Biden and Vice President Harris each on two occasions, and they have committed every resource available to this recovery. I appreciate the president’s quick approval of our major disaster declaration this weekend and his direction that FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell will continue to be here on the ground,” saying that residents were already starting to receive assistance funds.
The Democratic mayor of the hard-hit North Carolina city of Asheville, Esther Manheimer, said on MSNBC on Tuesday: “We are seeing incredible help, from the federal government to the state to the private sector to the nonprofit sector, faith-based organizations, everyone pouring in here with their help.” She emphasized that rebuilding from the “catastrophic” situation would take a long time regardless.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/politics/fact-check-trump-biden-hurricane-response/index.html
46,Fact Check,2024,9,Fact check: Harris makes false claim about Trump’s record on manufacturing jobs,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Vice President Kamala Harris made a false claim about the jobs record of her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, in an interview on MSNBC on Wednesday evening.
Interviewer Stephanie Ruhle asked Harris what she thought about polls that show most likely voters still think Trump is the better option on handling the economy.
Harris responded, “Well, here’s what I know in terms of the facts. Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression, when you look at, for example, the employment numbers.” After Ruhle interjected by saying it was the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic that made the employment numbers bad, Harris continued, “Even before the pandemic, he lost manufacturing jobs – by most people’s estimates, at least 200,000.”
Facts First: Harris’ claim is false. Trump presided over a gain of 414,000 US manufacturing jobs, not a loss of “at least 200,000,” before the Covid-19 pandemic hit. And the loss for his entire presidency, start to finish, was 178,000 manufacturing jobs, not 200,000 or more as Harris said.
Trump and manufacturing jobs
National job totals rise and fall for many reasons other than who the president is. Even if you’re attributing all gains and losses to the president, though, it’s just not true that Trump lost “at least 200,000” manufacturing jobs before the pandemic.
From the beginning of his presidency in January 2017 through February 2020, just before the pandemic crash, the economy added 414,000 manufacturing jobs.
Manufacturing employment, like overall employment, plummeted as much of the economy shut down in March and April 2020 – shedding 1.3 million jobs in April 2020 alone. The economy then immediately resumed adding manufacturing jobs, increasing each month from May to December 2020 before a small loss in January 2021, but those gains were not enough to make up for the losses of March and April 2020. So the overall total for Trump’s four years in office was a loss of 178,000 jobs.
When CNN asked the Harris campaign for comment Wednesday on Harris’ inaccurate claim, a campaign aide pointed to a similar but accurate remark Harris made about Trump in an economic speech in Pennsylvania earlier in the day. In the speech, she said, “Across our economy, all told, almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during his presidency – starting before the pandemic hit.”
That is true. While the steepest manufacturing job losses under Trump occurred during the pandemic, the losses did start before the pandemic; the economy experienced a net loss of 48,000 manufacturing jobs over the 13-month period from February 2019 through February 2020 after gaining under Trump before then.
But whether intentionally or because it did not spot the nuance, Harris’ own campaign turned even this correct claim into a false claim on social media. In a post of the video of Harris’ remark, the campaign’s official @KamalaHQ account paraphrased her as follows: “Vice President Harris: Almost 200,000 manufacturing jobs were lost under Trump before the pandemic.”
That’s not what she actually said – she said the job losses started before the pandemic hit, not that the “almost 200,000” losses all occurred before the pandemic – and, again, that’s not true.
Harris’ claim about the economy Trump ‘left us’
We won’t offer a firm fact check verdict on Harris’ vaguer claim that “Donald Trump left us with the worst economy since the Great Depression, when you look at, for example, the employment numbers.”
The Harris campaign aide said Harris was referring to Trump’s overall jobs record; he was the first president to preside over a net four-year loss of jobs since Herbert Hoover, who left office during Depression-era 1933.
But it’s worth noting that the unemployment rate was not at its worst level since the Great Depression in the month the Biden-Harris administration took over from Trump. While the rate had skyrocketed to 14.8% in April 2020, the highest since 1939, it had already declined to 6.4% in January 2021, the month of Biden’s inauguration. That rate was exceeded as recently as 2014.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/25/politics/fact-check-harris-trumps-manufacturing-jobs/index.html
47,Fact Check,2024,9,Fact check: Trump won’t stop telling a lie that there were no terror attacks during his presidency,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
During his presidency, Donald Trump talked repeatedly about the terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States on his watch.
He sometimes denounced these attacks in vivid detail. In his 2018 State of the Union address, he spoke of “two terrorist attacks in New York” in “recent weeks.” He visited Pittsburgh and El Paso after terror attacks there. He invited survivors of a California attack to the White House.
Now, though, he keeps saying he presided over no terror attacks at all.
Throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has lied that there were zero terror attacks during his presidency. He delivered a slightly vaguer version of the claim in his campaign announcement speech in 2022, made the claim explicit by 2023, repeated it at the CNN presidential debate in June, and said it again at a campaign rally on Monday.
“We didn’t have one terror attack during my administration,” he said at the rally in Pennsylvania.
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. There were numerous terror attacks during his presidency, including high-profile jihadist attacks in his hometown of New York City. Terror attacks under Trump killed dozens of people.
An Islamic extremist murdered eight people in an October 2017 terrorist attack in New York City, which the extremist carried out in support of the terror group ISIS. Trump spoke repeatedly as president about the horrors of this attack, calling the perpetrator an “animal” and lamenting how surviving victims suffered severe injuries.
In December 2017, another ISIS supporter set off a bomb in the New York City subway system, injuring people nearby. Trump issued a written statement denouncing this attack, noting it was “the second terror attack in New York in the last two months.”
Trump’s Justice Department found that a 2019 attack by an extremist member of Saudi Arabia’s military, which killed three US servicemembers and injured others at a military base in Florida, “was motivated by jihadist ideology” and was carried out by a longtime “associate” of al Qaeda. Trump commented on this attack the day it happened.
Other terror attacks under Trump
There were a variety of other terrorist attacks during Trump’s presidency. Here are just some of them.
In 2018, a White nationalist carried out the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US, murdering 11 people and wounding six others in a shooting attack at a synagogue in Pittsburgh; Trump visited the synagogue in the aftermath. A 2019 terror attack on a California synagogue by another White nationalist left one dead and three injured; Trump publicly addressed this attack and then honored survivors at the White House.
A White nationalist pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in furtherance of an act of terrorism, along with other charges, for killing a Black man in New York City in 2017 to try to start a race war. The perpetrator himself called the murder a “terrorist attack.”
Also in 2017, an anti-Republican extremist attacked Republican lawmakers and others who were practicing in Virginia for the annual charity congressional baseball game, shooting then-House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three others. The chief state prosecutor for the area described the attack as “an act of terrorism.”
Trump’s Justice Department described a White nationalist’s 2019 shooting massacre at a Walmart in Texas, which killed 23 people and injured 22 more, as “an act of domestic terrorism.” The killer was targeting Latinos.
And Trump’s Justice Department said it was a “domestic terrorist attack” when one of Trump’s supporters mailed improvised explosive devices to CNN, prominent Democratic officials and others in 2018.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/24/politics/fact-check-trump-terror-attacks-presidency/index.html

 — 
Former President Donald Trump delivered more than 30 false claims during Tuesday’s presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, CNN’s preliminary count found – as he did during his June debate against President Joe Biden.
Trump again delivered a staggering quantity and variety of false claims, some of which were egregious lies about topics including abortion, immigration and the economy.
Harris was far more accurate than Trump; CNN’s preliminary count found just one false claim from the vice president, though she also added some claims that were misleading or lacking in key context.
Here is a fact check of some of the remarks made by each candidate.
Harris on Trump’s tariff plan
Former Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that former President Donald Trump’s policies would result in a “Trump sales tax” that would raise prices for middle class families by about $4,000 a year.
Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House.
Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.
Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund a liberal think tank.
If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP.
Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households.

Trump on inflation during his presidency
Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday’s debate with Vice President Kamala Harris that there was virtually no inflation during his administration.
“I had no inflation, virtually no inflation,” Trump said.
Facts First: This is false. Cumulative inflation over the course of Trump’s presidency was about 7.8%.
Inflation was low at the end of Trump’s term, having plummeted during the Covid-19 pandemic. The year-over-year inflation rate was about 1.4% in January 2021, the month Trump left office.

Trump claims migrants are arriving to US from prisons and mental institutions
Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday repeated a claim that migrants are arriving to the US after fleeing prisons and mental institutions.
“We have millions of people pouring into our country from prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums,” Trump claimed.
Trump makes this claim often, and he’s often alleged that jails and mental institutions are being emptied out deliberately to somehow dump people upon the US.
Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim.
Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN last year they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.
Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
In response to CNN’s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated.
And a second article that Cheung cited at the time, about Mexico’s president having freed 2,685 prisoners, was not about migration at all; that article simply explained that the president had freed them “as part of an effort to free those who have not committed serious crimes or were being held unjustly.”

Trump on the number of undocumented immigrants under Biden
Former President Donald Trump claimed during Tuesday night’s debate that “21 million people” are crossing the border monthly into the United States under President Joe Biden.
Facts First: This number is false. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern borders from February 2021 through July 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was roughly 10 million, far less than Trump’s “21 million” figure. 
An “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. Even if you added the estimated number of “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans have said is more than 1.7 million during the Biden-Harris administration, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” said Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in an email in June, when Trump made similar claims.

Harris on the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling
Vice President Kamala Harris said during Tuesday night’s debate that the US Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that Trump would “essentially be immune from any misconduct” undertaken by him while in the White House.
“Let’s talk about extreme and understand the context in which this election in 2024 is taking place. The United States Supreme Court recently ruled that the former president would essentially be immune from any misconduct if he were to enter the White House again,” she said.
Facts First: This needs context. In their decision in July in the historic case, the six conservative justices granted Trump some presidential immunity from criminal prosecution, but not blanket immunity, as the former president had sought in his federal election subversion case. The court said Trump could not be criminally pursued over “official acts,” but that he could face prosecution over alleged criminal actions involving “unofficial acts” taken while in office. 
“The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative majority.

Trump repeats false claim about migrants eating people’s pets
Former President Donald Trump repeated a false claim at Tuesday’s debate that has been promoted by numerous prominent Republicans in the past week, including Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance. Trump claimed that Haitian migrants in the city of Springfield, Ohio, are stealing people’s pet dogs and cats and eating them.
“In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats,” Trump said. “They’re eating the pets of the people that live there.”
Facts First: This is false. The City of Springfield and the local police have said they have seen no evidence for the claim – which appeared to originate from a Facebook post in which someone purporting to be a local resident passed along what they said was a story about their neighbor’s daughter’s friend.
In a statement to CNN on Monday, a spokesperson for the City of Springfield said “there have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.”
The Springfield News-Sun reported that “the Springfield Police Division said Monday morning they have received no reports related to pets being stolen and eaten.”
Vance acknowledged on social media on Tuesday that it is “possible” that the “rumors” he has heard from local residents “will turn out to be false,” though he also encouraged people to “keep the cat memes flowing.”

Trump on who pays for tariffs
Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday the United States took in billions of dollars from China as a result of his tariffs.
Facts First: Trump’s claim about how tariffs work is false. A US tariff is paid by importing businesses in the United States – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border.
Here’s how tariffs work: When the United States puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American importer.
Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
It’s true that the US Treasury has collected more than $242 billion from the tariffs Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods – but those duties were paid by US importers, not the country of China.

Harris on her stance on fracking
During Tuesday night’s debate, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “I made it that very clear in 2020 – I will not ban fracking,” though she had said, while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” 
 
Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate.
Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.”
It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Tuesday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior.

Trump falsely claims US experienced highest inflation ever under Biden
Former President Donald Trump said the US experienced “the highest inflation” ever under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
Facts First: Trump’s claim that inflation was at its highest under the Biden-Harris administration is false. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, hit 9.1% in June 2022. That wasn’t the highest ever recorded. Rather, it was the highest inflation rate in nearly forty years. For instance, in 1980, inflation hit nearly 15%, according to CPI data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Some of the earliest inflation data the BLS maintains indicates that inflation was even higher in 1917, when it was trending at nearly 18%.

Former President Donald Trump claimed that when Vice President Kamala Harris previously ran for the presidency, during the 2020 election cycle, she was the very first candidate to drop out of a crowded Democratic primary.
“When she ran, she was the first one to leave because she failed,” Trump claimed, referring to Harris’ 2020 bid, while arguing that Harris didn’t receive any votes this primary cycle because President Joe Biden was still at top of the ticket during the primaries.
Facts First: This is false. Harris was far from the first candidate to drop out of that Democratic primary when she exited the race in early December 2019
Harris was preceded by the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate, plus some others.

Trump on Harris’ border role
Former President Donald Trump claimed at Tuesday’s debate that Vice President Kamala Harris has been the Biden administration’s “border czar.”
“Remember that she was a border czar,” Trump said. “She doesn’t want to be called the border czar because she’s embarrassed by the border.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim about Harris’ border role is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.
Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.
A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.”
Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries. (Biden also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.”
Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far.

Trump claims legal scholars wanted states, not the federal government, to decide how to regulate abortion
Former President Donald Trump repeated a version of one of his frequent claims Tuesday night that legal scholars wanted Roe v. Wade overturned so individual states could instead decide how to regulate abortion.
“Every legal scholar, every Democrat, every Republican, liberal, conservative, all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote, and that’s what happened,” Trump said. “It’s the vote of the people, now it’s not tied up in the federal government.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Many legal scholars wanted the right to have an abortion preserved in federal law, as several told CNN when Trump made a similar claim in April. 
Some legal scholars who support abortion rights had wanted Roe written in a different way, including even the late liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but that isn’t the same as saying that “every legal scholar” believed Roe should be overturned and sent to the states.
“Any claim that all legal scholars wanted Roe overturned is mind-numbingly false,” Rutgers Law School professor Kimberly Mutcherson, a legal scholar who supported the preservation of Roe, said in April.
“Donald Trump’s claim is flatly incorrect,” another legal scholar who did not want Roe overturned, Maya Manian, an American University law professor and faculty director of the university’s Health Law and Policy Program, said in April.
Trump’s claim is “obviously not” true, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, who is an expert on the history of the US abortion debate. Ziegler, who also did not want Roe overturned, said in an April interview: “Most legal scholars probably track most Americans, who didn’t want to overturn Roe … It wasn’t as if legal scholars were somehow outliers.”

Trump blames Rep. Nancy Pelosi for poor security at the Capitol on Jan. 6
Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker of the House, was responsible for inadequate security at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.
“Nancy Pelosi was responsible. She didn’t do her job,” he said.
Facts First: This claim is false. The speaker of the House is not in charge of Capitol security. Capitol security is overseen by the Capitol Police Board, a body that includes the sergeants at arms of the House and the Senate. Pelosi’s office has explicitly said she was not presented with an offer of 10,000 National Guardsmen as Trump has claimed, telling CNN last year that claims to the contrary are “lies.” And even if Pelosi had been told of an offer of National Guard troops, she would not have had the power to turn it down. The speaker of the House has no authority to prevent the deployment of the District of Columbia National Guard, which reports to the president (whose authority was delegated, under a decades-old executive order, to the Secretary of the Army).

Trump claims Harris met with Putin days before Russian invasion
Former President Donald Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris met with Russian President Vladimir Putin days before Russia invaded Ukraine and failed to deter him from the invasion.
“They sent her to negotiate peace before this war started,” Trump said, referring to Harris. “Three days later, he went in, and he started the war because everything they said was weak and stupid.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris was not sent to negotiate peace, and she has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference.
“Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said in July, according to a state-owned Russian news agency.
The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.”
CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.”
The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.

Trump repeats familiar claim about military equipment left in Afghanistan during withdrawal
In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump repeated a familiar claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when President Joe Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.
“We wouldn’t have left $85 billion worth of brand new, beautiful military equipment behind,” Trump said.
Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.
As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure – it’s closer to $83 billion – for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A fraction of this funding was for equipment.

Harris claims Trump left with worst unemployment since Great Depression
Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday claimed that former President Donald Trump left office “with the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression.”
Facts First: Harris’ claim is false.
In January 2021, when Trump left office, the official unemployment rate was 6.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The unemployment rate skyrocketed to 14.8% in April 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic shut down global economies, including that of the US. That was the highest rate since 1939, according to BLS historical records.
Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. But by the time Trump left office, the unemployment rate had gone down.

Trump’s claim about jobs created under Biden administration
Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that 818,000 of the jobs created under the Biden-Harris administration from April 2023 to March 2024 were a “fraud.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false and needs additional context.
Trump was referring to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ recently released preliminary estimate for its annual benchmark revision that suggested there were 818,000 fewer jobs for the year ended in March 2024 than were initially reported.
Economic data is often revised, especially as more comprehensive information becomes available, to provide a clearer, more accurate picture of the dynamics at play.
Every year – including the four years when Trump was president – the Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts a thorough review of the survey-based employment estimates from the monthly jobs report and reconciles those estimates with fuller employment counts measured by the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages program.
This annual process, called a benchmarking, provides a near-complete employment count, because the BLS can correct for sampling and modeling errors from the surveys and re-anchor those estimates to unemployment insurance tax records. The revision process is two-fold: A preliminary estimate is released in mid-August, and the final revision is issued in February, alongside the January jobs report.
While the recently announced preliminary revision (which amounts to 0.5% of total employment) was the largest downward revision since 2009 (which was -902,000, or -0.7%), there have been other large revisions made in recent years – notably a downward revision of 514,000 jobs (-0.3%) for the year ended in March 2019, during the Trump administration.
The preliminary revision was larger than typical, but economists and even a Trump-appointed BLS commissioner have publicly stated that there is nothing nefarious at play. Revisions of this size typically happen at turning points in the economy, when the BLS’ methodology is less reliable, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.
Additionally, the pandemic had a seismic effect on the economy as well as the gold standard methods used to measure it, so this large revision is likely a reflection of that. Specifically, the BLS’ model for capturing business “births and deaths” is likely overstating new firm formation while underestimating deaths, Oxford Economics’ Chief US Economist Ryan Sweet told CNN.

Trump claims Biden took money from China, Ukraine
Former President Donald Trump claimed that President Joe Biden has taken money from China and Ukraine, including $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow.
Facts First: There is no public evidence that Joe Biden received money from any foreign entities while in office or as a private citizen. While investigations by House Republicans have found that Biden family members who have been involved in business, including his son Hunter Biden and brother James Biden (“and their related companies”), have received over $18 million from foreign entities, they have found no proof to date that the president himself received any foreign money.
Roughly a year after launching their impeachment inquiry into Biden and more than three years into Biden’s presidency, the closest House Republicans have gotten to connecting the president to money earned by his family members is in finding that the president received personal checks from his brother while he was a private citizen after his vice presidency. Republicans have questioned the legitimacy of these transactions and used them to suggest that Joe Biden did benefit from his brother’s relationships with foreign entities. But banking records provide substantial evidence that Joe Biden had made loans to his brother and then was paid back without interest, as House Democrats have said.
Biden said at a presidential debate against Trump in 2020: “I have not taken a penny from any foreign source ever in my life.”
The Washington Post dove into the allegations in 2022 that Hunter Biden received money from the wife of the Moscow mayor. But there’s no evidence that Joe Biden had any involvement regardless.

Trump falsely claims Biden orchestrated criminal cases against him
Former President Donald Trump repeated a claim he has made on numerous occasions during his campaign – that the Biden administration orchestrated a criminal election subversion case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, a criminal fraud case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Manhattan, and a civil fraud case that was brought against him by the attorney general of New York state.
Facts First: This is false. There is no evidence that Biden or his administration were behind any of these cases. None of these officials reports to the president or even to the federal government. 
Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in early June about the Manhattan case in which Trump was found guilty: “The Manhattan district attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.”
As he did in his conversation with Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney’s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo’s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021.

Harris overstates the effect of the $50,000 start-up deduction she proposed
Vice President Kamala Harris implied Tuesday that all prospective start-up business owners will be able to take advantage of the $50,000 tax deduction she’s proposing for new small businesses, saying that it will help them “pursue their ambitions.”
“I have a plan to give startup businesses $50,000 tax deduction to pursue their ambitions, their innovation, their ideas, their hard work,” Harris said.
Facts First: Harris’ point about new business owners being able to benefit from the deduction she’s proposed lacks context.
“Businesses that fail before they begin to turn a profit won’t be able to utilize the deduction, because to take a deduction you have to have taxable income to deduct against,” Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN.
In other words, the tax deduction may not ultimately help businesses owners get off the ground and running initially. However, it may help lower their tax burden over time, but only if they turn a profit.

Trump claims Biden job growth was all ‘bounce-back jobs’
Former President Donald Trump said of the Biden-Harris administration, “the only jobs they got were bounce-back jobs” that “bounced back and it went to their benefit,” but “I was the one that created them.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims that the job growth during the Biden-Harris administration presidency has been all “bounce-back” gains where people went back to their old jobs is not fully correct.
More than 21 million jobs were lost under Trump in March and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. Following substantial relief and recovery measures, the US started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million jobs from May 2020 through December 2020, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
The recovery continued after Biden took office, with the US reaching and surpassing its pre-pandemic (February 2020) employment totals in June 2022.
The job gains didn’t stop there. Since June 2022 and through August 2024, the US has added nearly 6.4 million more jobs in what’s become the fifth-longest period of employment expansion on record. In total under the Biden-Harris administration, around 16 million jobs have been added.
But it’s not entirely fair nor accurate to say the jobs gained were all “bounce-back” or were people simply returning to their former positions.
The pandemic drastically reshaped the employment landscape. For one, a significant portion of the labor force did not return due to early retirements, deaths, long Covid or caregiving responsibilities.
Additionally, because of shifts in consumer spending patterns as well as health-and-safety implications, public-facing industries could not fully reopen or restaff immediately. Some of those workers found jobs in other industries or used the opportunity to start their own businesses.

Trump falsely says he rebuilt the US military
Former President Donald Trump repeated Tuesday past claims that he “rebuilt our entire military.”
“We’re going to end up in a third world war, and it will be a war like no other. Because of nuclear weapons, the power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan,” he said.
Facts First: Trump’s claim to have rebuilt the entire military is false. “This claim is not even close to being true. The military has tens of thousands of pieces of equipment, and the vast majority of it predates the Trump administration,” Todd Harrison, an expert on the defense budget and a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, told CNN in November.
Harrison said in a November email: “Moreover, the process of acquiring new equipment for the military is slow and takes many years. It’s not remotely possible to replace even half of the military’s inventory of equipment in one presidential term. I just ran the numbers for military aircraft, and about 88% of the aircraft in the U.S. military inventory today (including Air Force, Army, Navy, and Marine Corps aircraft) were built before Trump took office. In terms of fighters in particular, we still have F-16s and F- 15s in the Air Force that are over 40 years old.”

Trump on US and European aid to Ukraine
Former President Donald Trump complained that the US had given $250 billion to $275 billion in aid to Ukraine while European countries had given just $100 billion to $150 billion even though they are located closer to Ukraine.
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. In total, European countries have contributed significantly more aid to Ukraine than the US has during and just before the Russian invasion began in early 2022, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy in Germany. 
The Kiel Institute, which closely tracks aid to Ukraine, found that, from late January 2022 (just before Russia’s invasion in February 2022) through June 2024, the European Union and individual European countries had committed a total of about $207 billion to Ukraine, in military, financial and humanitarian assistance, compared to about $109 billion (€98.4 billion) committed by the US. Europe also exceeded the US in aid that had actually been “allocated” to Ukraine – defined by the institute as aid either delivered or specified for delivery – at about $122 billion (€110.21 billion) for Europe compared to about $83 billion (€75.1 billion) for the US.
In addition, Europe had committed more total military aid to Ukraine, at about $88 billion (79.57 billion euro) to about $72 billion (64.87 billion euro) for the US. The US narrowly led on military aid that had actually been allocated, at about $56.91 billion for the US (51.58 billion euro) to about $56.84 billion for Europe (51.52 billion euro), but that was nowhere near the lopsided margin Trump suggested.
It’s important to note that it’s possible to come up with different totals using different methodology. And the Kiel Institute found that Ukraine itself was getting only about half of the money in a 2024 US bill that had widely been described as a $61 billion aid bill for Ukraine; the institute said the rest of the funds were mostly going to the Defense Department.

Trump on crime statistics
Former President Donald Trump claimed during the debate on Tuesday that “crime in this country is through the roof.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim that crime rates are up is false. And while it is true that the FBI’s most recent data did not include some large cities, crime counts still show a downward trend as both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024.
There are limitations to the FBI-published data from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data and the submitted data usually has some errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime.
The preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% decline in murder and a roughly 6% decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in Trump’s last calendar year in office in 2020. The preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime.
Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said in an email to CNN last week: There is ample evidence that crime is falling in 2024 and murder specifically fell at the fastest – or one of the fastest – paces ever recorded in 2023 and again in 2024.”
Asher continued: “The evidence comes from a variety of sources including the FBI’s quarterly data, the CDC, the Gun Violence Archive, and our newly launched Real-Time Crime Index. We show a 5 percent decline in violent crime – including a 16 percent decline in murder – and a 9 percent decline in property crime through June 2024 in over 300 cities with available data so far this year. Data from these various sources suggest the US murder rate was down significantly in 2023 relative to 2020/2021 highs but still slightly above 2019’s level.”
After Trump claimed in June that “crime is so much up,” Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted to CNN that the claim is contradicted both by the data from the FBI and from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces. She said: “It would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down.”

Trump falsely claims Central Park Five pleaded guilty
Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the Central Park Five pleaded guilty to crimes, and that the five teenagers “badly hurt a person, killed a person” in the 1989 attack.
Facts First: These claims are false. The Central Park Five did not plead guilty, they were convicted by a jury at trial (that conviction has since been vacated). Also, the five teenagers were accused of raping a jogger – not of murder. 
Five teenagers who were accused of raping a jogger in 1989 were pressured into giving false confessions. They were exonerated in 2002 when DNA evidence linked another person to the crime. The teenagers sued the city, and the case was settled in 2014.
A sixth teenager charged in the attack did plead guilty to robbery charges. His conviction was also overturned because there was no physical evidence connecting him to either the rape or the robbery, and because people who blamed the sixth teen later recanted.

Trump on ending the Nord Stream pipeline
Former President Donald Trump claimed on Tuesday that he “ended” the Nord Stream pipeline.
“I ended the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and Biden put it back on day one,” Trump said. “But he ended the XL pipeline – the XL pipeline in our country, he ended that. But he let the Russians build a pipeline going all over Europe and heading into Germany; the biggest pipeline in the world.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. He did not “end” Nord Stream.
While he did sign a bill that included sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around 90% complete – and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump’s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters.
The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine in early 2022. The pipeline was damaged later that year in what has been described as a likely act of sabotage.

Trump falsely claims some states allow abortion after birth
Former President Donald Trump claimed that some states allow people to execute babies, in addition to allowing abortion in the ninth month, and he singled out the governors including Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz for his stance on the issue.
On Walz, Trump said, “He also says execution after birth – it’s execution, no longer abortion because the baby is born – is OK. And that’s not OK with me.”
“They have abortion in the ninth month. They even have – and you can look at the governor of West Virginia, the previous governor of West Virginia not the current governor he’s doing an excellent job. But the governor before, he said, ‘The baby will be born, and we will decide what to do with the baby,’ in other words, ‘We’ll execute the baby,’” Trump said.
Facts First: Trump’s claim about infanticide is false. No state allows for the execution of a baby after it is born.
That’s called infanticide, which is illegal in every state.
“Every state explicitly criminalizes infanticide,” Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said in June.
“There is no basis for this claim,” Kimberly Mutcherson, a professor at Rutgers Law School, also said at the time.
There are some cases in which parents choose palliative care, a kind of care that can provide relief for the symptoms and stress of a deadly illness or condition that gives the baby just minutes, hours or days to live. That is not the same as executing a baby.
Trump also misspoke. It was not the governor of West Virginia, it was the former Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam who made a controversial remark in 2019 that many Republicans said sounded like he supported infanticide. Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, said his words were being misinterpreted. In any case, infanticide was not legal when Northam was governor of Virginia nor was it ever legal in West Virginia either.
As for abortions in the ninth month, Minnesota is one of a handful of states that allow abortion at any stage of a pregnancy, but it doesn’t mean that doctors perform them. Nationally, just 0.9% of abortions in 2021 – the latest year the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has data – happened at 21 weeks or later. Many abortions at this point in the pregnancy are necessary due to serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies. More than 93 percent of abortions were conducted before the 14th week of pregnancy, according to the CDC. In Minnesota, according to state data for 2022, of the 12,175 abortions in the state, only two happened between the 25 and 30th week of pregnancy. None happened after the 30th week of pregnancy that year.

Trump on NATO funding
Former President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” for years, until he “got them to pay up” by threatening not to follow through on the alliance’s collective defense clause.
“For years, we were paying almost all of NATO,” he said. “We were being ripped off by European nations, both on trade and on NATO. I got them to pay up by saying one of the statements you made before, ‘if you don’t pay, we’re not going to protect you.’ Otherwise we would have never gotten it.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim that the US was “paying almost all of NATO” needs context. Official NATO figures show that in 2016, the last year before Trump took office, US defense spending made up about 71% of total defense spending by NATO members – a large majority, but not “almost all.” And Trump’s claim is even more inaccurate if he was talking about the direct contributions to NATO that cover NATO’s organizational expenses and are set based on each country’s national income; the US was responsible for about 22% of those contributions in 2016.
The US share of total NATO military spending fell to about 65% in 2023. And the US is now responsible for about 16% of direct contributions to NATO, the same as Germany. Erwan Lagadec, an expert on NATO as a research professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School of International Affairs and director of its Transatlantic Program, said the US share was reduced from 22% “to placate Trump” and is a “sweetheart deal” given that the US makes up more than half of the alliance’s total GDP.

Trump claims Harris wants to get rid of private health insurance
In Tuesday night’s debate, former President Donald Trump once again claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris wants to get rid of private health insurance.
“But she won’t improve private insurance for people, private medical insurance,” Trump said. “That’s another thing she doesn’t want to give. People are paying privately for insurance that have worked hard and made money and they wanna have private – she wants everybody to be on government insurance where you wait six months for an operation that you need immediately.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is outdated. While Harris did say in her first presidential campaign in 2019 that she wanted to eliminate private health insurance, the plan she rolled out later that year included a role for private insurers, and as vice president, she has supported bolstering the Affordable Care Act. Coverage on the Obamacare exchanges are offered by private insurers.
At a CNN town hall in January 2019, Harris, who was then a California senator vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, said that she would eliminate private health insurance as a necessary part of implementing Medicare for All, a government-run health insurance proposal promoted by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Harris was a co-sponsor of Sanders’ bill, which called for essentially getting rid of the private insurance market.
A furor erupted, and her national press secretary and an adviser quickly walked back her comment, saying she was open to multiple paths to Medicare for All. And private insurers were included in the plan she rolled out in July 2019.
“We will allow private insurers to offer Medicare plans as a part of this system that adhere to strict Medicare requirements on costs and benefits,” Harris wrote in a Medium post about her plan. “Medicare will set the rules of the road for these plans, including price and quality, and private insurance companies will play by those rules, not the other way around.”
Since she was named President Joe Biden’s vice president, she has supported his efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, which has led to a record number of people signing up for 2024 coverage from private insurers on the individual market.
Harris’ campaign has confirmed that the vice president no longer supports a single-payer health care system.

Harris on manufacturing jobs
Vice President Kamala Harris claimed Tuesday that the economy has added over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs during the Biden-Harris administration.
Facts First: Harris was rounding up and was referring to labor market data available through July 2024, which showed the US economy added 765,000 manufacturing jobs from the first full month of the Biden-Harris administration, February 2021. Though it’s worth noting that the growth almost entirely occurred in 2021 and 2022 (with 746,000 manufacturing jobs added starting in February 2021) before a relatively flat 2023 and through the first seven months of 2024.
In August, the US economy lost an estimated 24,000 manufacturing jobs, bringing that tally down to 739,000, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics’ preliminary employment data released Friday.
The gain during the Biden-Harris era is, however, over 800,000 using non-seasonally-adjusted figures that are also published by the federal government – in fact, the non-seasonally adjusted gain is 874,000 through August – so there is at least a defensible basis for Harris’ claim. However, seasonally adjusted data smooths out volatility and is traditionally used to observe trends.
An estimated 172,000 manufacturing jobs were lost during former President Donald Trump’s administration, however, most of those losses occurred following the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in early 2020. From February 2017, the first full month that Trump was in office, through February 2020, the US economy added 414,000 manufacturing jobs, BLS data shows.
Presidential terms don’t start and end in a vacuum, and economic cycles can carry over regardless of party. Additionally, the ups and downs of the labor market and the broader economy are influenced by factors beyond a single president, although specific economic policies can influence economic and job growth.

Trump claims he saved Obamacare
Former President Donald Trump claimed in Tuesday night’s debate that he saved Obamacare, his predecessor’s landmark health reform law that Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace.
“I had a choice to make: Do I save it and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it,” Trump said.
Facts First: Trump’s claim is misleading. The only reason Obamacare wasn’t repealed was because congressional Republicans could not amass enough votes to kill the law in 2017. During Trump’s administration, he and his officials took many steps to weaken the Affordable Care Act, though they did continue to operate the Obamacare exchanges.
Within hours of taking the oath of office, Trump signed an executive order aimed at rolling back Obamacare – stating that the administration’s official policy was “to seek the prompt repeal” of the Affordable Care Act.
Although Congress failed to repeal it, Trump did manage to undermine the law, which led to a decline in enrollment. He cut the open enrollment period in half, to only six weeks. He also slashed funding for advertising and for navigators, who are critical to helping people sign up. At the same time, he increased the visibility of insurance agents who can also sell non-Obamacare plans.
Trump signed an executive order in October 2017 making it easier for Americans to access alternative policies that have lower premiums than Affordable Care Act plans – but in exchange for fewer protections and benefits. And he ended subsidy payments to health insurers to reduce eligible enrollees’ out-of-pocket costs.
Plus, his administration refused to defend several central provisions of the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by a coalition of Republican-led states, arguing that key parts of Obamacare should be invalidated. The Supreme Court ultimately dismissed the challenge and left the law in place.
Enrollment declined until the final year of his term, which was in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Harris on US military members on active duty in combat zones
Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday, “As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.”
Facts First: This claim is misleading. While US service members are not engaged in major wars like those in Iraq and Afghanistan, US service members have come under fire in the Middle East repeatedly over the last year and increasingly been in harm’s way since Hamas’ attacks on Israel last October.
There are currently roughly 2,500 US troops in Iraq, who have come under repeated fire since Hamas’ attacks on Israel on October 7. Also since October, more US troops have deployed to the Middle East, including on Navy ships to the Gulf of Oman and Red Sea. CNN cited two US officials in reporting Tuesday that the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was last operating near the Gulf of Oman, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier strike group is expected to leave the region this week after last operating in the same area.
Additionally, in the last several months, US service members have taken fire in the Middle East and been injured or killed. Last month, eight US service members were treated for traumatic brain injuries and smoke inhalation after a drone struck Rumalyn Landing Zone in Syria. In January, three US soldiers were killed, and dozens more were injured, in an attack on a small outpost in Jordan called Tower 22. The same month, two US Navy SEALs died after going missing one night at sea while trying to seize lethal aid being transported from Iran to Yemen.

49,Fact Check,2024,9,Fact check: Trump and Vance keep falsely describing how tariffs work,Katie Lobosco,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump and Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance continue to falsely describe how one of their major policy proposals, across-the-board tariffs, would work.
Trump has falsely, and repeatedly, claimed that China – not US importers – pay the tariff.
At a rally in Arizona in mid-August, he claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, is lying when she refers to his tariff plan as a “Trump tax.”
“She is a liar. She makes up crap … I am going to put tariffs on other countries coming into our country, and that has nothing to do with taxes to us. That is a tax on another country,” Trump said.
In September, he repeated the claim during an interview with Fox News: “It’s not a tax on the middle class. It’s a tax on another country.”
And he said again during a rally in Wisconsin Saturday that “it’s not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country.”
Vance said in late August that as a result of tariffs Trump imposed during his presidency, “prices went down for American citizens.”
“They went up for the Chinese but they went down for our people,” Vance added.
But that’s not true.
Facts First: Trump and Vance’s claims about how tariffs work are false. A tariff is a tax that is paid by US businesses – not other countries – when a foreign-made good arrives at the American border. One of the intended goals of a tariff is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, and study after study show that the duties do drive up costs for Americans.
Tariffs are a tax
Here’s how tariffs work: When the US puts a tariff on an imported good, the cost of the tariff usually comes directly out of the bank account of an American buyer.
“It’s fair to call a tariff a tax because that’s exactly what it is,” said Erica York, a senior economist at the right-leaning Tax Foundation.
“There’s no way around it. It is a tax on people who buy things from foreign businesses,” she added.
Trump has said that if elected, he would impose tariffs of up to 20% on every foreign import coming into the US, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He also said he would impose a “100% tariff” on countries that shift away from using the US dollar.
These duties would add to the tariffs he put on foreign steel and aluminum, washing machines, and many Chinese-made goods including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. President Joe Biden has left many of the Trump-era tariffs in place.
It’s possible that a foreign company chooses to pay the tariff or to lower its prices to stay competitive with US-made goods that aren’t impacted by the duty.
But study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, have found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
To date, Americans have paid more than $242 billion to the US Treasury for tariffs that Trump imposed on imported solar panels, steel and aluminum, and Chinese-made goods, according to US Customs and Border Protection.
Tariffs costs are passed from the US importer to the US consumer
Once an American importing company pays the tariff to the US Treasury, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it along to the buyer of its goods – whether that’s a retailer or a consumer.
For example, American shoe seller Deer Stags, which imports most of its product line from China, decided to do a little bit of both.
It was harder to get customers to pay more for existing styles that Deer Stags had carried for a long time, president Rick Muskat told CNN. So the company ended up eating the cost of the tariffs placed on some older styles and charging more for some new items.
There are many factors that can affect a retailer’s decision to raise prices on some items and not others.
Some goods affected by Trump’s tariffs saw “sharp price increases,” but overall, the tariffs’ impact on retail prices “is more mixed,” one study published in 2019 found.
“Somebody in the United States has to pay this tax,” said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.
“If it’s not consumers, it’s going to be companies. And if it’s companies that pay it, ultimately, the cost is going to be borne, by some degree, by workers,” he said.
Tariffs are meant to raise prices – and do
Even though the full cost of the tariff may not be passed from the retailer to the consumer, there’s widespread consensus among economists that some prices do rise for consumers due to tariffs.
For example, the median price of washing machines in the US rose by about $86 – or nearly 12% – after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made ones, according to a study published in 2019. The researchers also found that the price of dryers – which were not impacted by tariffs – but are usually sold in a package with washing machines – also increased by 12%, or about $92 per unit.
Together, the price increases cost consumers more than $1.5 billion during the first year the tariffs were in place. The duties expired in 2023.
A US International Trade Commission study published last year confirmed that prices went up for consumers on both imported and domestically made washing machines.
One of the goals of using tariffs is to raise prices on foreign-made goods, making it easier for domestic producers to sell goods at a competitive price.
A report Trump was required to send to Congress in 2018 about the washing machine tariffs said that the duties would “provide an impetus for importers to increase their prices.” In fact, the tariffs were put in place in response to Whirlpool’s complaint that washing machines made in South Korea and Mexico were being sold in the US for less than they cost to produce.
When asked for proof that Trump’s proposed tariffs would not raise prices, his campaign pointed CNN to a study from Jeff Ferry, an economist at the Coalition for a Prosperous America – a group that advocates for US producers and manufacturers.
But Ferry’s study actually found that prices would rise by 3.26% over a six-year period following the implementation of the across-the-board tariffs, as a one-time price increase.
His analysis looked at the impact the tariffs would have when combined with tax cuts paid for with the tariff revenue. In that scenario, Americans would see lower taxes and higher incomes despite the increase in prices, according to his study.
Ferry told CNN that the traditional economic model used by most economists to analyze the price of tariffs downplays the positives that can happen – like an increase in domestic production and the creation of jobs – and that he adjusted his model accordingly.
It’s true that after Trump imposed tariffs on foreign-made steel, some American steel companies reopened mills and created new jobs. But several studies – like one from the Tax Foundation and another from the US-China Business Council – say that overall, the US economy lost jobs due to Trump’s tariffs and the retaliatory tariffs other countries put on US goods and agricultural products.

50,Fact Check,2024,9,Analysis: Trump is still telling lies he told eight years ago,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
In a speech last week to the National Guard Association of the United States, former President Donald Trump claimed that he was the president who “created” the Veterans Choice health care program, and got it “passed in Congress,” after others had wanted to do so “for 57 years.”
In reality, President Barack Obama was the president who signed the program into law in 2014. The law Trump signed in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, expanded the Veterans Choice program but didn’t create it.
I could fact-check this Trump lie half-asleep – because he’s been telling it for more than six years.
Trump’s lying is most exceptional in its relentlessness, a never-ending avalanche of wrongness that can bury even the most devoted fact-checkers. But it’s also notable for its repetitiveness. He has found his hits, and he’ll keep playing them no matter how many times they are debunked.
As Trump enters the post-Labor Day sprint of his 2024 campaign for the presidency, his commentary is filled with many of the same false claims he made as president from 2017 to 2021. He’s even repeating some of the false claims he used during his 2016 presidential campaign.
Trump keeps deploying his old favorites
As a fact-check reporter for CNN, I watch or read the transcript of every public appearance by Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris’ campaign remarks to date have been heavy on thematic rhetoric and light on assertions of fact, with a smattering of false or misleading claims, Trump’s 2024 interviews and speeches are littered with old falsehoods I’ve come to call “the repeats” – assertions I have fact-checked as false over and over for years.
For example, Trump falsely claimed on a podcast last week that people are saying global warming will cause the oceans to rise just “an eighth of an inch in 355 years.” He was saying near-identical nonsense in 2019. (Sea levels are already rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.)
Trump falsely claimed at a rally last month that his tariffs on imported Chinese goods are paid by China, not Americans, and that no previous president had generated even “10 cents” from tariffs on Chinese goods. He was saying the same in 2018. (The tariff payments are made by US importers, not Chinese exporters, and the US government was already generating billions per year from such tariffs before Trump took office.)

Trump falsely claimed in a speech in mid-August that he had warned the US not to invade Iraq. That claim was a key part of his campaign pitch in 2015 and 2016. (Trump expressed tentative support for the 2003 invasion about six months before it occurred, did not express a firm opinion on an invasion about two months before it occurred, and only came out as an opponent of the war post-invasion.)
Trump’s false claims in the podcast interview last week that some NATO members were “delinquent” and “owed … huge amounts of money” before he took office were also staples of his 2016 run. (NATO members didn’t owe anybody money even if they were not meeting the alliance’s voluntary 2%-of-GDP guideline for their own defense spending.)
Trump’s regular false claims of a “rigged” 2020 election echo his language from both his 2016 campaign and 2020 campaign. (The claims were baseless then and are baseless now.)
And less importantly, when Trump declared in June, July and again on Thursday that he had been named “Man of the Year” in Michigan long before he entered politics, it was the third straight presidential election he had told this silly lie he debuted in 2016. (There is no evidence the award even exists, let alone that Trump, who has never lived in Michigan, received it.)
How the repetition works for Trump – and doesn’t
Nobody really knows how much of Trump’s deployment of old lies is strategic and how much is mere force of habit. Regardless, his persistence produces a clear benefit for him.
News outlets tend to focus on new material. While some outlets may be inclined to fact-check a false Trump claim the first, second, third or even 10th time he utters it, they are far less likely to devote precious resources to a claim on the 100th or 150th utterance – especially because he is constantly mixing in dozens of new lies that require time and resources to address. And so, by virtue of shameless perseverance, Trump often manages to outlast most of the media’s willingness to correct any particular falsehood, eventually getting that claim into news coverage and social media clips nearly uncorrected.
That’s not to say his lying is an unmitigated victory.
Numerous polls have found for years that a clear majority of voters do not see Trump as honest; from talking to Americans around the country since 2015, I know there are a lot of people who distrust almost anything he says. I have no doubt that his insistence on continuing to say dozens of things people have already learned are false is part of the reason why.
Still, I try to match Trump’s tirelessness in lying with my own tirelessness in challenging the lies. The separation of fact from fiction is central to journalists’ role in the democratic process, and there are always citizens out there who are hearing even the stalest of deceptions for the first time.
So as long as Trump or any other major political figure keeps reviving their past nonsense, we should keep debunking that nonsense. Even if we already did it eight years ago.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/03/politics/trump-fact-checking-analysis/index.html
51,Fact Check,2024,8,Fact check: New Trump ad uses edited quote to attack nonexistent Harris immigration proposal,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
A new television ad from former President Donald Trump’s campaign piles deception upon deception to attack Vice President Kamala Harris on immigration. The ad uses an edited quote to attack Harris over a supposed proposal that she hasn’t actually made.
The ad features a narrator saying this: “Attention seniors: Kamala Harris has promised amnesty for the 10 million illegals she allowed in as border czar, making them eligible for Social Security. Studies warn this will lead to cuts in your Social Security benefits.” A quote shown on the screen, which the ad attributes to the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that favors reduced immigration, says this: “Harris’ amnesty imposes large cost on Social Security.”
Facts First: The ad’s claims are false. Harris has not made any promise to grant legal status to all of the migrants who have crossed the border during her vice presidency. Though she has expressed support for a pathway to citizenship for some unspecified group of undocumented people, she has never said that recent migrants should be included. And Harris’ name does not appear in the actual Center for Immigration Studies quote about the likely cost of “amnesty” to Social Security; the center says it hasn’t analyzed a specific 2024 amnesty proposal from Harris because it hasn’t seen her make a specific proposal.
There are other problems with the ad, too.
Harris was never “border czar.” Rather, she was given a diplomatic role focused on addressing the “root causes” of migration from three Central American countries, not put in charge of border security. You can read a longer fact-check of that claim here.
And the ad’s claim that 10 million migrants have been “allowed in” during Harris’ vice presidency is an exaggeration. Though there have been roughly 10 million official border “encounters” with migrants nationwide during the Biden-Harris administration, that “encounters” figure includes people who were rapidly kicked out of the country. It also counts each attempt at entry by an individual who tried more than once.
Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director for the Migration Policy Institute think tank that researches immigration policy, told CNN that the actual number of people let into the country under the Biden-Harris administration would be around six million, not 10 million, even if you used a generous estimate that counts people let in under designated parole programs for Ukrainians and Afghans; counts people permitted to lawfully fly into the country under a program for people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela; and counts every “encounter” at the northern border as a successful entry even though we know it was not.
What Harris has said vs. what the ad claims
Regardless of the number, though, it’s clear that Harris has not promised to grant “amnesty” to all of the migrants who have come into the country during her vice presidency.
“We are unfamiliar with any statement by Kamala Harris that she has promised to amnesty border arrivals allowed into the country since January 2021,” Mittelstadt said in an email.
Harris has not released many policy specifics on immigration since she became the Democratic presidential candidate in late July, when President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. During Harris’ speech at the Democratic National Convention in August, she pledged to sign a bipartisan border security bill Trump had helped to kill earlier this year, and she said, “I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border.”
That “earned pathway to citizenship” language makes clear that, as Harris has said before, she wants to provide legal status to some group of undocumented people. But here’s the key: it is simply not clear which group of undocumented people she now wants to include. Her campaign declined to comment this week.
While it’s theoretically possible Harris could eventually propose amnesty for every undocumented person in the country, various “amnesty” proposals do not cover the entire undocumented population – and many include a time restriction that excludes the most recent arrivals.
For example, when Harris was running for president in 2019, she proposed a pathway to citizenship for many “Dreamers,” undocumented people who arrived in the US as children, not for all undocumented people. And an executive action Biden announced in June, which has been paused by a judge, seeks to give legal status to the undocumented spouses and children of US citizens without making them leave the country to wait – but the spouses must have lived in the US for 10 years or more to qualify.
So what is the Trump campaign’s source for the claim that Harris has specifically promised “amnesty” for the migrants who have arrived during her vice presidency?
When CNN asked the campaign for comment, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt responded in an email: “Kamala supports amnesty. She always has! Has she said otherwise? NO!” The example Leavitt cited was a bill Biden sent to Congress on the first day of the Biden-Harris administration in 2021, which Leavitt noted the Democrats’ 2024 platform continues to promote.
That bill, however, does not corroborate the ad’s claim that Harris has promised “amnesty” to the people who have arrived during her vice presidency. With some limited exceptions, the bill requires an undocumented person to have been in the US by the first day of 2021 to be eligible for a pathway to citizenship. If Harris simply re-proposed this bill, the migrants who arrived during her vice presidency – from January 20, 2021 onward – would not be eligible.
The supposed quote from the Center for Immigration Studies
Asked for comment, the Center for Immigration Studies made clear that the quote the Trump ad attributes to the center – “Harris’ amnesty imposes large cost on Social Security” – is not an actual quote from the organization.
“We have many different cost estimates for various amnesties. We have done work on the costs to retirement programs in particular and that appears to be what the ads refers to. But we have not done anything specific on Harris’ proposal,” Steven Camarota, the organization’s director of research, said in a Tuesday email to CNN.
The analysis Camarota linked to, from 2021, was headlined “Amnesty Would Impose Large Costs on Social Security and Medicare.” Contrary to the quote in the ad, the analysis never mentioned Harris.
Camarota was not particularly critical of the Trump campaign for adding Harris’ name to the quote. In a follow-up interview with CNN on Wednesday, Camarota said that Harris has been supportive of “amnesty” proposals in the past, has signaled her support for some sort of amnesty during this campaign, and that “it’s very difficult to imagine” that any such Harris program “would exclude the recent arrivals.”
Still, arguing that a future Harris program is likely to include this group is significantly different from claiming, as the ad does, that Harris has already “promised” to include this group.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/politics/fact-check-trump-ad-harris-immigration/index.html

CNN
 — 
Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris and vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sat down with CNN anchor Dana Bash on Thursday for the first formal interview of their campaign.
Bash directed most of the questions to Harris. Here is a fact check of some of Harris’ responses, including a misleading statement and an exaggeration.
Harris’ stance on fracking
Bash noted that Harris said, while running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” When Bash asked if she still wants to ban fracking, Harris responded: “No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020 – that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking.”
RELATED ARTICLE
Key lines from CNN’s interview with VP Kamala Harris, her first as the Democratic nominee
When Bash again noted that Harris said in 2019 that she supported a ban on fracking, and asked Harris if she changed her mind during that campaign (which Harris ended in December 2019), Harris said, “In 2020, I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024 and I’ve not changed that position, nor will I going forward.”
Facts First: This is misleading. Harris did not make her position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence; Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate. Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president.
Harris said in the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking”; “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.”
It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Thursday, neither of these 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior.
The child tax credit and poverty
Harris touted the impact of the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief bill Biden signed into law in 2021, which included a temporary enhancement of the child tax credit. She referred to “when we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit, so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%.”
Facts First: The word “over,” which Harris said very quietly, makes this claim a slight exaggeration; the American Rescue Plan’s temporary expansion of the child tax credit helped reduce child poverty by 46%, by one key federal measure, between 2020 and 2021. In addition, it’s important to note that this steep improvement only lasted for the one year the temporary enhancement was in effect. The child poverty rate then spiked in 2022, the most recent year for which public data is currently available. 
The American Rescue Plan increased the size of the child tax credit to up to $3,600 – from $2,000 – for eligible families. The law also enabled many more low-income parents to claim the credit and distributed half of the credit on a monthly basis.
These changes helped send child poverty (as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure) to a record low 5.2% in 2021, a drop of 46% from 2020, when the rate was 9.7% according to the US Census Bureau. But in 2022, child poverty soared to 12.4%, roughly comparable to where it was prior to the pandemic in 2019. That was the largest jump in child poverty since the Supplemental Poverty Measure began.
Harris is now calling to restore the $3,600 credit as well as create a new $6,000 credit for newborns.
Clean energy jobs
Touting the Biden-Harris administration’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a major climate law for which Harris cast the tiebreaking vote in the Senate, Harris spoke of “what we’ve already done, creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs.”
Facts First: This needs context. While it’s clear that a significant number of new clean energy jobs were created as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act, the “300,000” figure includes jobs that companies have promised to create but aren’t finalized. And other counts of new clean energy jobs have come up with smaller figures.
The 300,000 estimate comes from a June tally by communications group Climate Power. It was compiled by adding up the jobs promised by companies in publicly announcing 585 clean energy projects after the Inflation Reduction Act was passed through May 2024, a total of 312,900 announced jobs. Not all of these jobs have already been created. Climate Power’s topline number also doesn’t distinguish between construction jobs building new factories and the long-term jobs at those factories – jobs building batteries, solar panels and electric vehicles, among other things.
In addition, E2, another clean energy group that tracks Inflation Reduction Act-related investments and jobs, has counted over 109,000 new clean energy jobs created or announced from August 2022 to May 2024 – significantly lower than the Climate Power number. A recent report from the US Department of Energy found 142,000 new clean energy jobs were created in 2023.
Different entities use different methodologies when analyzing data, so it is difficult to determine an exact figure. Regardless, there’s no question there’s a huge amount of clean energy investment, and a significant number of new jobs building EVs and renewables like wind and solar are being created by the Inflation Reduction Act. The 2024 Energy Department report showed clean energy jobs made up more than half of the total for new energy sector jobs and grew at a rate twice as large as the overall US economy.
The report also acknowledged how the sudden growth in the clean energy sector from the Inflation Reduction Act has made it difficult to track all the jobs that are being created.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/fact-checking-harris-cnn-interview/index.html

CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump keeps lying that “everybody,” including Democrats, wanted the Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that had guaranteed abortion rights around the country since 1973.
“Every Democrat, every Republican, everybody wanted Roe v. Wade terminated and brought back to the states,” Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, said on Fox News on Thursday morning.
“Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v. Wade TERMINATED, and brought back to the States,” he wrote on social media on Thursday night.
Trump, facing criticism for appointing three of the justices who overturned Roe in 2022, has been delivering versions of this “everybody” claim for months. But the claim is an up-is-down reversal of reality, especially the part about the views of Democrats.
Facts First: It’s not even close to true that “everybody” or “every Democrat” wanted Roe overturned. A large majority of Americans and an overwhelming majority of Democrats wanted the Supreme Court to preserve Roe in 2022, according to numerous polls. Democratic support for Roe exceeded 80% in many polls and 90% in some polls.
“So this is a claim that is unusually brazen in how false it is,” said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis and an expert on the history of abortion politics.
The numbers debunk Trump’s lie
The specific numbers vary poll by poll, but numerous polls before and after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe have arrived at broadly similar findings: strong overall support for Roe and even stronger Democratic support for Roe.
For example, a CNN poll conducted by SSRS in January 2022, roughly five months before the Supreme Court ruling, found that 69% of adults and 86% of Democrats were opposed to completely overturning Roe. In CNN polling going back to 1989, adults’ support for completely overturning Roe had never exceeded 36%.
A NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll in May 2022, after a draft of the court’s opinion overturning Roe was leaked, found that 64% of adults and 93% of Democrats opposed overturning Roe.
A Pew Research Center poll conducted in late June and early July 2022, days after the Supreme Court ruling, found that 57% of adults and 82% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents disapproved of the ruling. An NBC News poll conducted in June 2023, roughly a year after the ruling, found that 61% of registered voters and 92% of Democratic registered voters opposed the ruling.
A CNN poll conducted by SSRS in April 2024 found that 65% of adults and 87% of Democrats disapproved of the Supreme Court ruling.
Trump’s false “everybody” claim has been debunked since the spring. So has his related false claim – which he repeated in the Fox News interview Thursday – that “every legal scholar” wanted Roe overturned. Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request to explain why he is still making such comments.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/27/politics/fact-check-trump-keeps-saying-everybody-wanted-roe-overturned/index.html
54,Fact Check,2024,8,Fact check: How Trump uses a deceptive chart to lie about the border,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump keeps displaying a chart that includes a significant lie. And he keeps citing that deceptive chart to deliver his own lie about immigration trends in his last year in office.
The chart – the one Trump had fortunately turned his head to look at when a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in July – is a bar chart about the monthly number of official encounters with migrants at the southern border. It features a large red arrow pointing to a month with a particularly small bar. And it says in red text beside that arrow: “TRUMP LEAVES OFFICE. LOWEST ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IN RECORDED HISTORY!”
The monthly bars get bigger right after that, insinuating that illegal immigration suddenly began rising from a Trump record low when President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn in. And on numerous occasions, including in his recent public conversation with billionaire supporter Elon Musk, Trump has declared that the chart shows that the record low was set in his very last week in office.
“You see the arrow on the bottom, the red arrow on the bottom, that’s the lowest point. That was the week I left office. Look what happened after I left office. Look at that,” Trump said at a rally earlier this month in Montana.
“If you look at the arrow on the bottom, that’s the lowest level, the one on the bottom, heavy red arrow – that’s the lowest level of illegal immigrants ever to come into our country in recorded history, right there, right there. And that was my last week in office. And then you see what happened after I left. Look at the rest,” Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention in July.
But that’s not true.
Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. Illegal immigration was not at its lowest point in history in Trump’s last week in office in January 2021 – and contrary to the text on the chart, the red arrow does not actually point to January 2021. Rather, the arrow points to April 2020, when Trump still had more than eight months left in his term and global migration had slowed to a trickle because of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. After hitting a roughly three-year low (not an all-time low) in April 2020, migration numbers at the southern border increased each and every month through the end of Trump’s term. 
In other words, the number of Border Patrol migrant encounters in between ports of entry at the southern border – a figure often used as a proxy for unauthorized border-crossings – had been rising for about three-quarters of a year when Biden and Harris took over from Trump.
The numbers did spike under Biden and Harris, but this increase represented an acceleration, not a reversal, of the upward trend at the end of the Trump era.
What the numbers show
The number of Border Patrol migrant encounters in between ports of entry at the southern border fell to 16,182 in April 2020, the month after the Covid-19 pandemic was declared. That was the lowest monthly number in about three years, not in US history; the monthly number was lower in four separate months earlier in Trump’s term, March through June 2017, including a Trump-era low of 11,127 in April 2017. (The number of Border Patrol encounters at the southern border was also much lower in the early 1960s, but distant historical comparisons are complicated by significant differences in laws, policies and staffing levels.)
Then, after April 2020, Border Patrol migrant encounters at the southern border rose in each of Trump’s remaining eight full months in office – plus a ninth month, January 2021, in which he was president for most of the month.
The size of the bars on Trump’s chart appear to be roughly correct, though it’s impossible to tell if they’re precisely accurate. But the red arrow purporting to show when Trump left office is clearly in the wrong spot.
Trump’s false claim that the red arrow points to the week he left office has been fact-checked repeatedly, including by FactCheck.org after he used the chart at a rally in Wisconsin in April. But Trump has never stopped making the false claim; in his Republican National Convention speech in July, he delivered it as the chart was displayed on multiple screens above him and beside him.
Asked why Trump continues to repeat the false claim, campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not respond directly on Monday. Instead, she credited a variety of Trump border policies for the low level of illegal immigration in 2020.
Other inaccurate claims
As PolitiFact reported in July, Trump’s chart appears to be based on a chart from Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Johnson told Fox News in July that he showed Trump his chart on a plane trip to a rally in Wisconsin in April, gave it to Trump’s staff after Trump liked it, and then “they made a few changes in terms of graphics.”
But the changes that appear on Trump’s chart include significant inaccuracies.
Johnson’s chart does not include the red arrow pointing to April 2020 or the red text wrongly claiming that the arrow points to when Trump left office. Johnson’s chart also does not include other false or unsupported statements on Trump’s chart.
For example, text at the top of Trump’s chart, which Johnson’s chart doesn’t have, claims that “MANY” of the migrants who have arrived under Biden are “FROM PRISONS AND MENTAL INSTITUTIONS,” a frequent Trump claim that he has never corroborated and that experts say is baseless. Text added to the top of Trump’s chart also claims the chart shows “ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION” numbers even though the text at the top of Johnson’s version shows that his chart includes migrants who arrived at legal ports of entry and were turned away.
Johnson’s office did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Monday. Leavitt did not respond to a request to address whether Trump’s staff added the inaccuracies to the chart.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/26/politics/fact-check-trump-immigration-chart/index.html

 — 
During a Friday speech announcing the suspension of his independent presidential campaign, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made a wildly inaccurate claim about the extent to which President Joe Biden was mentioned at the Republican National Convention in July.
Kennedy sought to portray the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week as insufficiently focused on substance and overly fixated on style and on former President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate to whom Kennedy said he was throwing his support.
Kennedy said: “In Chicago, a string of Democratic speakers mentioned Donald Trump 147 times just on the first day … Who needs a policy when you have Trump to hate? In contrast, at the RNC convention, President Biden was mentioned only twice in four days.”
Facts First: Kennedy’s claim about Biden mentions at the Republican National Convention is not even close to true. A New York Times analysis of all the speeches at the RNC found that the word “Biden” was spoken a total of 393 times. The Republican vice presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance, said the word “Biden” 12 times in his own convention speech.
Trump himself said “Biden” twice in his convention speech (during a single reference), but Kennedy’s claim was about the Republicans’ four-day gathering as a whole.
The false claim that Biden was mentioned a total of twice over the four days of the Republican convention has been circulating on social media this week. It is not clear where the claim originated, but a quick transcript search of the speeches made by just some RNC speakers proves it is inaccurate.
For example, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said “Biden” nine times in his convention speech; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said “Biden” eight times; Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the United Nations, said “Biden” seven times, as did Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida; Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. said “Biden” four times, as did US Senate candidate Kari Lake of Arizona.
And these figures include only explicit mentions of Biden. Various convention speakers bashed the president without invoking his name.

 — 
The fourth and final night of the Democratic National Convention focused more on biography, big themes, subjective arguments and uncheckable promises and predictions rather than factual assertions.
Here is a fact check of five claims Vice President Kamala Harris made in her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, plus one claim by a Democratic senator.
Harris on the Supreme Court immunity decision
In her speech accepting the Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris mentioned the Supreme Court’s July decision on presidential immunity while warning about the “consequences” of giving former President Donald Trump another term.
“Consider the power he will have – especially after the United States Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution,” Harris said. “Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.”
Facts First: This needs context. The Supreme Court ruling last month did not grant Trump or former presidents in general total immunity from criminal prosecution, though it did grant them immunity for many of their activities in office.
The court ruled that a former president has “absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for actions within his conclusive and preclusive constitutional authority” and is “entitled to at least presumptive immunity from prosecution for all his official acts” – but also ruled that “there is no immunity for unofficial acts.”
It’s fair for Harris to frame the ruling as an expansion of presidential power. But the ruling did not kill the ongoing criminal prosecutions against Trump, let alone prohibit any future criminal prosecutions against him.
A federal prosecution over Trump’s attempts to overturn the result of the 2020 election is back in the hands of a district court judge, who must decide which of the alleged Trump acts at issue are official and which are unofficial. And a state-level election subversion prosecution against Trump is also alive in Georgia, though it is on hold amid a battle over whether the district attorney leading the case should be disqualified.
In May, before the Supreme Court ruling, Trump was found guilty of felony falsification of business records in a state-level prosecution in New York. The presiding judge is now considering how the ruling applies to that case, in which Trump is awaiting sentencing.

Harris on Trump restricting abortion
Harris said that if Trump were to become president again, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion; enact a nationwide abortion ban; force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions “with or without Congress”; and create a national anti-abortion coordinator. “Simply put,” she said, “they are out of their minds.”
Facts First: Harris is making a prediction that we cannot definitively fact check, but Trump himself has not, during this campaign, endorsed these policies she said he would implement as president. Many of the policies are proposed in Project 2025, a conservative think tank’s set of policy preferences for a next Republican administration.
Over the past couple decades, Trump’s position has shifted several times on abortion restrictions.
On Truth Social Thursday, Trump wrote “I do not limit access to birth control or I.V.F. - THAT IS A LIE, these are all false stories that she’s making up, that I’ve never even heard of. It’s just words coming out of her mouth.”
Trump regularly boasts about how he appointed the justices to the US Supreme Court that overturned the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed pregnant people the right to an abortion in the United States.
Even in this latest campaign, Trump has repeatedly ducked direct questions about his support for a federal ban, and polls show that the majority of Americans are not in favor of a federal abortion ban. Polls also show Republicans and Democrats largely believe that access to birth control should be widely available. Possibly reflecting those sentiments, in April, Trump said directly that he would not sign a national abortion ban if reelected to the White House. Trump also said the decision to ban abortion should be left up to the states. In July, the Republican National Committee softened language on abortion that better reflected those views.
Trump’s current position on abortion reversed what he said in 2016 when he was first running for the presidency and was the opposite of statements he made throughout his time in office.
Some scholars are concerned that conservative advisers to Trump have encouraged him to ban abortions by enforcing the 1873 Comstock Act. By enforcing this Victorian-era anti-vice law that is still on the books, but is not currently enforced, he could create a national ban and bypass the need for legislation.
The Comstock law specifically bans the mailing of “obscene” materials used to produce an abortion. Some scholars believe Trump could use the Justice Department to enforce a ban that would not just restrict people from sending the medication currently used in the majority of abortions through the mail, but would ban any kind of materials used to produce any kind of abortion. The Comstock law has also been used to ban birth control.
Trump has not officially endorsed the enforcement of the Comstock Act, but it is a strategy some of his advisers have outlined, including former advisers who created Project 2025; the Heritage Foundation’s plan for the next Republican administration. Trump has not endorsed Project 2025.
In an interview with CBS on Monday, when asked if he would enforce the Comstock Act, Trump said that “specifics” remained to be determined, but that he “generally” wouldn’t enforce the act’s prohibition against pills used for an abortion. Trump has not elaborated on what “generally” means, but he did add that “the federal government should have nothing to do with this issue.”

Harris on Trump raising prices for families by $4,000 a year
Harris claimed in her Thursday speech at the Democratic National Convention that Trump’s proposed policies would raise prices for American families. “He intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax, call it a ‘Trump Tax,’ that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year,” she said.
Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House. 
Trump has called for adding a tariff of 10% to 20% on all imports from all countries, as well as another tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.
Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank.
If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP.
Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households.

Harris on Trump giving tax breaks to the wealthy
Harris on Thursday said Trump fights for the wealthy, not the middle class.
“Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends, and he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt,” Harris said during her remarks at the Democratic National Convention.
Facts First: Harris is referring to Trump’s vow to extend the provisions of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that expire next year. Her claim is mostly true, though extending the provisions would also help Americans who are not wealthy.
The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of Trump’s key achievements in office, reduced taxes for most people, though the rich benefited far more than others. If the expiring provisions are made permanent, the highest-income households would receive more than 45% of the benefits, according to a July analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.
If the law’s provisions are made permanent, households making at least $450,000 – roughly the top 5% – would be the biggest winners, the analysis found. They would see their after-tax income increase by 3.2%. For those in the top 1%, who make at least $1 million, that boost equates to a tax cut of about $70,000, on average, in 2027.
Middle-income households earning between roughly $65,000 and $116,000, on the other hand, would receive a tax cut of about $1,000, or 1.3% of their income, the analysis found.
Overall, extending the 2017 tax law provisions would reduce taxes for about three-quarters of households but hike them for about 10%, according to the analysis.
As for the impact on the national debt, extending the individual income and estate tax cuts, extending or maintaining some of the law’s corporate tax changes, and taking interest into account would increase the deficit by more than $4.6 trillion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Sen. Casey overstates the role corporations have played in driving inflation
Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey highlighted Harris’ recently announced plan to put in place anti-price gouging laws in an effort to lower the cost of food, saying Thursday at the Democratic National Convention, “Prices are up because these corporations are scheming to drive them up.”
Facts First: Casey’s remark lacks key context and overstates the role corporations have played in driving inflation, according to two papers published by regional Federal Reserve banks. 
The papers published by the two banks suggest corporations contributed to the inflation Americans have experienced in recent years; however, their pricing actions weren’t the primary driver of inflation when it peaked at a four-decade high in 2022.
Research published by the Kansas City Fed last year found that corporate profits, which grew significantly in the first half of 2021 as firms raised prices at a faster pace than their costs were increasing, could have accounted for more than half the inflation Americans experienced that year. But by 2022, the rate at which corporations raised prices compared with their costs declined.
The researchers concluded that corporations likely raised prices in 2020 and the early part of 2021 in anticipation of rising future costs. But price hikes corporations put forth then were not the main source of inflation in 2022.
Research published by the San Francisco Fed earlier this year reached a similar conclusion: that alleged corporate price gouging was not a primary catalyst for the inflation surge that occurred in 2021 and 2022.
Ultimately, the inflation Americans have had to contend with over the past few years is the product of a confluence of events, including the war in Ukraine, government spending and pandemic-related disruptions across the economy. The unprecedented stress on supply chains in the thick of the pandemic, for example, contributed significantly to inflation’s rise in early 2021.
However, research from progressive think tanks, such as Groundwork Collaborative, suggests there’s a more direct link between corporation raising prices and higher inflation.

 — 
For the second straight night, there were few false or misleading claims at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday. Speakers tended to stick to factual statements, thematic rhetoric, personal stories and uncheckable predictions.
There were, however, two false claims on a central focus of Democrats’ attacks: a conservative think tank initiative known as Project 2025.
Here is a fact check of those claims, plus checks of two other remarks speakers made on Wednesday.

Colorado governor makes false claim about Project 2025
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis joined other speakers at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday in attacking Project 2025, an effort by dozens of conservative organizations, led by the Heritage Foundation think tank, to lay the groundwork for the next Republican presidency.
After holding up what he said was a copy of the 920-page Project 2025 policy document, which is called “Mandate for Leadership,” Polis said at one point: “Page 451 says the only legitimate family is a married mother and father, where only the father works.”
Facts First: Polis’ claim is false. Though the Project 2025 policy document argues for the importance of the “nuclear” family made up of a married mother and father, it does not say that this is the only “legitimate” family – and it certainly does not say that a family with a working mother is illegitimate. Polis’ inaccurate claim echoes an online meme that was debunked last month by Snopes, USA Today and others.
Mary Vought, vice president of strategic communications for the Heritage Foundation, told CNN in a message on Wednesday night: “As a working mother myself, I know this claim is simply a lie. The Mandate for Leadership says nothing about which families are ‘legitimate.’ If Gov. Polis actually read the page he cited, he would know that.”
What Page 451 actually says
It is true that Project 2025 expresses a preference for a certain type of family – the married “nuclear family” with a mother and father. On the page Polis mentioned, the document asserts that “families comprised of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of a well-ordered nation and healthy society”; that “working fathers are essential to the well-being and development of their children”; and that “homes with non-related ‘boyfriends’ present are among the most dangerous place for a child to be.”
The same page of the document criticizes the Biden administration’s Department of Health and Human Services for supposedly “focusing on ‘LGBTQ+ equity,’ subsidizing single-motherhood, disincentivizing work, and penalizing marriage,” and it says, “these policies should be repealed and replaced by policies that support the formation of stable, married, nuclear families.” (We won’t address the accuracy of Project 2025’s own claims in this fact check.)
But the page does not say, as Polis claimed, that there is only one kind of “legitimate” family – let alone say that families in which a mother has a job do not qualify.

Congresswoman falsely claims Trump wrote Project 2025
On the third night of the Democratic National Convention, speakers continued to attack Project 2025, an effort by dozens of conservative organizations, led by the Heritage Foundation think tank, to lay the policy groundwork for the next Republican presidency.
The initiative produced a 920-page document, called “Mandate for Leadership,” that proposes both a variety of right-wing policy changes and a major overhaul of the executive branch that would significantly increase presidential power.
Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, who is also a US Senate candidate, said Wednesday of former President Donald Trump: “He has with his friends said the quiet parts out loud – but not only said it out loud, he wrote a book about it. What’s it called? Project 2025.”
Facts First: The claim that Trump “wrote” Project 2025 is false. There is no evidence that Trump was personally involved in writing the Project 2025 policy document, let alone that it was his own “book.” He is not among the document’s listed authors, editors and contributors, though dozens of people who served in his administration are on the list.
CNN reported in July that at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to the policy document. But noting that Trump has extensive ties to Project 2025 is significantly different than claiming that Trump actually wrote Project 2025.
Noah Weinrich, a spokesperson for Project 2025, said in a message to CNN on Wednesday night: “Project 2025 is not affiliated with any candidate, and no candidate was involved with the drafting of the Mandate for Leadership, which was published by Heritage in April 2023.”
Trump has said that some of the document is “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” but also said “many of the points are fine.” He has not specified which proposals he rejects and which he finds acceptable.

Former President Bill Clinton speaks at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 21, 2024. Bernadette Tuazon/CNN
Clinton’s claim about Democrats being responsible for 50 million jobs created since 1989
Former President Bill Clinton highlighted the jobs created in the US “since the end of the Cold War in 1989,” noting that of the 51 million jobs added, 50 million of those were created during Democratic administrations.
“Since the end of the Cold War in 1989, America has created about 51 million new jobs. I swear, I checked this three times; even I couldn’t believe it. What’s the score? Democrats 50, Republicans 1,” he said during his remarks at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday.
Facts First: Clinton’s claim is true, although aspects such as timing, rounding, and large-scale national crises influence the math.
First, it depends on when the clock starts: From January 1989 through July 2024, the US economy added a net 51.825 million jobs, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics seasonally adjusted data.
In tabulating the monthly job totals, and starting in February for the respective presidential administrations, there were 50.281 million jobs added during Democratic administrations and 1.544 million jobs added during Republican administrations (including January 1989’s 263,000 net gain, as that was the end of Republican President Ronald Reagan’s term). The totals vary slightly if the presidential terms are started in January (49.985 million for Democratic presidents and 1.84 million for Republican presidents).
However, presidential terms don’t start and end in a vacuum, and economic cycles can carry over regardless of party. Additionally, the ups and downs of the labor market and the broader economy are influenced by factors beyond a single president (although specific economic policies can influence economic and job growth).
Clinton’s data point also leaves out some very important externalities: the dot-com bubble, 9/11, the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic. Job losses, which were  sometimes massive, were prevalent during those national crises and respective downturns.

Jeffries’ claim about Trump’s tax cuts
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries made a claim Wednesday that has been delivered for years by various Democrats, including President Joe Biden.
In Jeffries’ remarks at the Democratic National Convention, the New York Democrat said of former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cut law: “Trump was the mastermind of the GOP tax scam, where 83% of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1% in America.”
Facts First: Jeffries’ claim needs context. It’s not true that the top 1% have already gotten 83% of the benefits of the tax cuts since Trump signed them into law in late 2017. Rather, the 83% figure is a 2017 estimate from the Tax Policy Center think tank of the percentage of the benefits the top 1% of taxpayers would get in the future, in 2027, in the event that the law’s individual tax cuts (which were designed as temporary) are allowed to expire at the end of 2025 without an extension and that the law’s corporate tax cuts (which were designed as permanent) continued. 
The benefits breakdown is much different while the individual tax cuts and corporate tax cuts are both in place. The Tax Policy Center estimated in 2017 that in 2025, the top 1% of taxpayers would get about 25% of the benefits. That is still a very large chunk, but nowhere near 83%.

58,Fact Check,2024,8,Fact check: Trump falsely claims Harris met with Putin before Ukraine invasion,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump falsely claimed Wednesday that his Democratic opponent in the presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin just days before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.
Trump said in a speech in North Carolina: “Remember when Biden sent Kamala to Europe to stop the war in Ukraine. She met with Putin, and then three days later, he attacked. How did she do? Do you think she did a good job? She met with Putin to tell him, ‘Don’t do it.’ And three days later, he attacked; that’s when the attack started. Did you know that, General?” (Retired Army Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg was at the North Carolina event.)
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Harris has never met with Putin. In reality, she met with US allies, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, at the Munich Security Conference in the days before Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Putin was not at the conference.
“Frankly speaking, I cannot recall a single contact between President Putin and Mrs. Harris,” a Kremlin spokesperson said last month, according to a state-owned Russian news agency.
The Biden administration was still trying to deter an invasion of Ukraine at the time of Harris’ 2022 trip to the conference in Germany, but top administration officials, including President Joe Biden himself, made clear that they believed Putin was already moving toward invading. As Harris was on her way to Germany, Biden told reporters that he thought a Russian attack “will happen in the next several days.”
CNN reported on the day the Munich conference began that a senior administration official said Harris had three key objectives: “Focus on the ‘fast-changing’ situation on the ground, maintain full alignment with partners and send a clear message to Russia that the US prefers diplomacy but is ready in case of Russian aggression.”
The Munich conference was held from February 18 to February 20, 2022; Russia began its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/21/politics/fact-check-trump-harris-putin-meeting-ukraine/index.html
59,Fact Check,2024,8,Fact-checking night 2 of the Democratic National Convention,,"CNN
 — 
There were few false or misleading claims on the second night of the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday. Speakers generally made factual statements, told personal stories, expressed subjective opinions or offered uncheckable predictions.
Here is a fact check of one false claim, one misleading claim and one claim that left out some important context – plus some context about Project 2025, a conservative think tank initiative that has been repeatedly invoked by convention speakers.
Democrats on Trump and Project 2025
Various Democratic National Convention speakers have invoked Project 2025, saying or hinting that this project is former President Donald Trump’s own agenda. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont referred to “Trump’s Project 2025.”  State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Pennsylvania used the same phrase. Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, talking about Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, referred to “their Project 2025 agenda.”
Here is some context about the project, Trump’s links to it, and what Trump has said about it.
What Project 2025 is: Project 2025 has been led by The Heritage Foundation, a prominent conservative think tank, working in collaboration with dozens of other conservative organizations. Their efforts, which began in 2022, resulted in a detailed 920-page document, called “Mandate for Leadership: The Conservative Promise,” that lays out “hundreds of clear and concrete policy recommendations for White House offices, Cabinet departments, Congress, and agencies, commissions, and boards.”
The document proposes a variety of right-wing policy changes in a variety of policy areas, from immigration to health care to agriculture to education, plus a major overhaul of the executive branch that would significantly increase presidential power.
Member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives Malcolm Kenyatta holds a ""Project 2025"" book while speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on August 20, 2024. Bernadette Tuazon/CNN
The document was published in April 2023, when Trump was a heavy favorite to win the party nomination but nearly a year before he had actually secured that nomination. The document bills itself as an attempt to help “the next conservative President, whoever he or she may be,” hit the ground running if and when they are inaugurated in 2025.
Trump’s links to the initiative: Project 2025 has emphasized that it is “not affiliated with former President Trump.” Trump claimed in July that “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it.”
CNN cannot definitively fact check what Trump might or might not know. But it’s clear that Trump has extensive connections to Project 2025.
A large number of people who served in Trump’s administration were involved in crafting Project 2025. CNN reported in July that at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in the project, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to the policy document. For example, six of Trump’s former Cabinet secretaries played a role in the project. So did Tom Homan, the acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief early in the Trump administration, whom Trump has recently said he plans to make part of a second Trump administration.
Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance wrote the foreword for a forthcoming book by a leader of Project 2025, Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts. A Vance spokesperson told Axios in July that “the foreword has nothing to do with Project 2025” and that Vance has “previously said that he has no involvement with” Project 2025 “and has plenty of disagreements with what they’re calling for.”
Trump’s stance on Project 2025 proposals: It’s not clear how much of the extensive Project 2025 policy document Trump supports and how much he rejects. Trump has said that some of the document is “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,” but he has also said “many of the points are fine.” He has not specified which proposals he rejects and which he finds acceptable.
Russell Vought, the Trump-era Office of Management and Budget director who is one of the former Trump administration officials involved in Project 2025, said last month in a hidden-camera video secretly recorded by a British journalism organization: “I see what he’s doing is just very, very conscious distancing himself from a brand. It’s interesting, he’s in fact not even opposing himself to a particular policy.”
CNN reported in July: “Project 2025 includes many policy priorities that are aligned with those of the former president, especially as they relate to cracking down on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracy by making it easier to dismiss civil servants and career officials. But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn’t explicitly backed,” including a ban on pornography and the exclusion of the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act.
A spokesperson for Trump’s campaign told CNN in August: “President Trump’s campaign made it clear that only President Trump and the campaign, and NOT any other organization or former staff, represent policies for the second term.”

Sanders on unemployment during the Covid-19 pandemic
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders on Tuesday reminded Democratic National Convention attendees of the dark times in the US during the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Remember where we were three-and-a-half years ago. We were in the midst of the worst public health crisis in 100 years and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression,” Sanders said. “Unemployment was soaring.”
“That was the reality the Biden-Harris administration faced as they entered the Oval Office,” he continued.

Facts First: Sanders’ claim about the labor market at the start of the Biden administration is not true. While the unemployment rate skyrocketed in April 2020 at the start of the pandemic, the situation was improving by the time President Joe Biden took office in January 2021.
The nation’s self-imposed shutdown in the early months of the pandemic led to millions of people losing their jobs in April 2020 as the unemployment rate shot up to 14.8%.
By the following January, the nation’s labor market had significantly improved with millions of Americans regaining employment – though the US still had a long way to go to recover all the jobs that were lost. The unemployment rate had fallen to 6.4%.

Pritzker’s misleading claim about Trump’s Covid-19 comments
On the second night of the Democratic National Convention, on Tuesday, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker repeated a claim a Democratic congressman had made the previous night about something former President Donald Trump said about the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
After touting Illinois’ handling of the pandemic, Pritzker then said of Trump: “And Donald? Well, Donald told us to inject bleach.”
Facts First: Pritzker’s claim is misleading. Trump never portrayed his ill-informed 2020 musings about the possibility of using disinfectant to treat Covid-19 as actual advice to Americans. Rather, Trump was talking about the possibility of scientists testing the possibility of using disinfectant as a treatment.
During a press briefing in April 2020, Trump expressed interest in scientists exploring the possibility of whether Covid-19 could be treated using disinfectants inside people’s bodies, “by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” or by deploying powerful light “inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.” Trump’s comments were slammed by medical experts as highly dangerous, and they prompted urgent warnings from public health authorities and companies that sell household disinfectants. But he never actually said he was suggesting citizens go and use such products.
Trump made the ill-informed remarks after Bill Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, outlined tests in which he said sunlight or disinfectants like bleach and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces and in saliva.
When Trump jumped shortly afterward to the dangerous idea of injecting disinfectants inside people’s bodies, he was talking about experts somehow testing that idea. He said: “And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So we’ll see.”

Sanders on the impact of expanded child tax credit
When touting the accomplishments of the President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders﻿ made a claim about the impact of the expanded child tax credit passed early in their administration.

“We cut childhood poverty by over 40% through an expanded child tax credit,” Sanders said during his primetime remarks at the Democratic National Convention.
Facts First: Sanders’ claim needs context. It’s true that the expanded child tax credit slashed the child poverty rate in 2021, but the benefit only lasted for the one year the temporary enhancement was in effect.
The American Rescue Plan Act, which Democrats pushed through Congress in March 2021, increased the size of the child tax credit to up to $3,600 – from $2,000 – for eligible families, enabled many more low-income parents to claim it and distributed half of it on a monthly basis.
That helped send child poverty – as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure – to a record low 5.2% in 2021, a drop of 46% from 2020, when the rate was 9.7% according to the US Census Bureau.
But in 2022, child poverty soared to 12.4%, roughly comparable to where it was prior to the pandemic in 2019. It was the largest jump in child poverty since the Supplemental Poverty Measure began.

 — 
Democratic state and federal officeholders, including President Joe Biden, delivered some false, misleading or lacking-key-context claims on the first night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday.
Biden repeated misleading claims he has made in previous speeches about billionaires’ tax rates and foreign trade. He also overstated the extent to which his efforts to fight climate change are expected to reduce US carbon emissions in the next decade. He made an outdated claim about the number of Americans with health insurance. And he omitted key context about his administration’s infrastructure-building efforts, framing distant goals as if they were already achievements.
Speaking earlier in the night, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois denounced former President Donald Trump for having presided over a loss of jobs without mentioning the critical context that the losses occurred because of the Covid-19 pandemic that caused a global economic crash. A video played at the convention similarly left out important context on the respective job-related records of the Trump and Biden-Harris administrations.
Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow falsely claimed that the Supreme Court has made Trump “completely immune from prosecution,” significantly overstating the court’s recent ruling.
And Rep. Robert Garcia of California misleadingly described Trump’s widely criticized 2020 comments about the possibility of scientists studying the use of injected disinfectant as a Covid-19 treatment, wrongly saying Trump had instructed Americans to inject bleach.
Here is a CNN fact check of these claims and some other remarks made on Monday.
Biden on taxing billionaires

During his speech, Biden asked the audience if they knew what the average billionaire in the United States pays in taxes.
“We have a thousand billionaires in America. You know what the average tax rate they pay? 8.2%,” Biden said.
Facts First: Biden used this figure in a way that was misleading. As in previous remarks, including his State of the Union address in March, Biden didn’t explain that the figure is the product of an alternative calculation, from economists in his own administration, that factors in unrealized capital gains that are not treated as taxable income under federal law.
There’s nothing inherently wrong with the alternative calculation itself; the administration economists who came up with it explained it in detail on the White House website in 2021. Biden, however, has tended to cite the figure without any context about what it is and isn’t, leaving open the impression that he was talking about what these billionaires pay under current law.
So, what do billionaires actually pay under current law? The answer is not publicly known, but experts say it’s clearly more than 8%.
“Biden’s numbers are way too low,” Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute think tank, told CNN in 2023. Gleckman said that in 2019, University of California, Berkeley, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman “estimated the top 400 households paid an average effective tax rate of about 23% in 2018. They got a lot of attention at the time because that rate was lower than the average rate of 24% for the bottom half of the income distribution. But it still was way more than 2 or 3,” numbers Biden has used in some previous speeches, “or even 8%.”
In February 2024, Gleckman provided additional calculations from the Tax Policy Center. The center found that the top 0.1% of households paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 30.3% in 2020, including an average income tax rate of 24.3%.

Biden on carbon emissions
Speaking about his achievements on climate, Biden said his agenda made possible “cutting carbon emissions in half by 2030.”
Facts First: Independent analysis shows the US is off-track to meet an ambitious goal Biden set early in his administration of slashing US carbon emissions in half by 2030 – even with his climate law.
Biden’s climate target of cutting emissions 50-52% below 2005 levels (2005 was the historical peak for US carbon emissions) by 2030 was always going to be a tough goal to achieve. When the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, analysis suggested it would get the US most of the way toward its goal – about a 40% reduction in carbon emissions. The thinking was that regulations from agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency would help make up the rest of the goal.
But a recent analysis from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group found that the US isn’t on track to hit Biden’s goal of slashing US emissions in half by 2030. Rhodium estimates the US is currently on track to reduce emissions anywhere from 32-43% by that date. However, the report says the US could surpass Biden’s goal by 2035 if there are no major changes to current policies, finding that the US would likely pick up the pace of decarbonizing its transportation, power and heavy industry sectors in the 2030s compared to the 2020s.
One big impediment to Biden’s goal is the fact that the EPA’s marquee climate rules regulating emissions from vehicles and power plants are facing an onslaught of legal challenges and a skeptical US Supreme Court. And an even bigger question mark is the 2024 election and whether Biden will be replaced by another Democrat with similar climate ambitions or former President Donald Trump – who has vowed to reverse much of Biden’s climate agenda.

Biden’s claim about removing lead pipes from schools and homes
Biden, speaking about his bipartisan infrastructure law, said: “We’re removing every lead pipe from schools and homes, so every child can drink clean water.”
Facts First: This claim needs context. While the administration is spending $15 billion and working on federal regulations to remove all lead pipes from public drinking water systems over a decade, they may not be able to replace all pipes and service lines on private properties.
Lead drinking pipes can be found all over the country; some national estimates say the total number of lead service lines is around 9.2 million. Lead in drinking water is a major health concern for babies and young children, and Biden has made eradicating it a major priority. The Biden EPA proposed a major rule that, if finalized, would compel water utilities to gradually get rid of 100% of their lead pipes and service lines over 10 years.
The EPA estimates this effort will cost utilities $20 billion to $30 billion over that decade; $15 billion of that could be covered by the bipartisan infrastructure law, and there is an additional $11.7 billion available through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund that could be used for lead removal as well. Cities with lead pipes, including New Orleans, are currently trying to locate all of their lead pipes.
The EPA’s rule as currently proposed does cover lead pipes and service lines on private property in addition to public, but replacing these smaller pipes on private property that go into homes could present a complex and costly challenge. Though the Biden initiative will make a major dent in replacing the country’s lead pipes, it could be difficult to be able to replace every single one on both private and public property.

Biden’s claim about trade ignores widening deficit under his presidency
President Joe Biden speaks at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago Monday. Rebecca Wright/CNN
In his speech, Biden said, “We used to import products and export jobs. Now we export American products and create American jobs right here in America.”
Fact First: This claim is misleading. So far this year, the United States has imported more goods than it has exported, leading to a seasonally adjusted trade deficit of more than $567 billion, according to figures from the US Census Bureau. 
In fact, the goods trade deficit has widened since Biden took office. In 2020, the nation’s goods trade deficit was $901 billion. After Biden’s first year in office, it increased to over $1 trillion and has stayed above that threshold every subsequent year.
The dollar’s strength has played a role in widening the goods trade deficit, making it more expensive for other countries to buy US-produced goods, and at the same time, cheaper for Americans to buy goods abroad.

Biden on building electric vehicle charging stations
Speaking about his administration’s goal to create more clean energy jobs, Biden said IBEW workers were at work “installing 500,000 charging stations all across America” to power electric vehicles.
Facts First: This is more of a promise than a fact, but even so, it needs context. For a few reasons, it’s questionable whether the Biden administration will be able to meet its goal of installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations on US roads.
Installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations has long been one of Biden’s goals. The president initially proposed Congress spend $15 billion to make it a reality, but just half of that – $7.5 billion – passed as part of the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The latest data from the Department of Energy shows the United States is still a long way from that goal; there are currently more than 180,000 EV charging ports operating at over 66,000 station locations around the US.
Though the administration has said that could be backfilled by private investment, that change in funding could hinder the administration’s ability to meet the goal. The federal government has spent the last few years sending money to states; states can now unlock more than $900 million in funding for fiscal years 2022 and 2023, which the administration estimated will “help build” chargers across approximately 53,000 miles of US highways.
Over the next five years, the full $5 billion will be spent to build out a network of EV chargers on major highways. Another pot of $2.5 billion in grant funding is also available for states to apply to; in January, $623 million in grant funding went out the door to help counties, cities and tribes around the nation install new charging stations for electric vehicles and long-haul freight trucks.
But it’s been slow going. States are still in the process of selecting companies to actually build the charging stations, meaning it could still take months or even years to fully see the impact of the money around the nation.
There is also a wide range in how much different types of chargers cost, and individual states have a lot of leeway in deciding what kinds of chargers will go on their roads. DC fast chargers can charge a car to mostly full in 20 minutes to an hour and are meant to go on major highways and roads. Another kind of charger known as an L2 charger can take hours to charge a car to full. But DC fast chargers are much more expensive, costing around $100,000 compared to around $6,000 for an L2, Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, a senior resident fellow at the think tank Third Way, has told CNN.

Biden on number of people with health insurance
Biden touted his achievements in expanding health insurance coverage to more Americans.
“More Americans have health insurance today than ever before in American history,” he said at the Democratic National Convention.
Facts First: Biden’s claim is outdated. While it’s true that health insurance coverage hit a record high last year, fewer people were insured in the first quarter of this year than in the spring of last year – in large part because a federal law that prevented states from winnowing their Medicaid rolls lapsed last year.
Some 130 million Americans had public health insurance coverage, such as Medicare or Medicaid, in the first quarter of this year, but that’s down from nearly 138 million people in the second quarter of last year, according to the latest National Health Interview Survey. The loss outpaces the gain of just under 3 million people in private health insurance plans. (A small number of people have both types of coverage.)
At the same time, the number of uninsured Americans rose to 27.1 million in the first quarter of this year, up from 23.7 million people in the spring of 2023. That pushed the uninsured rate up to 8.2%, from 7.2%, over that time period.
One main reason why health insurance coverage hit a record high last year was because of a Covid-19 pandemic relief provision that barred states from involuntarily disenrolling residents whom they deemed no longer qualify in exchange for enhanced federal funding. That prohibition was lifted in April 2023.
Only 81.7 million people were enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program this past April, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That compares to 93.9 million people in March 2023, before the provision lapsed.

Biden claims Trump will do “everything to ban abortion nationwide”
Biden said Monday that “Trump will do everything to ban abortion nationwide. Oh, he will.”
Facts First: Biden is making a prediction that we cannot definitively fact check, but the claim does not reflect Trump’s most recent comments on abortion and needs context.
While Trump regularly boasts that he played a key role in getting the US Supreme Court to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed abortion rights across the country, Trump says it should be up to the states to decide how and when to restrict abortion. Polls show that the majority of Americans are against a federal abortion ban.
Throughout this most recent campaign, Donald Trump has repeatedly ducked direct questions about his support for a federal ban on abortions, but he said in April that he would not sign a national abortion ban if elected to the White House again. That statement reversed what he said in 2016 when he was first running for the presidency and was the opposite of statements he made throughout his time in office.
Some scholars are concerned that conservative advisers to Trump have encouraged him to ban abortions by enforcing the 1873 Comstock Act, a method that could essentially create a federal ban without Trump needing to sign any legislation to do it.
The Victorian-era anti-vice law that is still on the books is not currently enforced. The law bans the mailing of “obscene” materials used to produce an abortion. Some scholars believe Trump could use the Justice Department to enforce a ban that would not just restrict people from sending the medication currently used in the majority of abortions through the mail, but would ban any kind of materials used to produce any kind of abortion.
Trump has not officially endorsed the enforcement of the Comstock Act, but it is a strategy some of his advisers have outlined as an option for Trump to restrict abortions nationwide.

California congressman’s misleading claim about Trump’s comments about Covid-19 and disinfectant
Garcia claimed, among other things, that Trump “told us to inject bleach into our bodies,” while criticizing Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis.
Facts First: Garcia’s claim is misleading. Trump never portrayed his ill-informed 2020 musings about the possibility of using disinfectant to treat Covid-19 as actual advice to Americans. Rather, Trump was talking about the possibility of scientists testing the possibility of using disinfectant as a treatment.
During a press briefing in April 2020, Trump expressed interest in scientists exploring the possibility of whether Covid-19 could be treated using disinfectants inside people’s bodies, “by injection inside or almost a cleaning,” or by deploying powerful light “inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way.” Trump’s comments were slammed by medical experts as highly dangerous, and they prompted urgent warnings from public health authorities and companies that sell household disinfectants. But he never actually said he was suggesting citizens go and use such products.
Trump made the ill-informed remarks after Bill Bryan, the acting undersecretary of science and technology for the Department of Homeland Security, outlined tests in which he said sunlight or disinfectants like bleach and isopropyl alcohol quickly killed the coronavirus on surfaces and in saliva.
When Trump jumped shortly afterward to the dangerous idea of injecting disinfectants inside people’s bodies, he was talking about experts somehow testing that idea. He said: “And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So we’ll see.”

Durbin’s missing context on Trump’s jobs record
Durbin of Illinois, the Senate Majority Whip, claimed of Trump: “He lost millions of jobs in America.” Durbin said shortly after that, “He is one of only two presidents in the history of the United States to leave office with fewer Americans working than when he started.”
Facts First: Durbin’s statistics are correct, but he left out some critical context about them. While there was a net loss of about 2.7 million jobs from the beginning of Trump’s four-year term to the end, there was a net gain of about 6.7 million jobs under Trump until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country about three years into his term.  
Nearly 22 million jobs were lost under Trump in March 2020 and April 2020 when the global economy cratered on account of the pandemic. The US then started regaining jobs immediately, adding more than 12 million from May 2020 through December 2020, but not enough to make up for the massive early-pandemic losses.

Beatty’s claim about the Biden administration’s expansion of the child tax credit
Rep. Joyce Beatty speaks during the 2024 Democratic National Convention at the United Center in Chicago Monday. Rebecca Wright/CNN
Ohio Rep. Joyce Beatty praised the Biden administration’s efforts to provide larger tax credits for families and lift more children out of poverty.
“Joe and Kamala have been expanding the child tax credit, and let me just tell you … cutting the poverty rate for our children,” she said.
Facts First: Beatty’s claim needs context. It’s true that the expanded child tax credit passed early in the Biden administration slashed the child poverty rate in 2021, but the benefit only lasted for the one year the temporary enhancement was in effect. Child poverty increased in 2022 to a rate roughly comparable to where it was in 2019.
The American Rescue Plan Act, which Democrats pushed through Congress in March 2021, increased the size of the child tax credit to up to $3,600 – from $2,000 – for eligible families, enabled many more low-income parents to claim it and distributed half of it on a monthly basis.
That helped send child poverty – as measured by the Supplemental Poverty Measure – to a record low 5.2% in 2021, a drop of 46% from 2020, when the rate was 9.7% according to the US Census Bureau. The child tax credit lifted 2.9 million children out of poverty in 2021, with the temporary enhancement accounting for 2.1 million of those kids, according to the Census Bureau.
The Supplemental Poverty Measure, which began in 2009, takes into account certain non-cash government assistance, tax credits and needed expenses.
But in 2022, child poverty soared to 12.4%, roughly comparable to where it was prior to the pandemic in 2019. It was the largest jump in child poverty since the Supplemental Poverty Measure began.
Earlier this year, the House passed a tax bill that would again expand the child tax credit temporarily, though the boost would not be as generous as it was in 2021. Senate Republicans blocked it from advancing in their chamber earlier this month.

Harris campaign video showcasing Trump’s ‘lies’ on the economy misses context
In a prerecorded video from Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign team, a staffer shared claims Trump has made about the economy seeking to disprove them.
“Let’s take a look at his track record on jobs before Covid, as compared to the Biden-Harris administration. What do you know? Hardly the most successful ever,” the staffer said as a screen displayed average monthly job gains under Trump from January 2017 to February 2020 compared to average monthly gains during the entire Biden-Harris administration.
“And about his supposed manufacturing miracle, Trump talked a big game, but actually lost 178,000 manufacturing jobs. And just to be clear, it wasn’t just Covid here either. Manufacturing jobs were already on their way down before the pandemic.”
Facts First: The numbers the campaign staffer shared are correct, but they lack crucial context. It’s unfair to compare the average monthly job gains Trump achieved up until March 2020 to that of the Biden-Harris administration. That’s because the average monthly gains achieved under their administration were propped up by some of the gangbuster job reports that came just as the economy was recovering from the pandemic. For instance, in July 2021, 939,000 jobs were added in just one month.
And while it’s true 178,000 manufacturing jobs were lost when Trump was president, Covid-19 did in fact play a big role. In the immediate months before the pandemic, manufacturing jobs were declining very slightly. From November 2019 to February 2020, 36,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. That hardly compares to the roughly 1.4 million manufacturing jobs lost from February 2020 to April 2020. That so many of those job losses were able to be recouped by the time Trump left office is noteworthy.

Rodriguez’s claim on Trump wanting to terminate the Affordable Care Act
Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez on Monday accused Trump of still wanting to kill the Affordable Care Act.
“Now, Trump is promising to terminate the Affordable Care Act,” Rodriguez said at the DNC.
Facts First: Rodriguez’s claim does not reflect Trump’s recent comments on the Affordable Care Act. He did appear to express renewed support for terminating the law in one social media post late last year, but he has since said he wants to improve it, not terminate it.  Most recently, he has said he will keep the law unless he can come up with an unspecified “better” plan.
Repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act was one of Trump’s top priorities in his 2016 presidential campaign and first term. However, even though Republicans controlled Congress and the White House the following year, they failed to unite behind a plan to do so, ending any serious attempts to completely overhaul the landmark health reform law, popularly known as Obamacare.
The former president revived the debate over the law’s fate in November 2023, when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he’s “seriously looking at alternatives” and that the failure to terminate it “was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!”
Trump quickly walked back his comments, posting a few days later that he doesn’t “want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!”
In April, Trump said in a video posted to Truth Social: “I’m not running to terminate the ACA as crooked Joe Biden says all over the place. We’re going to make the ACA much better than it is right now and much less expensive for you.”
And at a North Carolina rally last week, he said: “(Vice President Kamala Harris) goes around saying, ‘Oh, he’s going to get rid of the health.’ No, no, I’m going to keep it unless we can come up with something that’s better for you and less expensive for you. Otherwise, we’re not doing it.”
However, Trump has yet to release a proposal on how he would make the Affordable Care Act better and less expensive.

Michigan state senator makes false claim about Trump immunity
During a speech at the DNC about Project 2025, McMorrow said that the conservative blueprint for a second Trump term aimed to greatly expand the power of the presidency “like no president has ever had or should ever have.”
The Democratic lawmaker went on to say that if anyone wondered if those potential new powers were legal, “Thanks to Donald Trump’s hand-picked Supreme Court, he’s now completely immune from prosecution – even if he breaks the law.”
Facts First: McMorrow’s comment about the case Trump v. US is false. In their decision last month in the historic case, the six conservative justices granted Trump some immunity from prosecution, but not blanket immunity, as the former president had sought. The court said Trump could not be criminally pursued over “official acts,” but that he could face prosecution over alleged criminal actions involving “unofficial acts” taken while in office. 
“The President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative majority.
And while Trump appointed three of the justices who helped make up the six-justice majority, the other three, including Roberts, were appointed by previous Republican presidents.
The federal judge in Washington, DC, overseeing special counsel Jack Smith’s election subversion case against Trump must now examine the allegations against the former president to determine which ones are covered by the newly granted immunity.

DNC video leaves out context about Trump abortion comment from 2016
A video about abortion rights that was played at the DNC on Monday featured a short clip of former Trump agreeing, in a television interview, that women who get abortions should be punished.
Facts First: The video left out some important context: Trump made this comment more than eight years ago and retracted it hours after he made it. In an interview in April 2024, Trump declined to express an opinion on the idea of a state deciding to punish women for getting an abortion after it is banned, returning to his campaign refrain that abortion policy is now a matter for each state to decide.
Trump made the comment featured in the DNC video at an MSNBC town hall during the Republican presidential primary in 2016. Trump said that “there has to be some form of punishment” for abortion. When host Chris Matthews asked, “For the woman?” Trump responded, “Yeah, there has to be some form.” When Matthews pressed further, Trump said he didn’t know what the punishment should be.
Hours later, after facing widespread criticism, Trump issued a statement in which he said women should not be punished for getting abortions.
“If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the woman,” Trump said in the statement. “The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed – like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions.”
The next day on Fox News, Trump said, “It could be that I misspoke” during an abortion discussion he claimed was “convoluted.” He said that “if, in fact, abortion was outlawed, the person performing the abortion, the doctor, or whoever it may be that’s really doing the act is responsible for the act, not the woman, is responsible.”
In an April 2024 interview, Time magazine asked Trump if he is “comfortable if states decide to punish women who access abortions after the procedure is banned,” such as after a 15-week cutoff date. Trump said, “Again, that’s going to be – I don’t have to be comfortable or uncomfortable. The states are going to make that decision. The states are going to have to be comfortable or uncomfortable, not me.”

61,Fact Check,2024,8,"Fact check: Debunking Trump attack on Walz, Minnesota schools say they don’t provide tampons in boys’ bathrooms",Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
A variety of Minnesota public school districts say they do not provide tampons in boys’ bathrooms — debunking a claim former President Donald Trump has been making about Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate.
Trump has asserted that Walz signed a law that forces Minnesota schools to provide free tampons in boys’ bathrooms, suggesting this supposed policy is evidence of Walz’s radicalism on gender issues.
Trump said at an August 9 campaign rally in Montana: “He ordered tampons to be put into boys’ bathrooms. Do we have any children here? Please close your ears. He ordered tampons in boys’ bathrooms.” Trump said at his Thursday press conference: “He signed a bill that boys’ bathrooms — all boys’ bathrooms in Minnesota — will have tampons.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are false.
Walz didn’t order Minnesota schools to put tampons in boys’ bathrooms or sign a bill requiring tampons to be put in all boys’ bathrooms. That’s not what the bill signed by Walz in 2023 actually says — and it’s not how the 15 Minnesota school districts that spoke to CNN on Friday say they have implemented the law.
The law, intended to make sure students of all income levels and gender identities have ready access to menstrual products, says school districts and charter schools must make menstrual products like tampons and pads available at no cost “to all menstruating students in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12 according to a plan developed by the school district.”
The law never specifies that the menstrual products must be put in “boys’ bathrooms,” and it allows school districts to decide what counts as a bathroom “regularly used by students.” Districts are permitted to provide menstrual products in bathrooms for students of any gender, which are often single-stall rooms, rather than in their traditional multi-stall bathrooms for boys.
All 15 of the districts that responded Friday to a CNN survey of 25 districts, including the Minneapolis and St. Paul districts in the state’s two most populous cities, said they comply with the law without providing tampons in traditional boys’ bathrooms.
Kevin Burns, a spokesperson for Mankato Area Public Schools, the district where Walz was a high school teacher before entering politics, told CNN that schools there are satisfying “the letter and intent of the statute,” which Burns called “very clear,” by providing menstrual products in “traditional female and gender-neutral restrooms” as well as school nurses’ offices, not boys’ bathrooms.
“St. Cloud Area Schools provides free period products in female-only restrooms, designated gender-neutral restrooms, and from school health-care offices. Period products are not provided in male-only designated restrooms,” said Tami DeLand, a spokesperson for that district in central Minnesota.
“We have provided free tampons and pads to all in ‘nongendered’ student restrooms and girls’ restrooms for grades 4 and up. They are also available from health staffers. We do not have menstrual products in boys’ bathrooms,” said Toya Stewart Downey, a spokesperson for the Robbinsdale district in the suburbs of Minneapolis.
“The Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan Public Schools provides menstrual products in girls’ bathrooms and gender-neutral bathrooms, not boys’ bathrooms,” said Tony Taschner, a spokesperson for the Twin Cities-area suburban district. “If we are aware of transgender students who need menstrual products and use the boys’ bathrooms, school staff would work with these students individually on a case-by-case basis.”
Scott Croonquist, executive director of Minnesota’s Association of Metropolitan School Districts, which says its 52 member districts educate more than half of public school students in the state, said Friday: “Our interpretation of the law is the same as what you have heard from the people you have talked to in school districts. The law does NOT require menstrual products in boys’ bathrooms.”
School districts comply without providing tampons in boys’ bathrooms
It’s certainly possible that some Minnesota schools do provide tampons in traditional multi-stall boys’ bathrooms; the state has more than 300 school districts in all, and CNN communicated with a small fraction of them this week. But Trump’s claim is that Walz signed a law that requires all Minnesota schools to provide tampons in their boys’ bathrooms — and that’s clearly wrong.
Jim Skelly, spokesperson for the large Anoka-Hennepin school district, said, “menstrual products are not provided in male-gendered bathrooms in our school district.” Instead, he said, its schools provide the products “in alignment with the state law in single-stall, all-gender bathrooms and in female-gendered bathrooms at the middle school and high school level. These products are also available from health professionals in the building at all levels.”
“Just as with Anoka-Hennepin, the free products are not found in traditional male-only bathrooms in Osseo Area Schools,” said a spokesperson for the Osseo Area district near Minneapolis, Clay Sawatzke, said on Friday. “But they are provided free to all in girls’ bathrooms and in single stall/universal bathrooms.”
“Rochester Public Schools is fully compliant with MN Statute 121A.212. Free menstrual products are provided in our gender neutral and girls’ bathrooms, or available from health staff,” said a spokesperson for that district in the state’s third-most-populous city.
“Minneapolis Public Schools purchased and installed menstrual product dispensers in all assigned female bathrooms and near all gender-neutral bathrooms,” said district spokesperson Donnie Belcher.
“Free menstrual products are available in girls’ bathrooms, non-gendered bathrooms and in school health offices,” said Amy Parnell, spokesperson for the Wayzata Public Schools suburban district near Minneapolis.
St. Paul Public Schools spokesperson Erica Wacker said, “Locations for dispensers and receptacles for pads and tampons include non-gendered single stall toilets, such as in main offices; toilets in the health offices; group toilets for girls; and one-third of the individual toilet rooms in buildings that have inclusive restrooms.”

 — 
Former President Donald Trump held a news conference on Thursday in which he continued to be highly dishonest – again making more than 20 false claims, as he also did in his Monday conversation with Elon Musk.
Many of Trump’s inaccurate Thursday claims have been debunked for years. But some of them were relatively new. At one point, he claimed that his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, was responsible for a California policy he claimed allows people to rob stores.
“They had a recent article, and I didn’t know this, but you’re allowed to rob a store as long as it’s not more than $950. Has everyone ever heard of that? You can rob a store, and you have these thieves going into stores with calculators calculating how much it is. Because if it’s less than $950 they can rob it and not get charged. That was her that did that,” Trump said.
Facts First: This claim is false in two significant ways.
First, theft under $950 remains illegal in California; it is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail. It’s certainly true that some misdemeanor cases are never prosecuted, but Trump at the very least left open the impression that the state – and Harris herself – made theft under $950 legal.
Second, Harris was not the person who “did that.” In 2010, the Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, signed a law that increased the dollar threshold to trigger felony grand theft charges from the previous level of $400 to a new level of $950. Then, in 2014, California voters affirmed that $950 threshold (and created a new crime of shoplifting) as part of a referendum, approved with nearly 60% support, that reduced penalties for a variety of non-violent offenses.
Harris did not take a public position on the referendum, deciding to stay neutral in her role as state attorney general.
Some critics of Harris and the ballot proposal, known as Proposition 47, have argued that she implicitly supported the proposal by having her office write a favorable ballot summary for the proposal. Regardless, that’s a long way from Trump’s claim.
Here is a fact check of some other false claims Trump made Thursday.
Walz and bathrooms: Trump claimed that Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, “signed a bill that boys’ bathrooms – all boys’ bathrooms in Minnesota – will have tampons.” But as PolitiFact has reported, the bill Walz signed in 2023 does not say “all boys’ bathrooms” will have tampons.
Rather, the bill requires that tampons be provided to “all menstruating students” in fourth grade through 12th grade in bathrooms students regularly use – and leaves it up to school districts to decide how to comply. Districts can, for example, provide tampons to transgender boys by placing the items in unisex bathrooms. A spokesperson for the state’s largest school district told Minneapolis’ Star Tribune newspaper earlier this month that it does not provide tampons in boys’ bathrooms, instead providing them in “nongendered bathrooms,” girls’ bathrooms and via health staff.
The Supreme Court’s immunity decision: Trump claimed, “As you know, the Supreme Court ruled recently on immunity, and I’m immune from all of the stuff that they charged me with.”
Wrong. The Supreme Court did not give Trump blanket immunity against “all” of the charges he is facing, even in his federal election subversion case in particular; the court ruled that he has immunity for “official acts” taken during his presidency but that “the President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official.” Trump’s own lawyer conceded to the court that some of the acts at issue in the case were not official.
The case has now been sent back to a federal district court judge to figure out how the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling applies to the specific allegations against Trump.
“Lock her up” chants: Trump, complaining that Democrats want to put him in prison, falsely claimed he discouraged his supporters’ “lock her up” chants about Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election campaign, asserting that he would respond, “Easy, just easy.” In fact, Trump sometimes said “lock her up” himself, sometimes called for Clinton’s imprisonment using different language and many other times paused his speeches and stood in silence to allow the chants to continue.
US energy: Trump claimed “we don’t have energy.” That’s wrong even if he is solely referring to fossil fuel production. The US is producing more crude oil than any country ever has.
Mortgage rates: Trump claimed mortgage rates are “now at 10%.” The standard, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.49% in the week that ended on August 15, mortgage financing giant Freddie Mac said Thursday.
Inflation under Trump: Trump claimed he handed Harris and President Joe Biden an economy “with no inflation.” That’s also not true. Inflation was about 1.4% in the month Trump left office, which is low but not nonexistent, and cumulative inflation under Trump was about 8%.
His civil fraud case: Trump repeated a false claim about his civil fraud trial, claiming he “won the case” at an appeals court but a lower court judge still required him to pay a large fine. He did not win the case at the appeals court.
Harris’ immigration role: Trump claimed that Harris has been “border czar” during her vice presidency. In reality, Harris was given a more limited immigration-related assignment, leading diplomacy with Central American countries in an attempt to address the “root causes” of their citizens’ migration; Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been in charge of border security during the Biden administration.
Awareness of Harris: Arguing that Harris’ support will decline when Americans get to know her better, Trump repeated a previous claim that “nobody” even knows her last name is Harris. This is obvious nonsense.
The 2020 presidential election: Trump claimed that he received 10 to 12 million more votes in the 2020 election he lost than he did in the 2016 election he won, which is accurate (it was about 11.2 million more votes) - but then added, “And that’s not including other votes, that we can talk about it another day.” There is no pool of legitimate “other votes” that were not included in Trump’s total.
Foreign governments and immigration: Trump repeated his regular baseless claim that foreign countries are deliberately “bringing” criminals and people “from mental institutions and insane asylums” to the US as migrants, even “driving them through” the border. Trump’s own campaign hasn’t been able to substantiate these claims, and experts say they have found no evidence for them.
China, Iran and Hamas: Trump repeated a regular claim that during his presidency, “Hamas had no money because Iran had no money,” suggesting this was because he successfully pressured China and others to stop buying oil from Iran. In fact, Iran’s funding for Hamas and other terror groups never stopped during his presidency, though it did decline, and China never stopped buying oil from Iran, though its purchases did decline before rebounding later in his presidency.
Nord Stream 2: Trump falsely claimed, “I ended Nord Stream 2. The pipeline was dead.” He didn’t kill the pipeline. He signed sanctions related to the project into law about three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already about 90% complete, and the state-owned Russian company behind the project announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming.
Military equipment and Afghanistan: Trump repeated his familiar wild exaggeration that the US left $85 billion in military equipment to the Taliban upon the Biden-era withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Defense Department has estimated that this equipment was valued at about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.
Money from Russia: Trump repeated his baseless claim that Biden received $3.5 million from the wife of a former mayor of Moscow. This money was sent to a firm connected to Biden’s son Hunter Biden, whose former business partner has testified that it was meant for him and not Hunter Biden; regardless, it didn’t go to Joe Biden.
Chris Wallace and this money from Russia: Trump repeated his false claim that journalist Chris Wallace, now of CNN and formerly of Fox News, tried to stop him from talking about this money from Russia during a presidential debate Wallace moderated in 2020, saying, “You shouldn’t be talking about that.” Wallace never said that; as the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer a question about the money, not to stop Trump from asking the question.
Tariffs on China: Trump claimed he took in “hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs from China” and that no previous president had taken in “10 cents” from tariffs on China. Both claims are wrong. Study after study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs, and the US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office.
Trump’s trade deal with China: Trump claimed that, during his presidency, China was “adhering to” the terms of a trade deal he made, in which China was supposed to buy tens of billions worth of additional US exports. China did not come close to living up to its purchase commitments.
Deportations to Central America under Obama: Trump repeated his usual inaccurate story about how the Obama administration supposedly couldn’t deport violent criminals to Central American countries; he didn’t name the countries this time, but told the same story on Monday about Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. In 2016, Obama’s last calendar year in office, none of these three countries were on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant” (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/fact-check-trump-bedminster-news-conference/index.html
63,Fact Check,2024,8,Fact check: Trump falsely accuses Harris and Biden of lying about $35 insulin,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump delivered a Wednesday speech that was laden with false claims he has made before. One of them was about insulin prices for seniors.
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, claimed in the North Carolina address that Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent in the presidential election, and President Joe Biden are lying when they tout their success in bringing insulin prices for Medicare recipients down to $35 per month (per prescription). Trump claimed that they are taking credit for his own work.
Trump said: “Kamala and Joe tried to take credit for $35 insulin. You know that? You know who did that? I did that. I did that. I did the insulin, and it kicked in. And you know, I remember when I did it – it had to be a statute, it was a certain statute that took a certain period of time – I said, ‘I hope I’m elected because somebody’s going to get a lot of credit for doing what I got done.’ I got it done, $35 insulin. And now they take credit for it. It’s terrible. Terrible.” He complained that they had not thanked him for his work, then said, “Instead, they say, ‘We brought insulin in at $35.’ It’s a lie.”
Facts First: Trump’s narrative is false. He did create a $35-per-month cap on insulin for some people on Medicare, through a voluntary program that prescription drug plans could choose to participate in, but did not sign a statute (a law) to secure the future of the program. Biden and Harris did get a statute passed – and that law created a permanent $35-per-month Medicare insulin policy that went far beyond Trump’s. The law ensured that all 3.4 million-plus insulin users on Medicare, not just some of them, got $35-per-month insulin. It did so through a mandatory cap that not only covers more people than Trump’s voluntary cap did but also applies to a greater number of insulin products than Trump’s did and stays in effect at a level of individual drug spending at which Trump’s cap disappeared.
Trump could fairly say he played a role in lowering insulin costs and that Biden and Harris do not deserve sole credit. The Biden-era federal government has acknowledged that Biden’s mandatory $35 monthly cap “closely aligns with” the voluntary $35 monthly cap in the Trump-created program that was announced in 2020 and launched in the final month of the Trump presidency in 2021.
But Trump’s attempt to create the impression that Biden and Harris are simply seizing credit for his policy is inaccurate. The Biden administration’s policy goes beyond Trump’s policy in multiple ways, in addition to the fact that it was enshrined by legislation.
The Biden policy applies the $35-per-month cap to every insulin user in Medicare Part D, while the Trump policy didn’t; the Biden policy applies the $35 cap to Medicare Part B, while the Trump policy was only for Medicare Part D; the Biden policy requires a $35 cap on all covered insulin products, while the Trump policy only required it on some; and the Biden policy eliminates insulin payments for patients at the “catastrophic” level of drug spending, while the $35 cap didn’t exist at the “catastrophic” level under the Trump policy.

Other false claims
Trump made a variety of other false claims in the Wednesday speech. Here is a brief fact check of 13 of those claims, many of which have been previously debunked. (This is not a complete list.)
- He claimed that the price of bacon “went up by four or five times” under Biden and Harris. It’s actually up 18%, nowhere near the 300% or 400% spike Trump is claiming.
- He claimed that Harris’ policy proposals will result in people’s taxes quadrupling. Experts say there is no basis for this claim.
- Speaking of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he claimed Biden is “letting him have the whole thing.” In fact, Biden has led an international effort to help Ukraine fight Russia; Russia has to date been able to seize about 18% of Ukraine’s territory, nowhere near the entire country.
- He said Covid-19 was “ending all over the world, it was pretty much ending” when Biden and Harris took office in January 2021. It was not.
- He said his tax cuts were the largest ever. They were not.
- He said he took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China through his tariffs on Chinese products, and that no previous president had taken in “10 cents” from tariffs on China. Both claims are wrong. Study after study has found that Americans paid the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs, and the US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office.
- He said Biden appointed Harris as “border czar” and put her in charge of the border. In reality, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has been in charge of border security under Biden; Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment, asking her to lead diplomacy with Central American countries in an attempt to address the “root causes” of their citizens’ migration.
- He said he built 571 miles of border wall. Official government statistics show it was 458 miles, most of it﻿ replacement barrier.
- He said he built more border wall “than I said I was going to build.” In fact, he repeatedly said during his 2016 campaign that “we need” 1,000 miles of wall, far more than he ended up building.
- He said he forced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential candidate, to deploy the National Guard during civil unrest in Minneapolis in 2020. In fact, Walz deployed the National Guard before Trump pressured him to do so.
- He said Venezuela is “taking all of their criminals” and people from mental institutions and “bringing” them to the US. Experts say there is no evidence for this claim.
- He said Houston has the only refinery in the world that can handle Venezuelan oil. Various other refineries in the US refine Venezuelan oil.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/14/politics/fact-check-insulin-trump-biden-harris/index.html
64,Fact Check,2024,8,Fact check: Trump made at least 20 false claims in his conversation with Elon Musk,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump delivered his usual bombardment of false claims – at least 20 in all – during a Monday conversation with billionaire supporter Elon Musk, which aired on Musk’s social media platform, X.
Most of the falsehoods uttered by the Republican presidential nominee were claims that have been repeatedly debunked before, some of them for years. They spanned a broad range of subjects, from immigration to the economy to foreign policy to Trump’s record in office to Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent.
Here is a fact check:
Crime 
Trump claimed, “Our crime rate’s going through the roof.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Both violent crime and property crime dropped significantly in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. 
There are limitations to the FBI-published data from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data and the submitted data usually has some errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But other data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent.
The preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% decline in murder and a roughly 6% decline in overall violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in Trump’s last calendar year in office in 2020. The preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall violent crime.
Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said earlier this year that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline “ever recorded.” And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also “crime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.”
After Trump claimed in June that “crime is so much up,” Anna Harvey, a political science professor and director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University, noted to CNN that the claim is contradicted both by the data from the FBI and from the Major Cities Chiefs Association, which represents 70 large US police forces. She said: “It would be more accurate to say that crime is so much down.”
Inflation
Trump said, “I think we have the worst inflation we’ve had in 100 years. They say it’s 48 years, I don’t believe it.”
Facts First: Trump framed this as an opinion, but it’s baseless nonetheless – wrong in two different ways. First, even when the inflation rate hit its Biden-era peak of 9.1% in June 2022, that 9.1% rate was the highest since 1981 – between 40 and 41 years prior, certainly not “100 years” and not even “48 years.” Second, inflation has declined sharply since the June 2022 peak, and the most recent available rate at the time he spoke, for July 2024, was 3.2% – a rate that, the Biden presidency aside, was exceeded as recently as 2011.
Global warming and sea levels
Trump argued that the threat of the nuclear war is far more important than the threat posed by climate change. And he said: “The biggest threat? It’s not global warming, where the ocean’s gonna rise one eighth of an inch over the next 400 years … and you’ll have more oceanfront property, right?”
Facts First: Trump’s claim about the pace of sea-level rise is wildly inaccurate. The global average sea level is currently rising more per year than Trump claimed that it will rise in 400 years. 
NASA reported in March that the current global average sea-level rise in 2023 was 0.17 inches per year, more than double the rate in 1993. And a World Meteorological Organization report this year said the rate of sea level rise between 2014 and 2023 was about 0.19 inches per year.
In other words, sea level rise is already more than an eighth of an inch annually – and it is accelerating. NASA found a jump of 0.3 inches between 2022 and 2023.
Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz professor of earth and planetary sciences who studies sea-level rise, said last year that Trump’s similar claims “can only be described as totally out of touch with reality” and that Trump “has no idea what he is talking about.”
Sea levels rise by different amounts in different locations. For the US, sea levels are expected to rise particularly fast for the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast – and Trump’s state of Florida, which is bordered by both of those coasts, is expected to be affected more severely than many other coastal states.
In fact, Trump’s claims about sea levels are highly inaccurate for the area near Mar-a-Lago, which is on the Atlantic. Griggs noted in a June email that data from the closest National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tide gauge to Mar-a-Lago shows an increase of an eighth of an inch roughly every nine months.
Trump has also previously made the joke about rising seas creating more oceanfront property. In reality, rising sea levels are expected to have devastating consequences not only for many seafront properties but for areas further inland – rendering some communities uninhabitable and others more dangerous, increasing the frequency and reach of flooding, making hurricanes more destructive and damaging infrastructure and ecosystems.
The number of people listening to the conversation
Trump told Musk that “you got a lot of people listening” to the conversation – “like 60 million or something.” He then asked somebody what the number was, but he never corrected his initial estimate.
Facts First: Trump did express uncertainty about the number, but his “like 60 million or something” claim is false. At the time he made this remark, public data on X showed that there were 1.1 million accounts listening to the conversation. 
Trump appeared to be referring to something different: the number of views on his own X post sharing the “space” where the conversation was played. But the vast majority of the accounts that viewed the post did not actually listen to the conversation.
Harris and prisoners
Trump claimed of Harris: “She wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention, and some of these guys are really bad. That just came out today.”
Facts First: This is false. There is no basis for the claim that Harris “wants to release all the prisoners that are in detention.” Trump appeared to be referring to news stories in conservative media that reported that Harris had said in 2019, while unsuccessfully running in the Democratic presidential primary, that she wanted to close privately-run immigration detention centers. 
Even if Harris continues to hold this position today – she has not addressed the subject since she began her presidential campaign in July – closing privately-run immigration detention centers would not result in the release of “all” prisoners in immigration detention, let alone all prisoners in regular US jails and prisons; Trump did not specify that he was talking about Harris’ past stance on certain immigration detention facilities rather than all prisons.
It’s possible Trump had been misled himself; a short clip shared by some Republicans on social media this week did not include the part of Harris’ 2019 remarks where she specified that she was referring to privately run immigration detention facilities in particular.
But articles by Fox News and The New York Post correctly noted that this was what she said.
Harris’ immigration role
Trump claimed of Harris: “She was the border czar, and people can’t allow them to get away with their disinformation campaign. Now, she’s saying she wasn’t really involved … she was totally in charge.”
Facts First: This is false. Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate, and was never “totally in charge” of the border; Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is the official in charge of border security. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.
Some Republicans have scoffed at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.
A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy.
Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.”
Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries (he also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.”
Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far.
Venezuela, crime and migration
Trump claimed: “Venezuela – their crime is down 72%. They’re taking their drug dealers.
They’re taking – frankly, their prisoners, they’re emptying out their prisons. They’re taking their criminals, their murderers, their rapists and they’re delivering them…”
Facts First: Trump greatly overstated the Biden-era decline in crime in Venezuela, at least according to the limited statistics that are publicly available. And while it is certain that at least some criminals have joined law-abiding Venezuelans in a mass exodus from the country amid the economic crisis of the last decade, there is no proof Venezuela has deliberately emptied prisons for migration purposes or intentionally sent ex-prisoners to the United States.
Right-wing website Breitbart published a vague 2022 article about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents about freed violent prisoners from Venezuela who had then joined migrant caravans. But this supposed claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated; experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no proof of any such thing having happened.
“We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June.
Venezuela’s government does not publish reliable official crime statistics, so it’s hard to get a complete picture. But Briceño-León’s group publishes annual data on violent deaths, which includes homicides, police killings and deaths still under investigation. It found a decline of roughly 26% in the number of violent deaths from 2021 to 2023.
That’s substantial, but not “72%.” Briceño-León noted in his email that you could find a decline of roughly 70% by 2023 if you compared 2018 to 2023 – but Trump was US president until early 2021.
And crime trends in any country always have a complex mix of causes; Venezuela is no exception. Briceño-León argued that while migration has been a factor in the decline, crime has dropped in large part because the economic crisis has reduced opportunities for crime.
“Bank robberies disappear because there is no money to rob; kidnappings decrease because there is no cash to pay the ransoms; robberies on public transportation stop because travelers have no money in their pockets and old cell phones [with] no value,” he said.
Migration numbers
While talking about illegal immigration, Trump claimed that, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, “you have millions of people coming in a month.”
Facts First: This is false. There has not been any month under the Biden-Harris administration where even close to “millions” of people entered the country illegally. In the peak month during this administration for what the government calls border “encounters,” December 2023, there were 370,890 encounters nationwide. Even if you factor in so-called “gotaways,” people who evaded the Border Patrol to sneak into the country, there is no basis for the claim that “millions” of people are entering in a single month.
The number of nationwide encounters was 205,019 in June, the last month for which data is currently available to the public.
Migration numbers, part two 
Trump said of migration under Biden and Harris: “I believe it’s over 20 million people came into our country, many coming from jails, from prisons, from mental institutions, or a bigger version of that is insane asylums.”
Facts First: Trump’s “20 million” figure is false, a major exaggeration. The total number of “encounters” nationwide from February 2021 through June 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was about 10 million – and an “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away. In addition, there is no basis for Trump’s claim that “many” of these migrants have come in from jails, prisons or mental health facilities.
Even if you added the estimated number of Biden-era “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans said in May was nearly two million, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in late June after Trump used those figures.
The “encounters” figures can’t be described as figures on people successfully entering the US. Some encounters involve people who are deemed inadmissible at legal ports and are refused permission to enter. Also, the same person can be “encountered” multiple times if they keep returning to the border to try again – which is what happened in many cases under Biden when the Title 42 rapid-expulsion authority invoked by Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic was in place into May 2023.
In 2023, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – the Breitbart article that has not been corroborated. Even if Venezuela in particular had indeed freed prisoners to allow people to try to migrate to the US, that would be insufficient proof for Trump’s claim that some substantial number of Biden-era migrants are from prisons.
Migration and ‘the Congo’
Trump repeated a claim he has made before about “the Congo” and migration, again without specifying whether he was referring to the Democratic Republic of Congo or the neighboring Republic of Congo.
He said: “From Africa, from the Congo they’re coming, from the Congo. And, 22 people came in from the Congo recently and they’re murderers. And they drop ‘em. They take ‘em out of jails – which is very expensive, you know, to maintain the jails – they don’t do too much maintaining, I can tell you. But they take ‘em out of jails, prisons. They take ‘em out, and they bring them to the United States.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is baseless. Experts on the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Republic of Congo, plus both pro-immigration and anti-immigration organizations in the US, told CNN in March, after Trump made a similar claim, that they had not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having brought ex-prisoners into the US. Trump’s presidential campaign and an allied super PAC did not respond to requests to provide any evidence. A CNN search of two media databases turned up no evidence. 
“Everything he is saying isn’t true,” Democratic Republic of Congo spokesperson Patrick Muyaya Katembwe told CNN in a text message in March. Asked specifically about Trump’s claims about Congolese prisons being emptied of violent criminals, he said, “Never ever, it’s not true.” And, he said, “we want him to stop” telling these stories, since “it’s very bad for the country.”
Serge Mombouli, the Republic of Congo’s ambassador to the US, said in an email to CNN in March: “There is no truth or any sign nor a single fact supporting such a claim or statement.”
There were also some Congolese migrants apprehended at the US border under Trump. You can read a more detailed fact check here.
Deportations to Central America
Trump repeated a story he has told on numerous previous occasions about how, during President Barack Obama’s administration, it was impossible to deport violent criminals to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.
“In the case of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, some others, you couldn’t get ‘em back … under Obama, you couldn’t get ’em back,” he said. He repeated, “They wouldn’t take ’em back for Obama.”
Facts First: This claim remains false. In 2016, Obama’s last calendar year in office, none of these three countries were on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant” (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.
The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, noted to CNN in 2019 that in the 2016 fiscal year, ICE reported that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US. The same was true in the 2017 fiscal year, which encompassed the end of Obama’s presidency and the beginning of Trump’s. ICE did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.
ICE officials said there were some exceptions to the three countries’ general cooperativeness, but Trump’s general declaration that the countries were uncooperative was never true.
The legitimacy of the 2020 election 
Trump repeated his usual lie about the legitimacy of the 2020 election, saying his opponents have attempted to persecute him through the courts even though he did “nothing wrong” and merely complained about a “rigged election.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim about the election remains false. The 2020 election was not rigged, Trump lost fair and square to Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232, his opponents did not cheat and there is no evidence of any fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state.
We’ll leave aside Trump’s subjective claims about his legal cases.
Europe and aid to Ukraine 
Trump again claimed that European countries are not pulling their weight with regard to aid to Ukraine. He said, “With Ukraine, so we’re in for $250 billion and they’re in for about $71 billion.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. Through June, European countries had committed and provided more aid to Ukraine than the US had during and just before the Russian invasion began in early 2022, according to data from the Kiel Institute for the World Economy think tank in Germany.
The Kiel Institute, which closely tracks aid to Ukraine, found that, from late January 2022 (just before Russia’s invasion in February 2022) through June 2024, the European Union and individual European countries had committed a total of about $205 billion to Ukraine, in military, financial and humanitarian assistance, compared to about $108 billion committed by the US. Europe also exceeded the US in aid that had actually been “allocated” to Ukraine – defined by the institute as aid either delivered or specified for delivery – at about $121 billion for Europe compared to about $82 billion for the US. 
The US led Europe on military aid that had actually been allocated, but very narrowly – about $56.42 billion to $56.35 billion.
It’s important to note that it’s possible to come up with different totals using different methodology. But Trump’s claim that the US has committed or provided far more aid than Europe is not true regardless.
Trade with Europe
Trump claimed, “If you build a car in the United States, you can’t sell it in Europe. You just can’t sell it. It’s impossible.”
Facts First: It’s not true that it’s impossible to sell a US-made car in Europe.
According to a December 2023 report from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, the EU is the second-largest market for US vehicle exports — importing 271,476 US vehicles in 2022, valued at nearly 9 billion euro. (Some of these are vehicles made by European automakers at plants in the US.) The EU’s Eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the US hit a new peak in 2020, Trump’s last full year in office, at a value of about 11 billion euro.
Iran and funding for terror groups
Touting his record in dealing with Iran, Trump claimed, “They had no money for Hamas, they had no money for Hezbollah, they had no money for any of these instruments of terror.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim that Iran had “no money” for terror groups during his presidency is false. Iran’s funding for these groups did decline in the second half of his administration, in large part because his sanctions on Iran had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped entirely, as four experts told CNN in June. Trump’s own administration said in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups including Hezbollah. 
The Trump administration began imposing sanctions on Iran in late 2018, pursuing a campaign known as “maximum pressure.” But Trump-appointed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said himself in 2020 that Iran was continuing to fund terror groups.
“So you continue to have, in spite of the Iranian leadership demanding that more money be given to them, they are using the resources that they have to continue funding Hezbollah in Lebanon and threatening the state of Israel, funding Iraqi terrorist Shia groups, all the things that they have done historically – continuing to build out their capabilities even while the people inside of their own country are suffering,” Pompeo said in a May 2020 interview, according to a transcript posted on the State Department’s website.
Trump could have fairly said that his sanctions on Iran had made life more difficult for terror groups (though it’s unclear how much their operations were affected). Instead, he continued his years-old practice of exaggerating even legitimate achievements.
You can read a more detailed fact check from June here.
China’s purchases of Iranian oil
Trump repeated his familiar claim that he successfully pressured China into no longer buying oil from Iran.
“Iran was broke because I told China, ‘If you buy from Iran…’ Oil, it’s all about the oil, that’s where the money is. ‘…If you buy oil from Iran, you’re not going to do any business with the United States.’ And I meant it, and they said, ‘We’ll pass,’ and they didn’t buy oil.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. China’s oil imports from Iran did briefly plummet under Trump in 2019, the year the Trump administration made a concerted effort to deter such purchases, but they never stopped – and then they rose sharply again while Trump was still president. “The claim is untrue because Chinese crude imports from Iran haven’t stopped at all,” Matt Smith, lead oil analyst for the Americas at Kpler, a market intelligence firm, said in November, when Trump made a similar claim.
China’s official statistics recorded no purchases of Iranian crude in Trump’s last partial month in office, January 2021, and also none in most of Biden’s first year in office. But that doesn’t mean China’s imports actually ceased; industry experts say it is widely known that China has used a variety of tactics to mask its continued imports from Iran.
Smith said Iranian crude is often listed in Chinese data as being from Malaysia; ships may travel from Iran with their transponders switched off and then turn them on when they are near Malaysia, Smith said, or transfer the Iranian oil to other ships.
Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a November email: “China significantly reduced its imports from Iran from around 800,000 barrels per day in 2018 to 100,000 in late 2019. But by the time Trump left office, they were back to upwards to 600(000)-700,000 barrels.”
Trump’s tax cuts
Trump repeated his regular claim that his signature tax cuts, in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, were “the largest tax cut” ever provided.
Facts First: Trump is wrong. Analyses have found that his tax cut law was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.
The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates.
In a report released earlier this year, the federal government’s Congressional Budget Office looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills were bigger – former President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush’s administration.
The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product – in other words, how much federal revenue a bill cut as a portion of the economy – over five years. Reagan’s 1981 tax cut and Obama’s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively. Trump’s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, found in 2017 that the framework for Trump’s tax cuts would make them the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the eighth largest since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product.
Military equipment and Afghanistan
After talking about the state of US military equipment, Trump said, “We gave $85 billion of it back to Afghanistan, if you can believe it. We gave them $85 billion.”
Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.
As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.
The situation before Right to Try
Trump claimed that before he signed a “Right to Try” law in 2018 to give terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven’t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, such patients would have no recourse if they did not have the money to travel abroad.
He said: “You know, people – if they had money, they’d go to Asia, they’d go to Europe. If they don’t have money, they’d go home and die. That’s what happened, they’d go home and die.”
Facts First: It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try law. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications – but the government almost always said yes.
Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump’s FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own “expanded access” program.
“Emergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,” Gottlieb testified.
The Biden administration and Trump’s legal cases
Trump repeated a claim he has made on numerous occasions during his campaign – that the Biden administration orchestrated a criminal election subversion case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, a criminal fraud case that was brought against him by a local district attorney in Manhattan, and a civil fraud case that was brought against him by the attorney general of New York state.
Facts First: This is false. There is no evidence that Biden or his administration were behind any of these cases. None of these officials reports to the president or even to the federal government.
Attorney General Merrick Garland testified to Congress in early June about the Manhattan case in which Trump was found guilty: “The Manhattan district attorney has jurisdiction over cases involving New York state law, completely independent of the Justice Department, which has jurisdiction over cases involving federal law. We do not control the Manhattan district attorney. The Manhattan district attorney does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law.”
As he did in his conversation with Musk, Trump has repeatedly invoked a lawyer on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team, Matthew Colangelo, while making such claims; Colangelo left the Justice Department in 2022 to join the district attorney’s office as senior counsel to Bragg. But there is no evidence that Biden had anything to do with Colangelo’s employment decision. Colangelo and Bragg were colleagues in the New York attorney general’s office before Bragg was elected Manhattan district attorney in 2021.

65,Fact Check,2024,8,"Fact check: Trump, who approved multiple prisoner exchanges, falsely claims he gave up ‘nothing’ to get Americans back",Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
In May, former President Donald Trump declared that he was the only person who could obtain the release of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich from a Russian prison. After President Joe Biden proved the claim wrong on Thursday by securing the release of Gershkovich and others in a multi-country prisoner exchange, Trump posted a series of skeptical questions on social media.
Among other things, Trump wrote: “Are we releasing murderers, killers, or thugs? Just curious because we never make good deals, at anything, but especially hostage swaps. Our ‘negotiators’ are always an embarrassment to us! I got back many hostages, and gave the opposing Country NOTHING – and never any cash. To do so is bad precedent for the future. That’s the way it should be, or this situation will get worse and worse.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim that he gave opposing countries “NOTHING” to secure the freedom of American prisoners is false. Though Trump obtained or helped to obtain the release of some Americans held abroad without having to release anyone in return, he also presided over at least four exchanges in which he approved the release of prisoners from US detention in exchange for foreign governments releasing Americans.
Biden White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday that no money was exchanged and no sanctions were loosened as part of the Thursday deal involving Gershkovich. You can read here about who else was freed in the 24-person swap.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby responded to Trump’s criticism on CNN Friday, pointing out that several Americans who were detained in Russia during Trump’s administration, such as Whelan and Trevor Reed, were later freed under Biden. “The previous administration also conducted prisoner exchanges. The previous administration also had to make tough decisions to get Americans home. … That’s what you have to do when you have people in harm’s way over there. You’ve got to make these tough decisions. It’s not easy.”
FactCheck.org debunked this Trump claim about his record on securing the release of American prisoners abroad when he previously made it in 2022. Here is a look at four prisoner exchanges under Trump, who is now the Republican presidential nominee – plus a case in which Trump said he had gotten an ally to release a suspected criminal as part of an attempted exchange.
A 2019 exchange with Iran
In 2019, the Trump administration secured the release of Xiyue Wang, a Princeton University PhD student who had been imprisoned in Iran since 2016, by agreeing to free an Iranian medical scientist who had been charged with trying to export biological materials from the US to Iran without authorization.
Trump acknowledged at the time that this was a prisoner exchange, telling reporters in 2019: “Yeah, we’re very happy to have our hostage back. The whole Princeton University community is very thrilled. And there was a one-on-one hostage swap.”
Federal prosecutors also dropped charges against the Iranian scientist’s two co-defendants soon after the prisoner exchange.
A 2019 exchange with the Taliban
In 2019, three high-ranking Taliban prisoners, who had been imprisoned by the government of Afghanistan, were released in exchange for the Taliban freeing two professors, American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, who were abducted in 2016. Trump and the president of Afghanistan made clear that the Trump administration was involved in the deal; Trump wrote on social media when the deal was announced: “Proud of my team!”
A 2020 exchange with Iran
In 2020, the Trump administration secured the release of Navy veteran Michael White, who had been imprisoned in Iran since 2018, by agreeing to free an Iranian-American doctor who had pleaded guilty to violating US sanctions on Iran by trying to export a medical device there without authorization.
Trump wrote on social media at the time: “Thank you to Iran, it shows a deal is possible!”
A 2020 exchange with the Iran-backed Houthis
In 2020, the Trump administration secured the release of two Americans who were imprisoned by Iran-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, aid worker Sandra Loli and businessman Mikael Gidada, in exchange for the release of more than 200 Houthi militants who were being held in Oman. Those Houthis were allowed to return to Yemen.
An attempted 2018 exchange with Turkey
Trump said in August 2018 that he had personally gotten Israel to free a Turkish citizen who had been charged with aiding Hamas as part of an attempted arrangement in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan would release American pastor Andrew Brunson.
Erdogan did not do so immediately, prompting Trump to criticize him. Erdogan released Brunson in October 2018.
Trump tweeted upon the release that “there was NO DEAL made with Turkey” and added, “I don’t make deals for hostages,” but his administration had already made clear that they had thought earlier in the year that there had been a deal.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/politics/fact-check-trump-falsely-claims-he-gave-up-nothing-american-prisoner-exchanges/index.html
66,Fact Check,2024,7,Fact check: Trump’s lie that Harris ‘all of a sudden’ embraced a Black identity,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, drew gasps on Wednesday when he said at the National Association of Black Journalists convention that Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, had suddenly adopted a Black identity.
Harris’ father is from Jamaica, her late mother from India. Trump claimed: “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly, not directly very much, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian, or is she Black?”
As one of the journalists who was interviewing Trump on stage tried to tell him that Harris had always identified as Black and had attended a historically Black college, Trump continued, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t. Because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn, and she went – she became a Black person. And I think somebody should look into that, too.”
Trump’s comments prompted immediate bipartisan criticism. Leaving aside the issue of the appropriateness of the remarks, his claims are just not true.
Facts First: Trump’s claims are false. Harris did not “all of a sudden” begin identifying as Black. She has embraced and discussed her Black identity for decades, beginning long before she became a political candidate, while also honoring her South Asian heritage.
Harris graduated in 1986 from Howard University, a historically Black institution where she was a member of a historically Black sorority. After that, she was elected president of the association of Black law students in her second year at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, she wrote in her 2019 memoir.
Politico reported in 2021 that, as a third-year student at the law school in 1989, Harris rose to speak against anti-Black racism at a campus demonstration prompted by the discovery of racist vandalism. Politico reported: “For Black students, she said, according to archives of the Hastings Law News, the cartoon was an example of ‘what we deal with all the time.’”
A profile of Harris in the publication AsianWeek in 2003, when she was running for San Francisco district attorney, was focused on her South Asian heritage. But it quoted Harris discussing her father as “a Black man” and saying, “I grew up with a strong Indian culture, and I was raised in a Black community. All my friends were Black and we got together and cooked Indian food and painted henna on our hands, and I never felt uncomfortable with my cultural background.”
Harris’ official online biography in 2005 as San Francisco district attorney referred to her as “the first African American woman in California to hold the office” and noted that she had attended “America’s oldest black university.” She wrote in a 2009 book about her childhood trips to both India and Jamaica, where, she wrote, “my father and uncles would talk to us about the complicated struggles of the people of Jamaica - the history of slavery, colonialism, and immigration.”
Her official online biography as California attorney general referred to her as “the first African American woman and South Asian American woman in California to hold the office” of San Francisco district attorney. In 2017, her first year as a US senator for California, she spoke about how she was “the second Black woman elected to the United States Senate.”
Harris wrote in the 2019 memoir about how her mother’s family instilled her and her sister Maya with “pride in our South Asian roots,” but also that “my mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.”
Harris said in another 2017 speech: “Look at my own life, where a daughter of a South Asian mother and a Jamaican father concluded her own interfaith wedding with her husband breaking a glass and everyone yelling, ‘Mazel tov.’”
A litany of Trump false claims
Trump made numerous other false claims in his remarks at the Wednesday gathering.
Among other claims we have fact-checked before, Trump:
- Wrongly referred to Harris as President Joe Biden’s “border czar.” Her actual immigration-related assignment from Biden, to lead a diplomatic effort to tackle “root causes” of migration in three Central American countries, was much more limited.
- Falsely claimed that the US has its worst inflation in “over 100 years.” Even at its 9.1% peak during the Biden presidency, inflation was at about a 41-year high, and it has since plummeted to 3%.
- Falsely claimed he was “protected” under the Presidential Records Act for taking official documents after his presidency. That law actually requires presidents to return all documents to the federal government when they leave office.
- Falsely claimed that “everybody,” including Democrats, wanted Roe v. Wade overturned and the issue of abortion policy returned to individual states. In fact, polls have consistently shown about two-thirds of the public as a whole and an even higher percentage of Democrats had wanted Roe to be preserved.
- Repeated his never-substantiated claim about foreign countries opening up their prisons to allow criminals to migrate to the US.
- Falsely claimed that Haris “didn’t pass” the bar exam. Harris failed on her first attempt, which is common in California, but then passed; she was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school. (Trump, appearing to respond to an objection from someone in the crowd, conceded a bit later that Harris “maybe” had passed.)
- Falsely claimed that “nobody died” on January 6, 2021. Four Trump supporters at the Capitol died that day, three from medical emergencies and one after she was shot by police while trying to break into a sensitive part of the building. (Trump mentioned the shooting right before he claimed nobody died.) In addition, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was attacked with pepper spray during the riot, died after suffering strokes the next day; the medical examiner found that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also told The Washington Post that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”

67,Fact Check,2024,7,Fact check: Harris campaign falsely claims 2021 video shows Vance endorsing Project 2025,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has falsely claimed on social media that a video clip from 2021 shows Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance endorsing a conservative initiative known as Project 2025.
Project 2025, an effort to lay out an agenda for a potential second Donald Trump presidency, was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed along with a variety of other conservative organizations.
The 920-page Project 2025 blueprint for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have been a central focus of Democratic attacks during the 2024 election campaign.
On the social media platform X on Saturday, the Harris campaign posted a video of Vance being interviewed by conservative media outlet The Federalist. The Harris campaign account @KamalaHQ, which has more than one million followers, described the video like this: “JD Vance endorses Project 2025: ‘We really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power … I don’t think there’s a compromise that we’re gonna come with … Unless we overthrow them in some way, we’re gonna keep losing.’”
Facts First: The Harris campaign’s claim that the video shows Vance endorsing Project 2025 is false. The video does not show Vance talking about Project 2025 at all. In fact, Project 2025 had not even been created at the time Vance made these comments in May 2021. The initiative was launched by The Heritage Foundation in April 2022, and its policy recommendations were released in April 2023.
The Harris campaign, which declined to comment for this article, did not acknowledge in the social media post that Vance’s comments were from more than three years ago.
A Harris campaign official told CNN last week – when Harris herself inaccurately described some of the contents of the Project 2025 policy document – that the campaign “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.”
No broad endorsement from Vance or Trump
There is no doubt that Trump and Vance have extensive ties to the people behind Project 2025. CNN previously reported that at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025. Vance wrote the foreward for a forthcoming book by The Heritage Foundation president and Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts.
But Roberts was not yet working for Heritage at the time of the May 2021 Vance comments the Harris campaign posted on Saturday, and contrary to the Harris campaign’s claim, Vance has not issued a broad public endorsement of the initiative itself. Vance said earlier in July, days before he became Trump’s running mate, that Project 2025 includes “some good ideas” and “some things that I disagree with” – adding that “most importantly, it has no affiliation with the Trump campaign.”
Trump has called unspecified Project 2025 proposals “seriously extreme” and “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” but has also said “many of the points are fine.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/30/politics/fact-check-harris-vance-project-2025/index.html
68,Fact Check,2024,7,"Fact check: Vance falsely claims Harris is calling to end the child tax credit, which she is actually calling to increase",Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance is facing criticism over his previous comments about people without children, including one 2021 remark denouncing “childless cat ladies” in government and another in which he said that, in order to “tax the things that are bad and not tax the things that are good,” people without children should pay a higher tax rate than people with children.
Vance is now trying to turn the tables on the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. In a Fox News interview that aired Sunday, Vance said, “I think a lot of parents and a lot of non-parents look at our public policy over the last four years and ask, ‘How did we get to this place? How did we get to a place where Kamala Harris is calling for an end to the child tax credit?’”
Facts First: Vance’s claim that Harris is calling to end the child tax credit is false. In fact, it is the opposite of reality: Harris has called for years to increase the child tax credit. As vice president, she has advocated for the permanent adoption of the enhanced child tax credit that was temporarily in effect in 2021 under a pandemic relief law – a law that was signed by President Joe Biden after it was passed by Congress with only Democratic support.
Spokespeople for Vance and the Trump-Vance campaign did not immediately respond to CNN’s Monday requests to offer any substantiation for Vance’s claim. But a Vance spokesperson, William Martin, argued to ABC News last week that “the policy Senator Vance proposed is basically no different than the Child Tax Credit, which Democrats unanimously support.”
That’s a far more debatable assertion than Vance’s own claim on Fox News that Harris is calling to end the child tax credit, which is just wrong. Erica York, senior economist and research director at The Tax Foundation think tank, said in a Monday email that Vance’s claim is “false.”
“VP Harris has not called to end the child tax credit, has regularly highlighted the significant expansion of the credit the Biden-Harris administration oversaw during the pandemic, and has a history of supporting expansions to the credit,” York said.
Vance prefaced his 2021 comments about tax policy and children by speaking of his desire to use policy to “reward the things that we think are good” and “punish the things that we think are bad.”
York noted that the “ultimate effect” of the child tax credit is that people with children have lower tax rates than people without children, but she said Vance “misleadingly” equated the Harris campaign’s criticism of his 2021 comments with opposition to the existence of the child tax credit.
Vance’s claim on Fox News was not a one-time slip. He made a similar comment last week in an interview with conservative host Megyn Kelly, saying, “Why do we have the Harris campaign coming out this very morning, Megyn, and saying that we should not have the child tax credit?” The Harris campaign has not said that.
Harris has repeatedly called to expand the child tax credit
Harris’ support for an expanded child tax credit predates her vice presidency. In 2018, as a US senator for California, Harris co-sponsored a Democratic bill to increase the credit. She co-sponsored another version of that expansion bill in 2019, when she was running in the Democratic presidential primary.
As vice president, Harris has made numerous comments in support of returning to the enhanced child tax credit that was authorized as a one-year temporary measure by Biden’s 2021 American Rescue Plan pandemic relief law.
The temporary expansion – which increased the maximum amount of the credit, made the credit fully refundable so the lowest-income families could qualify and sent out half of the credit in monthly payments – was a major contributor to a steep decline in child poverty in 2021. Child poverty then spiked in 2022, roughly to pre-pandemic levels, after Congress allowed the expanded credit to expire against the wishes of Biden and Harris.
A bipartisan House bill that would expand the child tax credit again has stalled in the Senate this year amid Republican opposition.
Harris posted on social media in March: “President Biden and I cut child poverty nearly in half after expanding the Child Tax Credit for millions of working families. It’s time for Congress to restore the full expanded Child Tax Credit.” She posted in March 2023: “The expanded Child Tax Credit cut the child poverty rate nearly in half during the first year of our Administration. Our budget restores this tax credit permanently because we believe it is our duty to invest in our nation’s children.”
She has also talked up the 2021 expansion of the child tax credit on the campaign trail in recent weeks.
In a July 18 speech before Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, she said, “Whereas the last administration gave tax cuts to billionaires, we gave tax cuts to families through the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in America by half.” She touted the expansion again in a speech to a historically Black sorority after Biden dropped out, saying, “We believe in a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, which is why I helped pass the child tax credit, which cut child poverty in half and cut Black child poverty even more.”

69,Fact Check,2024,7,"Fact check: Trump revives false claim that he, not Minnesota’s governor, deployed the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020",Daniel Dale,"CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump has revived his four-year-old false claim about how he and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz handled the civil unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020.
Walz is among the Democrats whom sources say Vice President Kamala Harris is considering as a potential running mate. Trump, the Republican nominee, claimed during a Saturday campaign speech in Minnesota: “Every voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago — remember me? I couldn’t get your governor to act. He’s supposed to call in the National Guard or the Army. And he didn’t do it. I couldn’t get your governor. So I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis.” (Trump went on to criticize Harris for her own response to the unrest.)
CNN fact-checked this Trump story in July 2020. But he has repeated the tale on multiple subsequent occasions, including an abbreviated version during his June 2024 presidential debate with President Joe Biden.
Facts First: Trump’s claims that he sent the National Guard to Minneapolis in 2020 and that Walz refused to do so are both wrong. Walz, not Trump, sent the National Guard to Minneapolis — and Walz first deployed the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. 
The Minnesota National Guard, the entity that Walz deployed, is under the command of the governor, not the president. The president has the power to federalize states’ Guard troops under certain circumstances, but Trump never did so during the 2020 unrest in Minnesota.
After Trump began telling this false story in June 2020, Walz spokesperson Teddy Tschann provided a statement to CNN in the form of a question-and-answer sheet. It said, among other things: “Did President Trump ‘call out’ the Guard? No.” “Did Gov. Walz call out the Guard? Yes.” “Did Gov. Walz call out the National Guard at the direction of the President? No. He activated the Minnesota National Guard at the request of the Mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, before he talked to the White House.”
Evidence shows Trump’s claim is false
Public evidence confirms that Walz, who served in the Army National Guard from 1981 to 2005, deployed the Guard himself in May 2020.
Floyd was killed on May 25, 2020. There were protests in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, some of them involving violence. And there was looting, violence and arson, along with peaceful protest, on May 27, 2020.
On May 28, 2020, Walz issued a press release just after 4 p.m. local time announcing he had signed an executive order activating the Minnesota National Guard. At 4:13 p.m. local time that day, the Minnesota National Guard announced on social media that adjutant general Maj. Gen. Jon Jensen had said, “We are ready and prepared to answer the Governor’s request. We are currently in process of assigning and preparing units to respond.”
At 10:41 p.m. local time that night, after a Minneapolis police precinct building was set on fire, the Minnesota National Guard announced that “we have activated more than 500 soldiers to St. Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding communities.”
Then, at 11:53 p.m. local time, Trump posted twice on social media.
In one post, Trump threatened to send in the Guard if Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey did not “get his act together and bring the City under control.” In the other post, Trump wrote, “Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!”
In neither post did Trump claim to have been the person who sent in the Guard. He began publicly making such claims in June 2020.
Walz has been criticized by both Republicans and some Democrats for his handling of the unrest. Frey said in August 2020 that he had verbally asked Walz on the evening of May 27, 2020 to send in the Guard but that Walz had hesitated; Walz pushed back on Frey’s account, saying the mayor’s May 27, 2020 comments on the call had not constituted an official request, which came in writing the next day.
Regardless of what happened in their conversation or the merits of how Walz managed the crisis, it is indisputable that Walz, not Trump, was the person who activated the Guard. Similarly, while it’s possible that Trump’s public pressure contributed to Walz’s May 30, 2020 decision to greatly increase the size of the deployment by mobilizing the entire Minnesota National Guard — though Walz’s office denied in 2020 that Trump had anything to do with it —  this increase, too, was indisputably Walz’s act, not Trump’s.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/28/politics/fact-check-minnesota-trump-speech-national-guard/index.html
70,Fact Check,2024,7,Fact check: Trump made at least 10 false claims about Kamala Harris in a single rally speech,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump made at least 10 false claims about Vice President Kamala Harris in his first campaign rally since she became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee.
Trump, speaking in North Carolina, attacked Harris at length with a flurry of assertions about her personal and political past, her record as vice president and her policy stances. We’re still looking into some of his claims, but at least 10 were wrong.
Here is a fact check.
Harris and the retirement age
Discussing Social Security, Trump claimed of President Joe Biden and Harris: “They’re talking about, he was talking, she’s talking about – lifting the retirement age.”
Facts First: This claim is false about Harris. She has not spoken in favor of raising the age for receiving Social Security retirement benefits. (Biden did, as a US senator in the 2000s and prior, express support for or openness to raising the retirement age, but he has been a vocal opponent of the idea as president.)
Harris has supported increasing, not reducing, Social Security benefits. In 2019, about two years before she became vice president, she co-sponsored a bill from Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, called the Social Security Expansion Act, that would boost Social Security benefits by raising payroll taxes on high earners.
Harris and abortion
Trump said, “She wants abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy, that’s fine with her, right up until birth, and even after birth – the execution of a baby.” 
Facts First: Trump’s claim that Harris supports the execution of babies after birth is false. She has never said anything to endorse post-birth murder, which is illegal everywhere in the country; Trump has frequently claimed that some Democratic states allow such post-birth executions, but that claim is false, too.
Harris, a vocal supporter of abortion rights, has declined to endorse specific limits on how late in a pregnancy an abortion should be permitted to occur. According to data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 0.9% of reported abortions in 2020 occurred at 21 weeks gestation or later. Many of these abortions occur because of serious health risks or lethal fetal anomalies.
Harris has called for legislation restoring the protections of the Roe v. Wade decision that was overturned by the Supreme Court in 2022; Roe allowed states to restrict abortion after the point of fetal viability, often considered to be around 23 to 24 weeks gestation, with exceptions for abortions necessary to protect the patient’s life or health. As a senator and vice president, Harris has supported a bill that would, like Roe, ensure abortion was available at least until fetal viability – and would also prohibit various state policies that make the process of providing or obtaining an abortion more onerous.
Asked about Trump’s comments, the Trump campaign provided various examples of Harris taking liberal positions on abortion policy and declining to endorse specific limits - but nothing to substantiate the claim that she supports “the execution of a baby” after birth.
Harris and red meat
Trump claimed, “Kamala even wants to pass laws to outlaw red meat to stop climate change.”
Facts First: This is false. Harris has never expressed support for passing laws to outlaw red meat. At a CNN climate change town hall in 2019, when she was running in the Democratic presidential primary, she expressed support for changing dietary guidelines to try to encourage Americans to reduce their consumption of red meat, but she also said “I love cheeseburgers from time to time” and that she favored using “incentives” and education to encourage healthy eating. 
After mentioning sodas and foods with copious sugar, Harris said in this same town hall answer that “the balance that we have to strike here, frankly, is about what government can and should do around creating incentives and then banning certain behaviors.” The phrase “banning certain behaviors” opened the door to claims that she wants to ban red meat. But she immediately proceeded to her comments about how she enjoys cheeseburgers and favors incentives to prod changes in behavior – making clear in context that she was expressing support for incentives rather than bans.
Asked about Trump’s claim about Harris wanting to outlaw red meat, the Trump campaign provided two citations that did not substantiate it: a YouTube video of Harris’ comments that was correctly titled “Kamala Harris Wants The Government To Create ‘Incentives’ For Americans to Eat Less Meat” and an article headlined, “Flashback: Kamala Harris said she would support eating less meat if elected president.”
Harris and Trump’s legal cases
Trump has claimed for months that Biden secretly orchestrated his criminal and civil legal cases. This time, he directed the claim at Harris. He said, “But it was all headed up by her. Because she’s a prosecutor.”
Facts First: This is false. There is simply no basis for claiming that Harris “headed up” the legal cases against him. Trump has never presented any evidence for this claim that Biden was the hidden hand behind his cases, let alone for suddenly switching the claim to make it about the vice president after months of saying it about the president.
There is no sign that Harris had any role in bringing charges against Trump in Manhattan, New York (where he was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records) or Fulton County, Georgia (where an election subversion case against Trump is on hold); those prosecutions have been led by elected local district attorneys. Trump’s two federal cases, one dismissed by a judge earlier this month, were brought by a special counsel, Jack Smith. Smith was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, a Biden appointee, but that is not proof that Biden orchestrated the prosecutions – and certainly not proof that Harris did.
Harris’ immigration role
Trump claimed of Harris: “She was the border czar, but she never went to the border.”
Facts First: Trump made two false claims here. First, Harris did go to the border as vice president, in Texas in mid-2021; many Republicans had criticized Harris prior to the visit for not having gone, and some later argued that she didn’t go frequently enough, but the claim that she “never” went has not been true for more than three years. Second, Harris was never made Biden’s “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.
Some Republicans have scoffed this week at assertions that Harris was never the “border czar,” noting on social media that news articles sometimes described Harris as such. But those articles were wrong. Various news outlets, including CNN, reported as early as the first half of 2021 that the White House emphasized that Harris had not been put in charge of border security as a whole, as “border czar” strongly suggests, and had instead been handed a diplomatic task related to Central American countries.
A White House “fact sheet” in July 2021 said: “On February 2, 2021, President Biden signed an Executive Order that called for the development of a Root Causes Strategy. Since March, Vice President Kamala Harris has been leading the Administration’s diplomatic efforts to address the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.”
Biden’s own comments at a March 2021 event announcing the assignment were slightly more muddled, but he said he had asked Harris to lead “our diplomatic effort” to address factors causing migration in the three “Northern Triangle” countries (he also mentioned Mexico that day). Biden listed factors in these countries he thought had led to migration and said that “if you deal with the problems in-country, it benefits everyone.” And Harris’ comments that day were focused squarely on “root causes.”
Republicans can fairly say that even “root causes” work is a border-related task. But calling her “border czar” goes too far.
Harris and the number of migrants
Trump claimed that Harris “allowed 20 million illegal aliens to stampede into our country from all over the world.”
Facts First: Leaving aside Trump’s claim about Harris’ own responsibility for migration levels, the“20 million” figure is false, a major exaggeration. The total number of “encounters” at the northern and southern border from February 2021 through June 2024, at both legal ports of entry and in between those ports, was about 10 million – and an “encounter” does not mean a person was let into the country; some people encountered are promptly sent away.
Even if you added the estimated number of Biden-era “gotaways” (people who evaded the Border Patrol to enter illegally), which House Republicans said in May was nearly two million, “the totals would still be vastly smaller than 15, 16 or 18 million,” Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute think tank, said in late June after Trump used those figures.
The “encounters” figures can’t be described as figures on people successfully entering the US. Some encounters involve people who are deemed inadmissible at legal ports and are refused permission to enter. Also, the same person can be “encountered” multiple times if they keep returning to the border to try again – which is what happened in many cases under Biden when the Title 42 rapid-expulsion authority invoked by Trump during the Covid-19 pandemic was in place into May 2023.
Harris and fentanyl deaths
Shortly after claiming there is a “Kamala Harris invasion” of the border, Trump said, “We’re losing 300,000 people a year through fentanyl that comes through our border.”
Facts First: Trump’s “300,000” claim is false. The number of US overdose deaths in 2023 involving synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, was approximately 75,000, according to estimated and provisional data published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC said in May that roughly 107,500 people in the US died from a drug overdose involving any kind of drug in 2023; even that larger number is nowhere close to Trump’s “300,000.”  
When Trump made similar “300,000” claims earlier this year, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University, said “I have no idea where Trump is getting ‘300,000’ from and called it “a made-up number.”
While Kolodny said it’s likely that the number of US overdose deaths is undercounted, there is no apparent basis for Trump’s insistence that the real number is nearly triple the reported number. And Kolodny said the undercount issue is centered not on overdoses from illicit fentanyl smuggled across the southern border but on seniors’ overdoses from accidentally taking too much of their legal prescription medications.
It is also worth noting that fentanyl is largely smuggled by US citizens through legal ports of entry rather than by migrants sneaking into the country.
CNN’s Jen Christensen contributed to this item.
Harris and the Jewish community
Trump criticized Harris for not attending Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Wednesday speech to Congress (though Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, also did not attend); Harris, who is planning to hold a meeting with Netanyahu on Thursday, traveled to Indianapolis on Wednesday to give a previously scheduled speech to a historically Black sorority.
That’s fair game for criticism. But Trump said after criticizing Harris’ absence: “Even if you’re against Israel or you’re against the Jewish people, show up and listen to the concept. But she’s totally against the Jewish people.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim that Harris is “totally against the Jewish people” is nonsense. Harris has been married to a Jewish man, Doug Emhoff, for nearly 10 years – and she has repeatedly denounced antisemitism, expressed fondness for the Jewish community and its traditions, complimented Israel at length, and endorsed “America’s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel.” Though she has sometimes been pointedly critical of the actions of Israel’s government during the war in Gaza, drawing criticism from conservative Jews and others, there is no evidence she has a general antipathy toward “the Jewish people” as Trump claimed.
The Jewish Telegraphic Agency news service reported this week: “Over the course of her life and career, she has been surrounded by Jews, from her schoolmates to her colleagues to her closest family members. That background has given Harris, 59, an easy familiarity with Jewish spaces, say those who have interacted with her. She has also encouraged Emhoff to embrace his Jewish identity as the second gentleman; for the first time, mezuzahs have been installed at the vice presidential residence, and Emhoff has taken a leading role in the administration’s efforts to fight antisemitism.”
Harris and the bar exam
Trump claimed that Harris, a lawyer who was elected as San Francisco’s district attorney and then as California’s attorney general, “failed her law exams.” Then he continued, “You know that? She couldn’t pass her bar. She couldn’t pass her bar exams…Does anyone know that? … But she’s gonna be a great president, right? No, she couldn’t pass her bar exams. She couldn’t pass anything. Couldn’t pass everything. She couldn’t pass anything.”
Facts First: It’s not true that Harris “couldn’t pass anything.” She did fail on her first attempt to pass the bar exam, according to The New York Times, but then succeeded. She was admitted to the California bar in 1990, the year after she graduated from law school. 
Trump could fairly say that Harris couldn’t initially pass the bar exam, but his rally comments made it sound like she never passed at all.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/25/politics/fact-check-trump-false-claims-kamala-harris/index.html
71,Fact Check,2024,7,Fact check: Harris falsely claims Project 2025 blueprint calls for cutting Social Security,Daniel Dale,"Washington
CNN
 — 
In the first rally of her presidential campaign on Tuesday, presumptive Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris wrongly described parts of the conservative Project 2025 blueprint for a potential second Donald Trump presidency.
The 920-page Project 2025 blueprint was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration; Trump has publicly distanced himself from the initiative, calling unspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.” Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism.
At Harris’ Tuesday rally in Wisconsin, she criticized Trump and “his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” then said: “Can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it. It’s 900 pages. But here’s the thing. When you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. They intend to end the Affordable Care Act. And take us back, then, to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions.”
Facts First: One of Harris’ claims about Project 2025 is false, while another is at least misleading. The Project 2025 document does not show that Trump intends to cut Social Security; the document barely discusses Social Security at all and does not propose cuts to the program. In addition, contrary to Harris’ suggestion, Project 2025 does not call to “end” the Affordable Care Act or eliminate its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The document does criticize the Affordable Care Act, especially the law’s expansion of Medicaid, but makes clear it is advocating changes to the law rather than terminating the law entirely.
A Harris campaign official said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.” ﻿After the initial publication of this article, a Harris campaign spokesperson, Joseph Costello, added, “Project 2025 is a blueprint for many of the dangerous policies we know that a second Trump term would include, and it is indisputable that in his first term, Donald Trump repeatedly tried to cut Social Security and end the Affordable Care Act.”
Mary Vought, a spokesperson for Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation, said, “Harris should follow her own advice and read the book instead of promoting lies and misinformation.”
No Project 2025 call to cut Social Security
We won’t render a verdict on Harris’ claim about Project 2025 calling for cuts to Medicare, though Trump himself has vowed he will not cut even a cent from the health insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities. The Project 2025 document proposes multiple significant changes to Medicare, and it’s not clear what their overall impact would be.
And there is a reasonable basis for Harris’ claim about Project 2025 wanting to give tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations. The project’s proposals to significantly restructure the tax code include a reduction in the corporate income tax rate and ideas that would disproportionately benefit high earners. Trump’s own proposal to extend the expiring provisions of his 2017 tax cut law also favors wealthy people.
But contrary to Harris’ claim that “when you read” the Project 2025 document “you will see” that Trump intends to cut Social Security, the lengthy document includes no call to cut Social Security. In fact, the document uses the words “Social Security” just 10 times, mostly in passing. Vought said the document calls for “no changes to Social Security.”
Harris could fairly have noted that Trump himself has expressed openness, both in decades past and earlier this year, to cutting Social Security. When he was asked in a March interview about how he would handle Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, he said, “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements.” (He has since vowed not to cut “one penny” from Social Security or Medicare.)
But what Harris actually said is that the proof of a supposed Trump intention to cut Social Security in a second term is found in the Project 2025 document. It is not.
No Project 2025 call to end the Affordable Care Act
Harris at least suggested at the rally, though did not explicitly say, that the Project 2025 document includes a call to end the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But that’s not correct, either.
The document criticizes the budget impact of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program for lower-income people. It also explicitly calls for some changes to the Affordable Care Act – popularly known as Obamacare – or its implementation. Those suggested changes include removing restrictions on physician-owned and specialty hospitals, better enforcing a provision of the law related to how insurers must handle money related to abortion, and coming up with “a plan to separate the non-subsidized insurance market from the subsidized market.”
But the document makes no mention of changes to Affordable Care Act protections for people with pre-existing conditions. And its suggestions for changes to the law are clearly not suggestions to get rid of the law entirely. “It does not end the Affordable Care Act,” Vought said.
Trump himself repeatedly promised during his 2016 election campaign to “terminate” Obamacare and replace it with an unspecified superior plan, but failed to achieve his goal as president. In a social media post during this campaign, in November 2023, he said he was “seriously looking at alternatives” to Obamacare, criticized Republican senators who had voted “not to terminate” the law, and added that “we should never give up!”
Then, four days later, he wrote, “I don’t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!”

72,Fact Check,2024,7,Fact check: Trump makes more than 20 false claims in RNC acceptance speech,,"CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump accepted the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday with the most dishonest speech of the four-day Republican National Convention, making more than 20 false claims by CNN’s count.
Many of the false claims were ones Trump has made before, some of them for years. They spanned a wide variety of topics, including the economy, immigration, crime, foreign policy and elections. Some of them were wild lies, others smaller exaggerations. Some were in his prepared text (like the absurd claim that he left the Biden administration a world at peace), while he ad-libbed others (such as his usual lies that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election and that the US is experiencing the worst inflation it has ever had).
Below is a fact check of some of Trump’s false or misleading remarks, plus a fact check of claims made by other Thursday convention speakers.
Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden.
Former President Donald Trump claimed that there is record inflation under President Joe Biden.
Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. The current inflation rate, 3% in June 2024, is nowhere near the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920.
Trump could fairly say that the inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but it has since plummeted.

Trump’s misleading claim about North Korean missile launches during his presidency
Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that he “got along with” North Korea’s Kim Jong Un and “we stopped the missile launches from North Korea.”
“But, no, I got along with him,” Trump said, “and we stopped the missile launches from North Korea. Now North Korea is acting up again.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim that he “stopped the missile launches” from North Korea is misleading. While missile launches did pause from North Korea for a period of time during his administration, they started up again before he left office. 
A May 2019 launch of what was assessed to be a short-range ballistic missile was North Korea’s first since 2017, which was seen as a sign of growing frustration from Kim on the state of talks with the US. North Korea later launched two more missiles in July 2019, a month after Trump’s high-profile meeting with Kim in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. North Korea conducted four missile tests in 2020.

Trump on his claims of defeating ISIS in “couple of months”
Former President Donald Trump claimed in his RNC speech that “we defeated 100% of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, something that was going to take five years. … We did it in a matter of a couple of months.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim of having defeated ISIS in “a couple of months” isn’t true; the ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency, in 2019.
Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq in late December 2018, as he has suggested in past remarks, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has before, when he said he defeated the terror group with no caveats or credit to anyone else. Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016.
IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump’s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. “The Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group’s governance project,” an analyst there said in a statement at the time.

Donald Trump’s misleading claim that federal judge ruled case against him was ‘unconstitutional’
Donald Trump said Thursday that the Florida federal judge who was overseeing the classified documents case dismissed the criminal charges against the former president, finding “that the prosecutor and the fake documents case against me were totally unconstitutional.”
Facts first: Trump’s claim is misleading. District Judge Aileen Cannon wrote in her ruling that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith, who was prosecuting the case, violated the Constitution. But Cannon specifically did not comment on the validity of the charges Trump was facing, or whether Trump’s alleged mishandling of classified documents was proper.
In a 93-page ruling Monday, Cannon said Smith’s appointment violated the Constitution. Cannon said that Smith’s position as special counsel “effectively usurps” Congress’ “important legislative authority,” because Congress should have the authority – not the head of the Justice Department – to appoint such an official.
Cannon also said that Smith’s office was being funded improperly.
But Cannon also specifically noted that she was not deciding any “other legal rights or claims” brought by Trump or his co-defendants in the case.
The judge also said that the Justice Department could potentially revive the case by funding the special counsel through different means. Prosecutors from outside the special counsel’s office could also refile the charges.

Trump on the impact of immigration on Medicare and Social Security
During his Republican National Convention speech, former President Donald Trump again said that Democrats are harming Social Security and Medicare by letting migrants into the US.
“Democrats are going to destroy Social Security and Medicare because all of these people by the millions are coming in – they’re going to be on Social Security and Medicare and other things, and you’re not able to afford it. They are destroying your Social Security and your Medicare,” Trump said.
Facts First: Trump is wrong. In fact, the opposite is true, particularly in the near term, multiple experts say. Many undocumented immigrants work, which means they pay much-needed payroll taxes, and this bolsters the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and extends their solvency. Immigrants who are working legally typically won’t collect benefits for many years. As for those who are undocumented, some are working under fake Social Security numbers, so they are paying payroll taxes but don’t qualify to collect benefits.
The Social Security Administration looked at the effects of unauthorized immigration on the Social Security trust funds. It found that in 2010, earnings by unauthorized workers contributed roughly $12 billion on net to the entitlement program’s cash flow. The agency has not updated the analysis since, but this year’s Social Security trustees report noted that increasing average annual total net immigration by 100,000 persons improves the entitlement program’s solvency.
“We estimate that future years will experience a continuation of this positive impact on the trust funds,” said the report on unauthorized immigration.
Meanwhile, unauthorized immigrants contributed more than $35 billion on net to Medicare’s trust fund between 2000 and 2011, extending the life of the trust fund by a year, according to a study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.
“Immigrants tend to be younger and employed, which increases the number of workers paying into the system,” said Gary Engelhardt, a Syracuse University economics professor. “Also, they have more children, which helps boost the future workforce that will pay payroll taxes.”
“Immigrants are good for Social Security,” he said.
However, undocumented immigrants who gain legal status that includes eligibility for future Social Security and Medicare benefits could ultimately be a drain to the system, according to Jason Richwine, a resident scholar at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration.
“Illegal immigration unambiguously benefits the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, but amnesty (legalization) would reverse those gains and add extra costs,” Richwine wrote in a report last year.

Trump on trade deal with China
Former President Donald Trump claimed that he struck a trade deal with China, requiring the country to purchase $50 billion worth of American products. “They buy $50 billion worth,” he said at the Republican National Convention Thursday.
Facts First: The claim that China bought $50 billion worth of American product as a result of a trade deal is false.
Trump is referring to what is known as the Phase One deal he struck with Beijing in December 2019.
While the deal required China to buy $50 billion worth of American agricultural products by the end of 2021 – Beijing did not live up to its commitment.
US agricultural exports to China recovered from the trade war but did not reach the levels in the Phase One commitments, according to a study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Donald Trump exaggerates how much higher gas prices are right now
Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump described gas prices inaccurately during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention. He said that “gas prices are up 60%.”
Facts First: The average price of a regular gallon of gasoline nationwide is $3.51 as of Thursday, according to AAA. That’s up about 47% from the day President Joe Biden was inaugurated, when the average was $2.39, not 60% higher as Trump claimed.
Although the United States has a strategic gasoline reserve, which can be tapped by the White House to ease upward pressure on prices, as Biden did in May, gas prices are still mostly determined by market forces, such as global petroleum production and consumer demand, not solely by the decisions of a sitting US president.

Trump claims government hired 88,000 IRS agents
Former President Donald Trump, while recounting a conversation he had with a waitress worried about the taxes on her tips, claimed that the government recently hired 88,000 IRS agents to audit individuals.
Facts First: This claim is false. 
The Inflation Reduction Act – which Congress passed in 2022 without any Republican votes – provided an about $80 billion, 10-year investment to the IRS. The agency plans to hire tens of thousands of IRS employees with that money – but only some will be IRS agents who conduct audits and investigations. Many people will be hired for non-agent roles, such as customer service representatives. And a significant number of the hires are expected to fill the vacant posts left by retirements and other attrition, not take newly created positions.
The 88,000 figure comes from a 2021 Treasury Department report that estimated the IRS could hire 86,852 full-time employees – not solely enforcement agents – over the course of a decade with a nearly $80 billion investment.

Trump on Biden increasing Americans’ taxes by four times
Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim that President Joe Biden wants to hike people’s taxes by four times.
“This is the only administration that said, ‘We’re gonna raise your taxes by four times what you’re paying now,’” Trump said Thursday in his speech at the Republican National Convention.
Facts First: This is false, just as it was when Trump made the same claim during the 2020 election campaign and in early 2024. 
Biden has not proposed quadrupling Americans’ taxes, and there has never been any indication that he is seeking to do so. The nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center think tank, which analyzed Biden’s never-implemented budget proposals for fiscal 2024, found this: “His plan would raise average after-tax incomes for low-income households in 2024, leave them effectively unchanged for middle-income households, and lower after-tax incomes significantly for the highest-income taxpayers.”
The Tax Policy Center found that Biden’s proposal would, on average, have raised taxes by about $2,300 – but that’s about a 2.3% decline in after-tax income, not the massive reduction Trump is suggesting Biden wants. And critically, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman noted to CNN in May that 95% of the tax hike would have been covered by the highest-income 5% of households.
The very biggest burden under the Biden plan would have been carried by the very richest households; the Tax Policy Center found that households in the top 0.1% would have seen their after-tax incomes decline by more than 20%. That’s “a lot,” Gleckman noted, but it’s still nowhere near the quadrupling Trump claims Biden is looking for. And again, even this increase would have been only for a tiny subset of the population. Biden has promised not to raise taxes by even a cent for anyone making under $400,000 per year.

Trump’s claim on the situation before the ‘Right to Try’ law
Former President Donald Trump touted the “Right to Try” law he signed in 2018 in his convention speech Thursday, which gave terminally ill patients easier access to experimental medications that haven’t yet received approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
Before the measure was passed, Trump claimed, terminally ill patients in the United States would have to go to foreign countries to seek experimental treatments or go home to die if they couldn’t afford it.
“Sounds simple, but it’s not, and I got them to agree that somebody that needs it will –  instead of going to Asia or Europe or some place – or if you have no money, going home and dying,” he said.
Facts First: This is misleading. It is not true that terminally ill patients would simply have to go home and die without any access to experimental medications or would have to go to foreign countries seeking such treatments until Trump signed the Right to Try. Prior to the law, patients had to ask the federal government for permission to access experimental medications – but the government almost always said yes.
Scott Gottlieb, who served as Trump’s FDA commissioner, told Congress in 2017 that the FDA had approved 99% of patient requests under its own “expanded access” program.
‘“Emergency requests for individual patients are usually granted immediately over the phone and non-emergency requests are generally processed within a few days,” Gottlieb testified.

Trump’s claim about Russian warships near Cuba
Former President Donald claimed in his RNC speech on Wednesday evening that “Russian warships and nuclear submarines are operating 60 miles off our coasts in Cuba. … The press refuses to write about it.”
Facts First: Trump’s present-tense claim that Russian warships and nuclear submarines “are” operating close to the United States is misleading. While Russia did have a nuclear-powered submarine visiting Cuba in June along with other Russian Navy vessels, all of the vessels – including the submarine – have since left.
A group of four Russian Navy vessels arrived in Cuba on June 12 as part of what Pentagon and State Department officials stressed is a routine activity and noted that Cuba has hosted Russian ships every year between 2013 and 2020. A Pentagon spokesperson, Maj. Charlie Dietz, said in June that “given Russia’s long history of Cuban port calls, these are considered routine naval visits, especially in the context of increased US support to Ukraine and NATO exercises.”
The vessels left Havana on June 17.
It is also not true that media organizations “don’t want to talk about it.” CNN, along with most other major news outlets, reported on the Russian ships’ positioning.

Trump on military equipment left in Afghanistan
Former President Donald Trump repeated his claim, which he has made in speech after speech, that the US left $85 billion worth of military equipment to the Taliban when Biden pulled American troops out of Afghanistan in 2021.
Trump said, “And we also left $85 billion dollars’ worth of military equipment.”
Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.
As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment.

Trump’s false claim that the ‘world was at peace’ during his administration
Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday, as many others at the RNC did, that while he was president the world was at peace.
“Our opponents inherited a world at peace and turned it into a planet of war,” he also claimed later in his speech.
Facts First: Trump’s claim about world peace under his presidency is false. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021.   
US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia’s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa’s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico’s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine’s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world.
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021.

Trump on Venezuela’s crime rate
Former President Donald Trump said Thursday at the Republican National Convention that “in Venezuela, crime is down 72%” because foreign governments are sending their countries’ criminals to the US.
Facts First: Trump greatly overstated the Biden-era decline in crime in Venezuela, at least according to the limited statistics that are publicly available. 
And while it is certain that at least some criminals have joined law-abiding Venezuelans in a mass exodus from the country amid the economic crisis of the last decade, there is no proof Venezuela’s government has deliberately emptied prisons for migration purposes or intentionally sent ex-prisoners to the United States.

Trump’s evidence-free claim on immigration
Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that immigrants are “coming from prisons, they’re coming from jails, they’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. … Terrorists are coming in at numbers we’ve never seen before.”
Facts First: There is no evidence for Trump’s claim that jails around the world are being emptied out so that prisoners can travel to the US as migrants, nor for his claim that foreign governments are also emptying out mental health facilities for this purpose. Last year, Trump’s campaign was unable to provide any evidence for his narrower claim at the time that South American countries in particular were emptying their mental health facilities to somehow dump patients upon the US.
Representatives for two anti-immigration organizations told CNN at the time they had not heard of anything that would corroborate Trump’s story, as did three experts at organizations favorable toward immigration. CNN’s own search did not produce any evidence. The website FactCheck.org also found nothing.
Trump has sometimes tried to support his claim by making another claim that the global prison population is down. But that’s wrong, too. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from about 10.77 million people to about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
In response to CNN’s 2023 inquiry, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung cited one source for Trump’s claim about prisons being emptied for migration purposes – a 2022 article from right-wing website Breitbart News about a supposed federal intelligence report warning Border Patrol agents that Venezuela had done this. But that vague and unverified claim about Venezuela’s actions has never been corroborated.

Trump’s false claim on US crime statistics
Former President Donald Trump claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that “our crime rate is going up, while crime statistics all over the world are going down.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim about a dramatic increase in the crime rate is false. Official data published by the FBI shows violent crime dropped significantly in the US in 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024, though there were increases in some communities; violent crime is now lower than it was in 2020, President Donald Trump’s last calendar year in office.
Preliminary FBI data for 2023 showed a roughly 13% national decline in murder and a roughly 6% national decline in overall reported violent crime compared to 2022, bringing both murder and violent crime levels below where they were in 2020. And preliminary FBI data for the first quarter of 2024 showed an even steeper drop from the same quarter in 2023 – a roughly 26% decline in murder and roughly 15% decline in overall reported violent crime.
There are limitations to the FBI-published data, which comes from local law enforcement – the numbers are preliminary, not all communities submitted data, and the submitted data usually has some initial errors – so these statistics may not precisely capture the size of the recent declines in crime. But these statistics and other data sources make it clear crime has indeed declined to some extent nationally, though not everywhere.
Crime data expert Jeff Asher, co-founder of the firm AH Datalytics, said that if the final 2023 figures show a decline in murder of at least 10% from 2022, this would be the fastest US decline “ever recorded.” And he noted that both the preliminary FBI-published data from the first quarter of 2024 and also “crime data collected from several independent sources point to an even larger decline in property and violent crime, including a substantially larger drop in murder, so far this year compared to 2023, though there is still time left in the year for those trends to change.”

Trump blames Biden administration for ‘greatest invasion in history’
During his RNC speech, former President Donald Trump claimed that the Biden administration has done nothing to curb illegal immigration to the US.
“The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country—they are coming in from every corner of the earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, and the Middle East,” Trump said, “they’re coming at levels we’ve never seen before it is an invasion indeed and this administration does nothing to stop them.”
Facts First:  Trump’s claim that the Biden administration is doing “nothing” is incorrect. Illegal crossings at the US border dropped in June and the Biden administration has imposed significant restrictions on asylum along with other measures to curb illegal immigration. 
 
Arrests along the US southern border dropped 29% in June, according to new data released by US Customs and Border Protection, following the Biden administration’s order severely limiting asylum-seeker crossings.“Recent border security measures have made a meaningful impact on our ability to impose consequences for those crossing unlawfully,” CBP Acting Commissioner Troy A. Miller previously said in a statement.
Last month, the Biden administration invoked an authority to shut off access to asylum for migrants who cross the US-Mexico border illegally, a significant attempt to address one of the president’s biggest political vulnerabilities. It was the administration’s most dramatic move on the US southern border, using the same authority former President Donald Trump tried to use in office.

Trump makes claims about grocery prices rising under Biden
Former President Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that groceries are up 57% during the Biden administration.
Facts First: Trump’s claims of grocery prices being up 57% are false and could use some context.
Inflation’s rapid ascent, which began in early 2021, was the result of a confluence of factors, including effects from the Covid-19 pandemic such as snarled supply chains and geopolitical fallout (specifically Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) that triggered food and energy price shocks. Heightened consumer demand boosted in part by fiscal stimulus from both the Trump and Biden administrations also led to higher prices, as did the post-pandemic imbalance in the labor market.
Inflation peaked at 9.1% in June 2022, hitting a 41-year high, and has slowed since (the Consumer Price Index was at 3% as of June 2024). However, it remains elevated from historical levels. Three-plus years of pervasive and prolonged inflation has weighed considerably on Americans, especially lower-income households trying to afford the necessities (food, shelter and transportation).
Food prices, specifically grocery prices, did outpace overall inflation for much of 2022 and 2023, driven higher by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Still, grocery prices didn’t rise to the extent that Trump claims. Annual food and grocery inflation peaked at 11.4% and 13.5% in August 2022, respectively. Since Biden took office, the CPI “food at home” index is up 21%, which is higher than its 9% typical rise in recent history over a 54-month period, but it’s not 57%.
Through the 12 months that ended in June, overall food and grocery prices were up just 2.2% and 1.1%, respectively.
Certain food categories saw much greater inflation: Notably, egg prices were up 70% annually in January 2023. However, the underlying cause of that sharp increase was a highly contagious, deadly avian flu. Food prices are highly volatile and can be influenced by a variety of factors, especially disease, extreme weather events, global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and once-in-a-lifetime pandemics.

Trump’s misleading claim about energy independence
Former President Donald Trump claimed that the US was “energy independent” during his presidency but that this changed under President Joe Biden.
Facts First: This is misleading. “Energy independent” is a political phrase, not a literal phrase, that can be defined in various ways – and, under Biden, the US has continued to satisfy the same definitions it satisfied under Trump. US production of oil and gas have set records under Biden.
“Energy independent” doesn’t mean the US uses no foreign energy or that it is untethered from global energy markets; this wasn’t the case under Trump and still isn’t under Biden. Experts in energy policy tend to scoff at the term “energy independence,” with three experts telling CNN in 2022 that it is a “horrible term,” “ridiculous term” and “stupid term,” respectively.
But if the term is defined as the US exporting more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported, that has happened in every year under Biden after happening under Trump in 2020 for the first time in decades. (In fact, the US surplus in petroleum trade has grown under Biden as US crude oil production and exports have hit new highs) And if the term is defined as the US producing more energy than it consumes, that has also continued to happen under Biden after happening under Trump in 2019for the first time in decades.
You can read here about the various economic reasons the US has imported foreign energy under both Trump and Biden despite its so-called “energy independence.”

Trump’s false claim on his tax cuts
Former President Donald Trump once again claimed that he signed the largest tax cuts in history during his administration.
“We got credit for the war, and defeating ISIS, and so many things. The great economy, the biggest tax cuts ever, the biggest regulation cuts ever, the creation of Space Force, the rebuilding of our military. We did so much,” Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention on Thursday.
Facts First: This is false. Analyses have found that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars.
The act made numerous permanent and temporary changes to the tax code, including reducing both corporate and individual income tax rates.
In a report released in June, the federal government’s nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the size of past tax cuts enacted between 1981 and 2023. It found that two other tax cut bills have been bigger – former President Ronald Reagan’s 1981 package and legislation signed by former President Barack Obama that extended earlier tax cuts enacted during former President George W. Bush’s administration.
The CBO measured the sizes of tax cuts by looking at the revenue effects of the bills as a percentage of gross domestic product – in other words, how much federal revenue the bill cuts as a portion of the economy – over five years. Reagan’s 1981 tax cut and Obama’s 2012 tax cut extension were 3.5% and 1.7% of GDP, respectively.
Trump’s 2017 tax cut, by contrast, was estimated to be about 1% of GDP.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit, found in 2017 that the framework for the Trump tax cuts would be the fourth largest since 1940 in inflation-adjusted dollars and the eighth largest since 1918 as a percentage of gross domestic product.

Trump’s false claim US had ‘no’ inflation during his presidency
Former President Donald Trump said Thursday that inflation did not exist during his presidency – drawing a contrast between his administration and that of President Joe Biden, whose early years in office were plagued by decades-high inflation.
“We had no inflation,” Trump said in his speech at the Republican National Convention.
Facts First: Trump’s comment is false. Inflation was low, but not nothing.
The Consumer Price Index, a common measure of inflation, rose about 8% during Trump’s four years in office. In January 2021, his final partial month in office, it increased 1.4% from a year earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump repeats frequent claim about oil drilling and gas prices
As he has done repeatedly on the campaign trail, Former President Donald Trump claimed Thursday that under a new Trump administration, the United States would “drill, baby, drill, … by doing that, we will lead to a large-scale decline in prices.”
Facts First: Trump’s frequent campaign claim that the US can lower gas prices by producing more domestic oil is misleading.
Under President Joe Biden, US oil production has reached a new record this year, even surpassing output under Trump’s administration. The Energy Information Administration expects crude oil production to hit successive records this year and next, powered by an oil boom in the Permian Basin. As CNN has reported, the US currently produces more oil than any other country on the planet, at about half a million barrels per day more than the prior annual record set in 2019.
Prices at the pump in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market and the US cannot be truly energy independent when it comes to gas prices, energy experts have told CNN. Oil is a global commodity; the global price of oil determines US gas prices and it’s simply impossible to separate that price from shifting global dynamics like Russia’s war on Ukraine or OPEC’s recent decisions to cut oil production.
“Whether we’re drill baby, drilling has more to do with what the price of crude oil is, how healthy is the economy,” Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, and a former George W. Bush White House official, told CNN recently. “These things are outside of a president’s direct control.” There’s also the fact that the US consumes a different kind of oil than it produces, McNally told CNN last year. McNally compared the light crude the US produces to champagne, and the heavy crude it imports to coffee. US oil refineries are specifically built to separate out the “heavy and gunky” crude we consume, McNally said.

Pompeo falsely claims Biden ‘won’t even talk about’ American hostages in Gaza
Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed on Thursday that President Joe Biden “won’t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held” in Gaza.
“And now of course a second war in Gaza. President Biden won’t even talk about the fact that Americans are still being held there by the Iranian regime,” Pompeo said.
Facts First: The claim that Biden “won’t even talk about” the American hostages in Gaza is false. Biden has spoken about the Americans held in Gaza in the wake of Hamas’ invasion of Israel several times since October.
Recently on May 31, speaking about a proposed deal for Israel and Hamas, Biden said American hostages would be released in the first phase of the deal: “[W]e want them home.”
On October 25, Biden said his administration was working “around the clock together with our partners in the region to secure the release of hostages including American citizens … left behind.”
On November 26, he spoke extensively about the release of an Israeli American little girl who was held hostage and said he was pressing for more Americans to be released, adding, “we will not stop working until every hostage is returned to their loved ones.”
Most recently, at the NATO Summit in DC last week, Biden talked about hostages broadly, saying the US “has been working to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, to bring the hostages home, to create a path for peace and stability in the Middle East.”

Trump biographical video includes false and misleading claims
The Republican National Convention played a biographical video about former President Donald Trump before Trump began his own speech. The video included false and misleading claims.
The Trump tax cuts
The video featured a narrator making a claim that Trump himself frequently utters. The narrator said, “The Trump tax cuts: largest in America’s history.”
This is false. Analyses have found that Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was not the largest in history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or inflation-adjusted dollars. You can read a detailed fact check here.
Global conflict under Trump
The video’s narrator also delivered a version of another claim Trump has made repeatedly, saying Trump’s “strength and resolve” produced “a stable world at peace.”
This claim about world peace under Trump is false, too. There were dozens of unresolved wars and armed conflicts when Trump left office in early 2021.
US troops were still deployed in combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Somalia continued, as did the war in Ethiopia’s Tigray region; the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was also ongoing, as were the conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Iran; Islamist insurgents continued their fight in Africa’s Sahel region; there was major violence in Mexico’s long-running drug wars; fighting continued between Ukraine and pro-Russian forces in Ukraine’s Donbas region; and there were lots of other unresolved wars and conflicts around the world.
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which tracks armed conflict in countries around the world, said in a June email that it estimates there were active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2020 and again active armed conflicts in 51 international states in 2021.
Americans’ incomes
While attacking President Joe Biden’s handling of the economy, the video featured on-screen text that said, “U.S. incomes fall for third straight year,” attributing those words to a Wall Street Journal article in 2023. An image of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was shown on screen at the same time.
This combination of words and images is misleading. The video didn’t acknowledge that the first of the three straight years in which the Wall Street Journal article reported that inflation-adjusted median household income went down was 2020, when Trump was president. (The Covid-19 pandemic played a major role in the decline.)
Real median household income fell from $78,250 in 2019 to $76,660 in 2020 (all under Trump), then edged down to $76,330 in 2021 (mostly under Biden) and fell more substantially to $74,580 in 2022 (all under Biden). Figures for 2023 and 2024-to-date are not available.

Eric Trump’s false claims about the economy and US global standing in 2016
Eric Trump told the crowd at the RNC Thursday that the “economy was struggling, jobs were scarce” and the US had poor standing on the global stage when his father was elected president in 2016.
Facts First: Eric Trump’s claims are false. When Donald Trump took office in 2017, he inherited a strong economy, including a robust labor market, and a nation that was viewed favorably on the global stage.
In 2016, the US added an average of nearly 194,000 jobs per month, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. In the two years before, those average gains were even higher: 226,000 in 2015 and nearly 250,000 in 2014.
Job gains remained above historical averages in 2017 through 2019, with 177,000 jobs added on average per month.
Eric Trump’s claims that jobs were scarce in 2016 were not accurate. In fact, the US labor market experienced its longest expansion on record starting in 2010 and continuing until March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic crippled global economies, including that of the US.
In addition to inheriting a labor market in good shape, the economy was growing when Trump took office. Real gross domestic product – the widest measure of economic activity – typically grows between 2% and 3%, and it averaged 2.4% between 2014-2016 and then nearly 2.7% during the first three years of Trump’s presidency, according to Bureau of Economic Analysis data.
Also, the US was well regarded internationally when Barack Obama left office, and those sentiments plunged at the beginning of Trump’s presidency, according to the spring 2017 Global Attitudes Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center.

Pompeo’s claim about the southern border under Trump
Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed at the Republican National Convention Thursday that the US-Mexico border was “closed” during Donald Trump’s presidency.
Facts First: Pompeo’s claim is false.
While Trump tightened the border during his tenure, illegal crossings into the US from Mexico still numbered in the tens of thousands each month leading up to when he left office. At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Trump administration limited non-essential travel on the US-Mexico border and prohibited migrants from crossing it in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus. President Joe Biden later extended the restrictions.
The former president’s biggest effort to “close” the border was met with resistance by federal courts, and the Supreme Court later gave Biden the green light to end the controversial “Remain in Mexico” policy.

Trump makes false claims about election fraud in RNC video
For the fourth straight night, the Republican National Convention played a video in which former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to use “every appropriate tool available to beat the Democrats,” including voting by mail. Trump relentlessly disparaged mail-in voting during the 2020 election, falsely claiming it was rife with fraud, and he has continued to sharply criticize it during the current campaign
But Trump’s comments in the convention video also included some of his regular false claims about elections. After claiming he would “once and for all secure our elections” as president, Trump again insinuated the 2020 election was not secure, saying, “We never want what happened in 2020 to happen again.” And he said, “Keep your eyes open, because these people want to cheat and they do cheat, and frankly, it’s the only thing they do well.”
Facts First: Trump’s claims are nonsense – slightly vaguer versions of his usual lies that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen and that Democrats are serial election cheaters. The 2020 election was highly secure; Trump lost fair and square to Joe Biden by an Electoral College margin of 306 to 232; there is no evidence of voter fraud even close to widespread enough to have changed the outcome in any state; and there is no basis for claiming that election cheating is the only thing at which Trump’s opponents excel.
The Trump administration’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a post-election November 2020 statement: “The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.”

“We’d begun on an honorable exit from Afghanistan, and not a single Chinese spy balloon flew across the United States of America,” Pompeo said.
Facts First: The claim that there were no spy balloons under Trump is false.
Three suspected Chinese spy balloons transited over the continental US during the Trump administration, but they were not discovered until after President Joe Biden took office. Gen. Glen VanHerck, then commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said in 2023 that a “domain awareness gap” allowed the balloons to travel undetected.

Linda McMahon’s misleading claim on tariffs
Linda McMahon, who served in the Trump administration as the Small Business Administrator, suggested at the Republican National Convention Thursday that China paid the tariffs that the former president put on roughly $300 billion of Chinese-made goods. “Instead of taxing American companies, Donald Trump put tariffs on China that raised billions of dollars and protected American industries,” she said.
Facts First: This characterization of Trump’s tariffs is misleading.
It’s true that Trump’s tariffs on China raised billions of dollars for the US government, but the duties were paid by US companies – not China.
Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission (USITC), has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
Once an importing company pays the tariff, it can decide to eat the cost or pass all or some of it to the buyer of its goods – whether that’s a retailer or a consumer.
Many economists agree that tariffs act as a tax on American consumers.
“A tariff is just a form of a tax,” Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the conservative-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN earlier this year.
Tariffs can benefit some companies by raising the prices of competing foreign-made goods, but the duties can hurt other companies by raising component parts they need to manufacture.
For example, Trump’s tariffs were imposed, in part, to boost the US manufacturing sector – but that industry lost jobs.
Federal Reserve economists found a net decrease in manufacturing employment due to the tariffs in 2019. That’s mostly because goods became more expensive to US consumers. Plus, retaliatory tariffs put on American-made goods made other US manufacturers less competitive when selling abroad.

RNC video featuring Reagan’s voice misleadingly twists magazine article
A video played on the final night of the Republican National Convention tried to attack President Joe Biden by featuring quotes from then-candidate Ronald Reagan’s famous rhetorical questions about the President Jimmy Carter era at a presidential debate against Carter in 1980.
At one point, the video featured Reagan’s voice asking if, compared to four years ago, “Is America as respected throughout the world as it was?” On-screen text answered the question with the words “allies no longer trust the United States,” attributing them to a September 2021 article in Foreign Affairs magazine.
Facts First: This quote is misleading. The article in Foreign Affairs didn’t actually declare that allies no longer trust the United States. Rather, the article noted that “critics of President Joe Biden” make the “claim” that allies no longer trust the US after Biden’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan – but the article then went on to argue that “these concerns about credibility are overblown.”
The convention video also featured Reagan’s voice asking, “Is there more or less unemployment in the country than there was four years ago?” But if you go back precisely four years from the most recent unemployment rate, the answer is: less unemployment. The current unemployment rate is 4.1% for June 2024; four years prior, in June 2020, the unemployment rate was 11.0% amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
There is a reasonable basis for this part of the video, though, if you interpret “four years ago” more broadly to refer to any time in 2020. Before the pandemic, in the first two months of 2020, the unemployment rates were 3.6% and 3.5%.

 — 
Donald Trump will be America’s 47th president, CNN projected Wednesday, after mounting the most momentous comeback in political history that will hand him massive, disruptive power at home and will send shockwaves around the world.
Four years after leaving Washington as a pariah, following his attempt to overturn the 2020 election to stay in office, Trump’s victory defied two assassination attempts, two presidential impeachments, his criminal conviction and many other criminal charges.
Trump vowed at his Mar-a-Lago resort early Wednesday to “heal” the nation, to fix its borders and to deliver a strong and prosperous economy after millions of his voters turned to him amid frustration over high prices for food and housing and embraced his plans for a crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
“I want to thank the American people for the extraordinary honor of being elected your 47th president and your 45th president,” said Trump, only the second president to win a nonconsecutive term. “This will truly be the golden age of America.”

Where Harris’ campaign went wrong
CNN projected Trump’s victory after the state of Wisconsin put him over the top and he secured the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. His win ended the Democrats’ desperate attempt to thwart his return to power, which saw Vice President Kamala Harris hurriedly elevated to the party nomination after already unpopular President Joe Biden’s disastrous performance at the CNN debate against Trump in June.
The former president outpaced his own performance in a losing cause four years ago, putting the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania back into the GOP column and retaining North Carolina for his party – all of which Democrats had targeted as part of the vice president’s path to the White House.
Trump campaigned on searing authoritarian-style rhetoric and false claims that the nation’s towns and cities were under “occupation” from foreign criminals and gangs. But he also tapped into a palpable thirst for change among Americans still feeling the painful aftereffects of a now-cooled run of high inflation. And he warned that only he could stop a slide to World War III as foreign crises rage.
He has promised to create the greatest economy in the world and to make life more affordable for working Americans who form the populist base of the Republican Party that he transformed. Trump’s supporters see him as a unique figure whose blunt, sometimes vulgar and often racially suggestive rhetoric reveals him as a scourge of political correctness. But the spectacle of the final days of the campaign being dominated by debate over whether Trump is a “fascist” reflects the fresh challenges he’s likely to pose to democratic guarantees and presidential decorum in the years ahead and the dread of at least half the electorate who voted for Harris that he plans to establish authoritarian-style rule.

Trump’s victory is also certain to lead to the dismissal of special counsel Jack Smith and will mean that the president-elect paid no electoral price for his attempt to overturn the result of the 2020 election, which culminated in his supporters’ mob attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
After years highlighting Biden’s age, Trump, at 78, is now the oldest man to be elected president ,and his every act and utterance as commander in chief is likely to be scrutinized for signs of age-related slowing down or cognitive issues.
Given the extreme nature of his campaign, his election may also augur a period of national and international turmoil. Trump has vowed to use his second term to seek “retribution” against his political adversaries and mused aloud about using the military against “the enemy from within.” Overseas, US allies are bracing for the return of the wild unpredictability in US foreign policy that Trump whipped up in his first term. There are also concerns about his willingness to enforce NATO’s bedrock principle of mutual defense.

But the billionaire real estate tycoon and former reality star’s win, based on a peerless grip on the GOP, also undeniably turns Trump into one of the most significant political figures in the history of the United States. It underlines that his victory in 2016 was not an aberration but heralded a major realignment in domestic politics and the US’ role in the world. It also means that Biden’s legacy will no longer be defined by his success in ejecting Trump from power in 2020 but by his hubris in seeking a second term that would have ended when he was 86, which opened the door to his rival again.

Trump’s second term will look nothing like his first
And Trump’s success means that he has for the second time defied the aspirations of millions of Americans for a female president, since his vanquishing of Harris follows his 2016 defeat of Hillary Clinton, again preventing the shattering of what she called “the highest, hardest glass ceiling” in US politics.
Trump’s false claims that he was illegally ejected from power in 2020 formed the foundation of his return four years later, since millions of Americans bought into his alternative reality. The ex-president’s defiance – and his capacity to weaponize charges against him – was best illustrated by the way he seized on his mug shot, taken in a Georgia jail after he was indicted over election interference in the state. He turned the photo into a political rallying call for a primary campaign that previously lacked juice, using subsequent legal woes – including a criminal conviction in Manhattan in a hush money case – to keep his base energized by claiming he was being indicted for them. His sense of indestructibility – and the almost divine purpose felt by many of his supporters – was reinforced when he narrowly escaped a would-be assassin’s bullet at a rally in Pennsylvania, and rose, with his ear bloodied and his fist in the air, and told his supporters to “fight, fight, fight.”

The promises that Trump made on the campaign trail leave many Americans braced for one of the most disruptive and divisive periods in the country’s modern memory. Trump has promised to immediately launch the biggest deportation operation in history on Day 1 – targeting undocumented immigrants and legal Haitian refugees whom he falsely accused of eating the pets of Ohio residents. The president-elect has also pledged a fundamental overhaul of the US economic system and plans to introduce sweeping tariffs on foreign imports – with especially punitive hikes on Chinese goods – that will cause global shockwaves.
Republicans have already won back the Senate, according to CNN’s projection, meaning that the president-elect will have huge latitude to complete his bid to transform the judiciary to ensure conservative legal dominance continues for decades. The race for the House of Representatives is still in the balance, but if Republicans can retain their narrow majority, Trump will face few challenges to his rule in Washington.
An unfettered presidency?
Trump and his supporters have made clear that they believe his most authentic instincts were thwarted in his first term by establishment figures in Washington. He and his loyalists have therefore proposed plans that could gut the government’s administrative departments and replace civil servants with political loyalists who will carry out his most draconian political desires. Trump has also vowed to sweep away the top layers of personnel at the Justice Department and in the intelligence agencies that he considers biased against him.

Here’s what Trump is proposing for the economy
His plans will almost certainly cause a showdown over the extent of presidential powers between the White House and the courts. And any efforts to use the instruments of government to push his own personal and political agendas and to punish his enemies could severely test the rule of law. But Trump has made no secret that he plans to fully exploit this summer’s Supreme Court ruling that granted commanders in chief substantial immunity for White House official acts and bolstered his already questionable claims that the president enjoys unchecked power.
Trump’s return to power is also certain to end the federal prosecutions that resulted from his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump’s new attorney general will be able to end the case being brought by Smith on election interference and his appeal to revive a trial over Trump’s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The status of a state prosecution in Georgia over Trump’s bid to overturn Biden’s victory there is more uncertain but is likely to result in a legal tussle over the capacity of a state to put a sitting president on trial. Trump has, meanwhile, made clear that he is open to pardoning supporters convicted and sent to prison for their role in the Capitol insurrection.

Trump’s victory could mean US withdraws support for Ukraine in war with Russia
Abroad, Trump is likely to again turn the United States into the one of the world’s greatest sources of unpredictability. A mercurial foreign policy that mirrors his volcanic character is expected to further erode Washington’s position as the head of a rules-based, Western democratic world order. He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine shortly after taking power. His affinity for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he referred to as a “genius” on the campaign trail, risks a resolution that validates the Kremlin’s illegal and bloody assault on a sovereign democratic nation. Such a strategy would raise questions about America’s potential appeasement of foreign autocrats and its traditional support for upholding the territorial integrity of its allies in Europe and the Pacific, including NATO partners and Taiwan.
The president-elect has not wavered in his view that American allies have been freeloading off US security guarantees for decades, and he is likely to put intense pressure on them to do more to ensure their own means of defense. Some experts credit him with forcing NATO nations into bolstering their own military capacity in his first term. And his victory is likely to be welcomed by Israel, as it pursues its wars against Hamas in Gaza and against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and in some Gulf states that agreed with Trump’s extreme hardline stance against Iran in his first term. Trump’s supporters believe that he will fix what they see as America’s weakness abroad, especially after the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan on Biden’s watch.
A new test for a rattled national psyche
Trump, if he completes his four-year second term, will become the oldest sitting president in history, a milestone that will be rich in irony since his relentless attacks on Biden’s age and mental faculties paved the way for his successor’s exit from the political stage.
During the campaign, Trump’s own mental lapses and unpredictable behavior raised speculation about his health and cognition – a theme that is likely to last throughout his second presidency. And the former president’s undimmed habit of inserting himself into every cultural and political debate and incessant zeal for igniting clashes with his political and personal adversaries promise another test for the national psyche.
Trump will be accompanied into the White House by Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio senator who emerged as a potential heir to Trumpism with his vehement defenses of his new boss on the campaign trail. Trump’s first vice president, Mike Pence, is now persona non grata in the Republican Party after he refused Trump’s demands to thwart the Constitution to overturn the result of the 2020 election during the certification process.

74,2024 Elections,2024,11,"Harris concedes the election, but not ‘the fight that fueled this campaign’",Betsy Klein,"Washington
CNN
 — 
Vice President Kamala Harris offered an uplifting, positive charge to her supporters as she conceded the 2024 presidential election, acknowledging the stinging loss while committing to a peaceful transfer of power and vowing to “fight” in a much different way than a defeated presidential candidate promised four years ago.
“Earlier today, I spoke with President-elect (Donald) Trump and congratulated him on his victory. I also told him that we will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,” she said in remarks at Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, DC.
In making the remarks, Harris did something her opponent refused to do in the aftermath of the 2020 election: Accept its results.
“A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results. … At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say: While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign,” she said.
One hundred and eight days after her campaign began, the self-described “joyful warrior” spoke about her loss in determined terms as she sought to reassure the American people.
“I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it. But we must accept the results of this election,” she said.
Closing a chapter in the history books after a tense campaign, the vice president offered a call to supporters to “roll up our sleeves” in response to the election results.

“Do not despair. This is not a time to throw up our hands. This is a time to roll up our sleeves. This is a time to organize, to mobilize, and to stay engaged for the sake of freedom and justice and the future that we all know we can build together,” she said in her 12-minute remarks.
She vowed to wage that fight “in the voting booth, in the courts, and in the public square,” as well as in “quieter ways: By treating one another with kindness and respect … by always using our strength to lift people up.”
She also sent messages to her more youthful supporters.
“To the young people who are watching, it is okay to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it’s going to be OK. On the campaign, I would often say, ‘When we fight, we win.’ But here’s the thing, here’s the thing, sometimes the fight takes a while. That doesn’t mean we won’t win. That doesn’t mean we won’t win,” she said.
“The important thing is don’t ever give up. Don’t ever give up. Don’t ever stop trying to make the world a better place,” she continued. “You have the capacity to do extraordinary good in the world.”
With the glass ceiling still intact, Harris did not directly address the nation’s failure to reach the historic, barrier-breaking outcome of a female president for the second time, something she largely avoiding highlighting on the campaign trail, rather letting surrogates do the talking for her.
But she offered a nod to the moment: “Don’t you ever listen when anyone tells you something is impossible because it has never been done before.”
The speech marked a conclusion to a historic and tumultuous election season that included President Joe Biden’s decision to step aside following a catastrophic debate performance. His running mate quickly consolidated the party’s support, ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket.
Harris wore a dark suit late Wednesday afternoon and walked out to Beyoncé’s up-tempo anthem, “Freedom,” as she has throughout her time on the campaign trail, pausing for several moments as the crowd applauded her.
Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, could be seen crying, as well as multiple attendees standing in the front row before her.

Harris had gathered with close family and aides at the Naval Observatory on Tuesday evening and did not appear at her campaign’s watch party at Howard University as thousands of her supporters gathered at her alma mater to watch the results come in.
She officially conceded the race earlier Wednesday afternoon, offering her congratulations to Trump in a call that lasted only a few minutes, a person familiar said.
Harris, a senior aide said, “discussed the importance of a peaceful transfer of power and being a president for all Americans.”
In a twist of irony, Harris’ day job will soon require her to officially certify her own loss.

 — 
Donald Trump has completed a paradigm-shattering political comeback, winning the White House in an election shaped more by Americans’ dissatisfaction with the direction of the country than by Democrats’ dire warnings of the threat the 45th and soon-to-be 47th president poses to its founding principles.
In a repeat of his 2016 victory, Trump once again broke through the “blue wall.” He defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania and was leading in two more Great Lakes swing states, Michigan and Wisconsin. He also romped in the Sun Belt battlegrounds, winning Georgia and North Carolina and leading in Arizona and Nevada.
RELATED CARD
Anatomy of three Trump elections: How Americans shifted in 2024 vs. 2020 and 2016
Trump made gains with nearly every demographic group compared with his 2020 loss, CNN’s exit polls showed. And his apparent near-mirroring of the 2016 map would indicate that he paid no political price for his lies about fraud in that election, his efforts to overturn it, or the criminal charges he has faced since then.
He is now poised to return to office with a Republican Senate majority, easing his path to confirming his choices for key government posts. It’s not yet clear which party will control the House.
Democrats, meanwhile, will be forced to confront difficult questions about the direction of the party — on the issues, and on its appeal to critical segments of the electorate, particularly the Latinos whose realignment could reshape American politics.
Here are eight takeaways from the 2024 election:
Trump undoes the Biden map
Though several states are still tallying their results, Trump’s road to victory in 2024 appears to have been nearly identical to his 2016 win.
Both campaigns had long been focused on seven swing states: the “blue wall” of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.
There were no surprises — no states that unexpectedly slipped into Trump’s column, despite his musings about winning blue states like New Mexico and Virginia.
However, Trump has already claimed Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, and he leads in all seven battlegrounds. In 2020, Joe Biden had won six of those seven — losing only North Carolina to Trump.
The final count could take weeks, but Trump also holds the popular vote lead. If that edge holds, he’d be the first Republican since George W. Bush in 2004 to win the popular vote.
The ‘glass ceiling’ remains intact
Harris’ loss will once again leave disappointed the millions of women who hoped to see the history-making moment when what Hillary Clinton famously called the “glass ceiling” was shattered.
There was a significant gender split, with the majority of women backing Harris, but men supporting Trump, CNN’s exit polls showed.
The only segment of the electorate with which Harris made notable gains over Biden’s 2020 performance was with college-educated women — the voters who had propelled the party’s strong suburban performance in the 2022 midterms.

Abortion rights, the issue that fueled Democratic wins in 2022, on ballot initiatives and in special elections, proved less potent this year.
Harris performed much worse than Biden among voters who said they thought abortion should be legal in most cases — even though the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in between the two elections.
Four years ago, 26% of the electorate held that opinion, and Biden won them by 38 points. This year, 33% held that opinion, and Harris won them by just 3 points.
It’s a result that suggests the issue wasn’t the deciding factor for many of those voters — even though Democrats had succeeded in the 2022 midterms, special elections and more by highlighting the GOP’s role in ending Roe v. Wade’s national abortion rights protections.
Republicans win the Senate
Republicans won back the Senate majority that they held during Trump’s first term but lost when he was defeated in 2020.
The GOP win would have significant ramifications for a new president —easing Trump’s path to having nominees for the Cabinet and other key posts confirmed.
Democrats entered the 2024 election cycle with only one or two seats to spare (depending on which party was in the White House, and therefore held the vice president’s tie-breaking vote) — and an all-but-impossible map to defend, with three seats in deep-red states on the ballot.
Republicans won all three of those races. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s retirement effectively guaranteed Republican Jim Justice’s win there. Montana Sen. Jon Tester lost to 38-year-old former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown fell short against businessman Bernie Moreno.

Democrats hoped a long shot would materialize — crossing their fingers that Rep. Colin Allred could oust Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, or that former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell could buck Florida’s rightward trend and beat Sen. Rick Scott. Neither came close.
Three Senate races in the Great Lakes battleground states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were also neck-and-neck. Their outcome will determine the size of the GOP majority.
Republicans now face a battle to replace Mitch McConnell as the party’s leader in the chamber, after the Kentucky senator said in February he would step down from his leadership post. Texas Sen. John Cornyn and South Dakota Sen. John Thune are the two top candidates.
Democrats could find some shelter in the House
Democrats didn’t want to discuss it before the election, but they’re talking about it now.
With Harris’ loss of the presidency and with the Senate coming under GOP control, the House could become the party’s last line of defense in Washington.
With so many votes still to be counted and races to be called, it’s hard to say whether House Democrats are on a path to victory or are headed for another close defeat. Democrats have had some good news out of New York and California, which could on their own kick out enough GOP incumbents to make Hakeem Jeffries the next House speaker.
What that would mean is, simply, that Trump would be unable to pass much, if any, legislation and perhaps more importantly would find himself hamstrung as he tries to wind back Biden’s policies.

The CHIPS Act, a bipartisan law investing in memory chip manufacturing, would be on the chopping block if Republicans keep their majority, but absent that, most would assume it’s off the table. Same goes for any move to uproot the public investments doled out by the Bipartisan Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction acts, which appear safe for the time being.
Obamacare, too, would almost surely be in the clear. (Republicans couldn’t repeal it with a governing trifecta in 2017, so talk of repeal might be over anyway.) Though all of these laws – the signature achievements of the last two Democratic administrations – seem safe if Democrats get their majority, there will still be tough fights at the administration and agency levels about how they’re managed.
But on an otherwise bleak night for Democrats, a fighting chance is the best the party can ask for.
Rural voters are an even more potent force than many realized
If Trump does return to the White House, he will have rural counties across the battleground states to thank.
There will be a lot of back-and-forth over why Harris underperformed Biden in big cities and their suburbs, but the fact remains she won in those places mostly by significant margins.
RELATED ARTICLE
Here’s what Trump is proposing for the economy
Still, Trump’s margins in rural America appear to have been simply too large to overtake. It turns out that there were, in fact, more votes for the former president to mine in counties like central Pennsylvania’s Huntingdon, a short drive from the campus of Penn State University, where he’s on pace to outperform both his vote total and margin from four years ago.
Harris’s performance in corresponding strongholds was pretty much the inverse.
In Montgomery County, home to a big chunk of the Philadelphia suburbs, Harris is on pace to win about 60% of the vote. The problem for the vice president – and it’ll be something Democrats spend a lot of time chewing on – is Biden fared about 2.5 points better than that.
There was a similar dynamic on display in Michigan’s Oakland County, too, where Trump again turned out his base and, in some places, added to it, while Harris appears unlikely to match Biden’s 14-point advantage.
Small numbers in the grander scheme of an election so big, expensive and plainly complicated could seem negligible – but they add up. And on Tuesday, the math appeared to be on Trump’s side.
Democrats will do some soul searching
Well before the outcome of the presidential election came into view, one thing was crystal clear for Democrats as Tuesday night rolled on: There would be lots of finger-pointing around the party. The results were not just a disappointment at the presidential level. In parts of the country where Democrats won and expected to win, the margin was far from comfortable.
RELATED ARTICLE
Where Harris’ campaign went wrong
Even in a scenario where Trump would be able to turn out his base, Democrats thought a surge of support among women voters thanks to an emphasis on abortion rights in races across the country would keep the presidential race close.
“As we have known all along, this is a razor thin race,” wrote Harris campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon in an email at one point in the night.
But as the night dragged on, it was not nearly as narrow as Democratic polling and public polling had projected. It became clear to Democrats that they were no longer the party with an ongoing advantage among minority voters and labor unions. And they will have to think about how to win over those constituencies and where they went wrong in messaging and ground game.
“There’ll be plenty of critiques and so on,” Democratic strategist David Axelrod said on CNN – before going on to praise Harris as a candidate despite the results.
Trump makes big gains with Latino men
Trump’s campaign pushed hard to court men, and particularly men of color. CNN’s exit polls showed it paid off.
Chief among Trump’s gains compared with his performance against Biden in 2020: Latino men. Trump won that cohort by 8 points, four years after losing them by 23 points. It’s a result that showed his campaign’s efforts to court those voters paid off — and that the late focus on a comedian mocking Puerto Rico at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally didn’t cause the damage Harris’ campaign hoped it would. The gains were concentrated most heavily among Latinos under age 65.
Trump also made gains in key places among Black men, more than doubling his 2020 performance in North Carolina.

Overall, the exit polls painted a picture of an electorate displeased with the state of the nation and its leadership.
Nearly three-fourths of voters said they were dissatisfied or angry with the way things are going in the United States, CNN’s exit polls found. Trump won about three-fifths of those voters. Biden was deeply underwater, with 58% of voters saying they disapprove of his performance as president. Four in five of those voters backed Trump.
Harris slipped compared with Biden’s performance four years ago among young voters, independents, moderates and union households.
Voters who said democracy was the most important issue overwhelmingly backed Harris, but Trump won those who identified the economy as most important by nearly the same margin.
Florida and Ohio are no longer battlegrounds
Florida’s decades-long status as a presidential swing state is over.
Two years after Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis romped to a 19-percentage-point reelection victory, Trump backed it up with another double-digit GOP win.
In heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade County — traditionally a huge source of Democratic votes — the massive swing was on full display. What had been a 29-point Hillary Clinton win in 2016 was an 11-point Trump victory this year.
Florida even bucked the national trend of states of all political stripes backing abortion rights ballot measures in the two and a half years since Roe v. Wade’s reversal.
A majority of Florida voters there backed a ballot measure to legalize abortion, but it fell short of the state’s 60% threshold to win passage — meaning the state’s six-week ban remains in place.

There are deeper reasons for Democrats to despair. The party’s historic voter registration edge has all but evaporated by 2020, and now Republicans — fueled by migration to the state since the coronavirus pandemic — have the lead. The GOP has won every governor’s race since 1994, and gerrymandered districts have locked in its supermajority in both chambers of the state legislature.
As it sheds its swing-state status, Florida could be on track to become the next Texas — poised for a generation of Republican dominance built on a coalition of older, non-college-educated voters, younger Hispanic voters, conservatives migrating from other states and more.
Ohio, another traditional presidential battleground, is also now solidly in the red column. Trump was cruising to a double-digit victory there.

 — 
It was supposed to be everything short of a free ad – a panel of women not containing their excitement to welcome Kamala Harris, ready to introduce her to their committed daytime audience of exactly the type of women the vice president’s campaign always hoped were going to be critical to her base.
It was a moment that encapsulated one of the biggest challenges facing her campaign – which, in the end, proved insurmountable.
“What, if anything, would you have done something differently than President Biden during the past four years?” co-host of ABC’s “The View” Sunny Hostin asked Harris, looking to give her a set for her to spike over the net.
RELATED ARTICLE

“There is not a thing that comes to mind,” she said.
Even Harris realized she had a problem, trying to adjust a moment later by saying she would put a Republican in her Cabinet.
Aides didn’t wait until Harris was off the set to start trying to clean it up. A Democrat who had spoken with her told CNN at the time that she didn’t want to name her differences with President Joe Biden – including a higher capital gains tax rate, a bigger child tax credit and a tougher border policy – because she thought it would look disloyal to the man who had picked her as his running mate and then stepped aside for her.
The thud fell in a campaign already struggling with a listless October, which had replaced the late summer exuberance and a September debate that nearly every political observer other than Donald Trump acknowledged she crushed. As aides new to the Harris orbit exerted control, she struggled with preparation. She grew hesitant, losing some of the confidence and swagger that had defined the early weeks of her reintroduction to the country. Aides who had successfully pushed her out of her comfort zone earlier in the year felt like they were running into the kind of walls she used to put up.
CNN spoke with over a dozen senior Harris campaign aides both in the Wilmington, Delaware, campaign headquarters and on the ground in the states, as well as multiple volunteers and local elected officials, over the course of the final weeks of the race.
A country crying out for change got a candidate who, at a crucial moment as more voters were tuning in, decided to soft-pedal the change she knew she represented.
In the scope of a Democratic ticket that pulled off the biggest turnaround in approval ratings and the fastest consolidation around a new candidate in the history of modern presidential politics, this may have seemed like a minor moment. But it reflected deeper problems: some, like with the staff around her, that she might have been able to adjust; and one, with Biden, that she could never shake, with internal polls showing overwhelming majorities of voters thought the country was on the wrong track.

By the time Harris got a clearer, sharper contrast answer out on the Biden question, the situation had congealed in ways she never got past – both among voters wavering in the center who wanted to hear her rebuff the president on his handling of the economy and voters on the left who wanted to hear her more forcefully disavow Biden’s support for Israel.
But perhaps the bigger problem with Biden, top Democrats fumed in the aftermath of that fateful debate in June and then again as they watched the results turn red on Tuesday, is that he should have never been anywhere near the 2024 race. If he had stepped aside after the midterms, as some aides urged him to, the Democratic Party process could have played out in a primary campaign. Candidates’ kinks could have been worked out – or not. Almost certainly whoever emerged as the nominee would have gone into the final weeks without so many Americans complaining they didn’t know enough, as they said about Harris. Biden could have taken on a role as steward and elder statesman, rather than a guy the Harris campaign never knew quite what do with.
Late surge of optimism crashes
If the election had been two weeks ago, senior aides to Harris were admitting in recent days, the vice president probably would have lost. But they went into Tuesday feeling like she had gotten herself to a likely squeaker victory. One-on-one conversations volunteers were having as they knocked on doors seemed to be clicking. For the first time in his nine years dominating American politics, Trump’s character seemed to be breaking through as an actual weight on people who wanted to vote for him.

Leading Democrats smiled just thinking about what it would mean to beat Trump with the first female president — a woman of color, a child of two immigrants, a prosecutor, and a candidate who talked about joy and offered up her smile against the scowl that had become his most common expression. Her candidacy sparked in them the unfamiliar feeling of hope.
That sentiment evaporated by 11 p.m. on Tuesday. But for many anxious Democrats, this is just the beginning. Going into Election Day, many top Democratic operatives across the campaign and in the states told CNN different versions of the same thought: If this didn’t work – with the massive campaign they’d put together, with millions of doors knocked by volunteers who flooded into battleground states, with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney and former President Bill Clinton united under the same tent stumping hard for her, with celebrities from Bad Bunny and Arnold Schwarzenegger throwing their cultural weight behind her – what will?

“I can’t imagine, I can’t even get my mind around what it would be like if Donald Trump won, because he is telling us such dark and sinister things that he’s going to do, and I believe him,” Sen. Cory Booker told CNN after a campaign stop late Monday afternoon in Bucks County, Pennsylvania – one of the key swing districts in the crucial battleground state.
The New Jersey Democrat said he had already warned his own staff about not giving up.
“We need to get up the next morning and forge forward,” Booker said. “I told them how much I don’t like hearing people say, ‘Oh, if so-and-so wins, I’m going to go to Canada. That’s just not our history. We’ve seen really bad outcomes out of bad historical events in our country, and we’re here because of the resiliency, the toughness, the strength of our country — and people even in the worst of times dug in and tried to do the best for our country.”
Simmering internal fights and a revealing pick in Walz
Harris’ team would have gladly taken more time to introduce the vice president to the country, or to put together an operation, which, after the ticket switch in July, woke up every morning at campaign headquarters and in the states feeling behind on planning.
But by the time the campaign pulled off its multi-state simultaneous rally across battleground states Monday evening – which ended with Lady Gaga singing her song “The Edge of Glory” and adding in, “I’m an American woman on the edge” on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art – a nervous feeling of maybe having made a movement happen was spreading among Harris aides and top supporters.
Those aides were a hodgepodge. Biden hadn’t just struggled as a candidate, but had failed to attract some top talent to his campaign because a generation of up-and-coming Democrats could never get excited about him. Harris tried to graft some of her own team onto them, even overlooking tensions between them from the early days of the Biden administration with campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon and keeping her in charge.

Here’s what Trump is proposing for the economy
But some of those who had been in Wilmington for a year before Harris became the candidate bucked at their new bosses. Alumni of Barack Obama – most prominently his 2008, campaign manager David Plouffe, but also many others who moved into state operations – tried to flex a sometimes dated but often more incisive sense of how to win voters.
Along the way, multiple aides told CNN how much they were grinding on one another. But the mission to beat Trump and the short timeline to try to get there helped paper over a lot of the infighting that might have exploded in a longer campaign. It instead just raged behind the scenes as aides like Stephanie Cutter moved to exert dominance over defining how and what Harris said what she said.
And those tensions manifested from almost the start of this short campaign, in the internal wrangling over who Harris should pick as her running mate. The case for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro was strong, and not just because Harris’ brother-in-law Tony West was telling her they looked like the future of the Democratic Party together, and that the popular governor would make sure she won Pennsylvania. Right-wing media types weren’t the only ones who noticed how much Shapiro had made himself into an Obama clone, as much a Jewish guy from the Philadelphia suburbs could be: The Obama alumni suddenly rushing onto her campaign were pushing for Shapiro.
Harris liked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, though. She liked his line about Republicans being weird. She liked the way he came off as easy and unassuming. She liked the way they’d gotten along in their interview, including his very open stress that he would mess up in a debate with Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. And she liked the way Walz had been so deferential to however she would define the job for him.

In the end, Harris made a decision that simultaneously reflected her newfound confidence and her long-standing insecurity, solid with trusting her own instincts, fine with going against her family and against the Obama orbit, but also with no interest in having anyone who would possibly outshine her.
Then, as top aides kept Harris away from interviews and unscripted moments for weeks longer than many on the campaign thought made sense, Walz was necessarily kept in a box too, so that he didn’t come off more accessible than she was.
Tuesday morning, outside a canvas launch in northeast Philadelphia, Shapiro deflected a question about whether Pennsylvania — and the race — would have looked different had he been the choice.
“I think she made a great pick in Tim Walz,” he said.
Democrats try to make sense of gut punch
Biden, most Democrats were confident going into Tuesday, would have never even been in contention. The president watched the results come in from the White House, making a few calls to local winning candidates back in Delaware. Some who spoke with him as he made the decision to drop out in July briefly lingered on what might have been – maybe he could have won by keeping his numbers even in counties where he ended up outperforming Harris, or if he’d lost anyway, at least it wouldn’t have put the burden on a Black woman. He said nothing publicly.

Trump’s second term will look nothing like his first
Harris ran on positivity. She ran on inclusivity. She convinced a party full of insiders who had gone into the year ready to write her off for the 2028 Democratic nomination that they should go all in on her for 2024.
At the beginning of the night Tuesday, when victory seemed just hours away, the people who came to what was supposed to be Harris’ celebration were dancing. A Howard University graduate seemed about to walk into history in the heart of her old HBCU campus. At one point, the camera found the student body president in the crowd and she blushed as she saw herself projected on the big screen. Anticipation mounted and cheers went out with every state called for Harris.
Seconds after North Carolina was called for Trump, the audio was switched off the big screens and music blasted through the speakers to try to salvage the energy. Most kept staring silently at the numbers, trying to make sense of what had happened.

In state capitals with Democratic governors, break-glass plans that they had started to believe they would never need are getting yanked off the shelves – to protect access to abortion medications, but also to work up other protections from what they believe will be not just a stringent, but vindictive, administration. Early thoughts about who will be running and how in 2028 are starting to circulate.
That was not on the minds of the people who started streaming out of the Howard campus early Wednesday before campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond had even finished telling them that there was still counting to be done.

 — 
Republicans will win the US Senate majority, CNN projects, shifting the balance of power in Washington and putting the chamber in position to boost Donald Trump’s presidency.
With several races still to be declared, Republicans now have 52 seats in the chamber and will assume control under a yet-to-be chosen Republican leader when the new Congress convenes in January.
The Senate takeover was the first big success of the night for Republicans, and the destiny of the House of Representatives, where the GOP is trying to defend its narrow majority, remains up in the air.
The new GOP Senate will be in a position to back Trump’s agenda and to resume the ex-president’s significant reshaping of the judiciary with scores of more conservatives.
The Republican march to control started early on election night when West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice was projected to pick up the Senate seat vacated by retiring Democrat-turned-independent Sen. Joe Manchin. Democrats had stopped contesting the seat after Manchin announced he wouldn’t seek reelection.
In Ohio, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who has served in the chamber for three terms, will lose his reelection bid, CNN projects, in a state that has gone from a perennial political bellwether during his tenure to a deep red stronghold. The new Republican senator will be businessman Bernie Moreno, a vehement Trump supporter.
And early Wednesday morning, CNN projected that in Montana, Republican businessman Tim Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL, defeated three-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.
Cruz and Scott cruise to reelection
The few Democratic opportunities to mitigate their losses dwindled quickly throughout the night.
In Florida, GOP Sen. Rick Scott easily dispatched a challenge from Democratic former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, who had built her campaign partly on a backlash to the overturning of the federal right to an abortion and Florida’s six-week abortion ban. Democrats had hoped that an abortion measure on the state’s ballot could boost Democratic turnout, but that measure failed Tuesday night.
The party’s best chance to pick up a seat had been in Texas, where national party groups made late multimillion-dollar investments into trying to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz. But the two-term senator will defeat Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, CNN projects, in yet another disappointment for Democrats as they chase the mirage of making inroads in the longtime Republican state.
And in Nebraska, CNN projects that Republican Sen. Deb Fischer will defeat a stronger-than-expected challenge from independent Dan Osborn, who, along with his allies, outspent Republican forces in the state. Her loss wouldn’t necessarily have flipped the seat to the Democrats, since Osborn hadn’t said which party he’d caucus with in Washington. But with Democrats trying to stave off a GOP majority, an Osborn win would have deprived Republicans of a seat.
Outstanding races
Democrats had always faced a prohibitive path this year in defending their narrow control of the Senate, given the incumbents facing reelection are either in states Trump had carried twice before or narrowly lost in 2020.
There are several key outstanding competitive races that have not been called.
Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is running for a third term, is in a tight race with Republican Eric Hovde, in a state also critical to the presidential race.
In another blue wall state critical to Democrats’ success up and down the ballot, two national security specialists are facing off in Michigan. Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin is seeking to hold the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow. She is facing Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers, the one-time chairman of the House Intelligence Committee who left Congress in 2015.
In Pennsylvania, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is trying to hold off a challenge from Republican Dave McCormick, who lost out on Trump’s backing during the 2022 Senate primary but secured it, and the GOP nomination, this year.
The final numbers in the Senate will also have to await the result from Nevada, where first-term Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen is up against Republican Sam Brown, an Army veteran who also lost a primary two years ago for the state’s other Senate seat. And in Arizona, where Democratic-turned-independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is retiring, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego is facing Trump acolyte Kari Lake, the 2022 gubernatorial nominee who still refuses to acknowledge her defeat in that race.
There was not much to cheer for Democrats on the Senate map on Tuesday, but Democrat Angela Alsobrooks was projected to beat Maryland’s Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan, who was popular in the solidly blue state. Hogan was often critical of Trump, a stand that was challenging for him with deeply conservative Republicans in Maryland’s western districts and areas close to the eastern shore. Alsobrooks will become just the fourth Black woman elected to the Senate after Democrat Lisa Blunt Rochester, the third, was projected to win Delaware’s open Senate seat earlier in the night.

78,2024 Elections,2024,11,Trump thinks presidents have near-total power: there will be little to stop him in his second term,Stephen Collinson,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump believes presidents have almost absolute power. In his second term, there will be few political or legal restraints to check him.
The president-elect’s sweeping victory over Vice President Kamala Harris suddenly turned the theoretical notion that he will indulge his autocratic instincts into a genuine possibility.
When Trump returns to the White House in January as one of the most powerful presidents in history, he’ll be able to take advantage of his own filleting of guardrails during his first presidency, which he continued through legal maneuverings out of office.
RELATED ARTICLE
Trump’s allies are already jockeying for high-powered spots in his administration
It’s not guaranteed that just because Trump has massive power he will spurn constitutional checks and balances. His past behavior doesn’t have to predict the future. But the lesson of Trump’s business and political careers is that he seeks to obliterate all constraints.
He has, for instance, crushed opposition in the Republican Party and driven out political heretics who oppose his “Make America Great Again” creed. This will be increasingly significant since the GOP has already flipped the Senate and still hopes to complete a monopoly on Washington power by keeping the House, which CNN has not yet projected.
No other president has come into office armed with a Supreme Court ruling that grants significant immunity to presidents for official acts. The decision, a direct result of Trump’s effort to challenge his federal indictment for 2020 election meddling, is limited — but he is certain to take an expansive view of its meaning. The ruling emerged from a conservative court majority fashioned by Trump in his first term and that many legal observers now see as a rubber stamp on future power grabs.
A mandate
Perhaps most significantly, Trump can claim democratic legitimacy for what is already shaping up as the most intemperate presidency of the modern era, after increasing his vote share across multiple demographics. “Everybody knew this when they voted yesterday. So yes, the American people voted for basically this unchecked power that the president is going to have,” said former Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who alienated himself from his party by standing up to Trump following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.

How Donald Trump completed a historic political comeback
Trump tried to destroy democracy to stay in power after the 2020 election. Four years later, he presented his platform to voters and won an Electoral College majority. He may also bolster his legitimacy by becoming the first Republican president to win the popular vote since 2004.
“America has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate,” the former and future president said at his Mar-a-Lago victory party early Wednesday.
Trump has denied that he wants autocratic power, saying his claim he’d be a dictator on day one is a joke and that he is instead the savior of democracy.
Yet millions of Americans chose Trump after his extreme closing argument in which he proposed the biggest deportation operation in US history, mused about using the military against “enemies from within” and vowed to prosecute political opponents and expel Haitian refugees in Ohio who are legally in the country and whom he falsely accused of eating people’s pets.
Ignoring legal attempts to hold him to account
Trump’s willingness to wield unchecked executive power will not only be facilitated by his interpretation of the Supreme Court ruling on immunity. He has already subverted constraints on presidential authority. His two impeachments — over trying to coerce Ukraine with aid and the Capitol insurrection – didn’t rein in his impulses. And the Republicans’ refusal to convict him in the Senate showed the toothlessness of this crucial constitutional remedy when a political party has chosen to appease an extreme president in return for power.
In Trump’s first term, some Republicans sometimes hampered his agenda. The late Arizona Sen. John McCain, for instance, thwarted an attempt to overturn key provisions of the Affordable Care Act with his thumbs down vote. But Trump ally Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene warned Wednesday that dissent would not be tolerated from GOP members. “I will not let them and neither will the American people who have given us this amazing opportunity to save this country,” the Georgia Republican posted on X.

What happens to Trump’s criminal and civil cases now that he’s been reelected
Kinzinger scoffed at the idea that a GOP Congress would temper Trump. “On paper, it’s a real thing, in practice no,” the former Illinois lawmaker told CNN’s Dana Bash Wednesday. “There is no chance, 0.0% chance, that Donald Trump says something and Republicans in the House buck him anymore.”
Trump, by winning back the Oval Office, has also evaded the constraints of the law. So, in addition to having the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling in his back pocket, why would he be cowed by the possibility of future legal action against him?
Within hours of election night. Special counsel Jack Smith was already talking with the Justice Department about ending two federal prosecutions against Trump — over his efforts to subvert the 2020 election and his hoarding of classified documents — in line with Office of Legal Counsel curbs on prosecutions of sitting presidents. A state election meddling case in Georgia is now imperiled. And huge doubts also hang over the pending sentencing of Trump after a conviction in a hush money case in New York.

‘The danger is very real’
The scope for Trump to stretch historic interpretations of his executive power is immense.
“The danger is very real,” said Corey Brettschneider, professor of politics at Brown University, and author of the book “The Presidents and the People: Five leaders who Threatened Democracy and the Citizens who Fought to Defend it.” Brettschneider cited Revolutionary War hero Patrick Henry’s disquiet about the possibility that the office of the presidency was so powerful that an incumbent with authoritarian ambitions could ascend an “American throne.” While the founders modeled the presidency on the persona of George Washington, Brettschneider explained that Henry proposed this hypothetical: “What if a bad person gets in that office or even a criminal president? And his point is, you know, these supposed checks, because they assume a virtuous person, they’re pretty weak.” Now that America has a convicted felon as its president-elect — and one who has massive ambitions for his own power — that’s no longer a hypothetical.
Trump has plenty of models for his second term. He has frequently praised foreign autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping, who face no democratic accountability. He admires the rule of his friend, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has eroded institutions of accountability, including government departments, the court system and the press. “Some people don’t like him because he’s too strong. It’s good to have a strong man at the head of a country,” Trump reflected at a rally in New Hampshire in January.
Trump’s conception of the presidency was encapsulated by his statement in July 2019 that the Constitution gave him untamed power. “I have an Article II, where I have to the right to do whatever I want as president,” he said. Article II lays out the duties of the presidency — but it does not, in conventional interpretations, at least, suggest blanket executive authority.
Trump’s attitude moved then-federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to remark in a 2019 ruling, which ordered compliance by former White House counsel Don McGahn with a congressional subpoena, that “the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.”
It will take time to rein in Trump
So, are there any constraints?
The greatest inhibition to presidential overreach is the sitting president himself, who can chose to remain within bounds of accepted executive action. But self-restraint is a concept alien to Trump. This is not just a personal trait. Such conduct is endemic to his political appeal — and he was just elected by millions of voters who endorsed his promise to eviscerate a governing system that they believe has failed them. In the past, Trump has sometimes been loath to take steps that might make him politically unpopular — yet he will take office knowing he does not have to appeal to voters ever again since he’s in his second term.
The most effective clamp on Trump’s future power would be a Democratic House majority, which could challenge the new White House with the power of oversight — even if Trump has already mocked the ultimate sanction of impeachment. But with races still outstanding, Republicans are closer to the 218 seats needed for the majority than Democrats.
Then there are the courts. Activist groups are sure to lodge cases against Trump’s immigration moves, as happened over his ban on travelers from certain Muslim nations in his first term. Such maneuvers can tie up a president for months — although the scores of Trump-appointed judges and the conservative Supreme Court majority may give the administration reprieves.
Attempts to prosecute Trump’s political foes on spurious grounds, meanwhile, could theoretically see mass resignations of Justice Department staff. This is one reason why the new administration may roll out plans to sack entire echelons of the civil service to ensure total loyalty to the new president. And the former president is unlikely to make his first-term mistake of appointing officials who confront him – like former chief of staff John Kelly and former Defense Secretary Mark Esper.
Brettschneider argues in his book published this year that an authoritarian president would not present a hopeless situation for US democracy. He examines five commanders in chief who threatened democracy and shows how they spawned protest movements, citizen activism and eventually democratic victories that created restorative presidencies.
Still, such responses can’t often halt presidential acts in their commission, meaning that the fate of the country and its democracy often hinges on the president himself. The founders were “sitting there in the Constitutional Convention and looking at Washington, and they thought to themselves, ‘this is a person of virtue. That’s who they had as a model in mind,’” Brettschneider said. “When you have somebody who’s not a model of virtue, they can really wreak havoc.”

 — 
President-elect Donald Trump has promised to completely remake the US government and wield new power as president.
The ambitious promises, if enacted, would transform society. Some of his most-repeated promises on the campaign trail include:
Mass deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants
Closing the southern border and ending birthright citizenship
Unprecedented tariffs on foreign goods from all countries, but especially China
Expansive tax cuts to benefit corporations, tipped workers, seniors on Social Security, property owners in the Northeast and many others
Trillions in cuts in government spending with help from Elon Musk
Reforming the country’s health and food systems with help from vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Reversing regulations aimed at addressing climate change
Building a new missile defense shield with help from former NFL player Herschel Walker
And so much more
Now Americans will find out what was hyperbole and what was real – what is achievable and what he will be able to push through by himself, with help from Congress and without interference by the courts.
His pledge to end Russia’s war on Ukraine “in 24 hours,” for example, seems overwrought, to say the last.
His pledge for a mass deportation effort, on the other hand, is very serious. It seems to be backed up by some clear planning but there’s a lack of public details.
Is there a master plan?
During the campaign, Trump tried to distance himself from Project 2025, the controversial and detailed blueprint for a newly reimagined federal government published by conservatives at the Heritage Foundation in anticipation of a second Trump term.
While Trump may not want to associate with that plan, it was formulated by his allies – at least 140 people associated with Project 2025 worked in Trump’s administration, according to a review by CNN’s Steve Contorno. Certainly there is some overlap between much of what the 900-page Project 2025 proposes and what Trump has said he will do in a series of very simple “Agenda47” videos on his website laying out his plans for a second term.
In one Agenda47 video, for instance, Trump promises to have an executive order prepared to end birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants. The 14th Amendment guarantees birthright citizenship, so expect court fights if this happens.
One of the policy maestros of Protect 2025, Russell Vought – who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget during Trump’s first term – was captured on hidden camera by undercover journalists over the summer talking about an aggressive agenda he was writing to get Trump’s new administration off to an active start in its first 180 days.
On mass deportations
Trump’s most aggressive promise is the rounding up and deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants. Expect Trump to come into office with a series of executive orders already written to reinstate border policies unwound by the Biden administration.
Such is the yo-yoing of US immigration policy given that Congress has been unable to pass meaningful reform for decades. What’s not clear is how exactly Trump will go about closing the US border and whether it will include the US military, the National Guard or local law enforcement agencies.
Trump’s adviser Stephen Miller said on Fox News to expect deportations to begin the moment Trump is again president on January 20, 2025.
“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” he said.
But it’s still not clear exactly how deportations will work. Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, told CNN’s Pamela Brown on Thursday that he expects every undocumented immigrant will continue to get a hearing before he or she is deported, something that will require the hiring of a large number of additional government workers if deportations are amplified to a massive scale. The current process is lengthy.
“I agree; it’s going to be a very, very big task,” Gimenez said. “And my hope is, and I expect, that we’ll just simply follow the law.”
CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez reported there have already been discussions among Trump allies and some in the private sector to detain and deport migrants at a large scale – though any operation would come with a big price tag.
She noted that Tom Homan, who was acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term, has said a deportation effort would start with anyone accused of a crime. It’s not clear what would happen to so-called Dreamers, people brought to the US as children who have lived most of their lives here. Some of them are protected by an Obama-era program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, that Trump tried unsuccessfully to end during his first term.

Plans to ‘aggressively’ fire government workers and move agencies out of DC
At the end of his first term, Trump planned to reclassify a large portion of the federal civilian workforce to make it easier to fire federal workers. Commonly referred to as “Schedule F,” Trump’s plan was to undo long-standing protections for nonpartisan civil servants.
The Biden administration has put some roadblocks in place to ward against such reclassification, but Trump promises in an Agenda47 video to immediately begin working to reinstate it so that he can “remove rogue bureaucrats.” He says he will also “clean out all of the corrupt actors” in the national security and intelligence apparatus and “immediately” move federal agencies out of the nation’s capital.
John McEntee, who was director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office during Trump’s first administration, worked on Project 2025, building a list of Trump loyalists suitable for administration roles. He remains close to Trump, according to CNN’s report on Trump’s transition.
McEntee said recently he wasn’t involved with the policy recommendations in Project 2025, even though he said, “I agree with probably most of it.” Instead, he’s interested in “staffing the president with good people … I think he deserves that.”
What about Trump’s Cabinet?
Trump likes to associate himself and his programs with boldface names. Musk will have a role in government efficiency but probably not a Cabinet position. Kennedy says he wants to give individuals more agency to reject vaccines for their children, but perhaps that does not mean he will have a Cabinet position. Does Trump’s promise at a rally in Georgia to put Walker in charge of a missile defense program mean an official government job for the failed Senate candidate?

Trump’s plan to radically remake government with RFK Jr. and Elon Musk is coming into view
There are 26 people in President Joe Biden’s Cabinet. Some, like CIA director or US ambassador to the United Nations, can be added or subtracted depending on the administration. Only two of the 26 potential positions in a Trump Cabinet are in place. Look for Trump to continue naming top officials in the coming days.
In addition to Vice President-elect JD Vance, Trump’s first key personnel news came Thursday night when he announced Susie Wiles, his campaign manager, would become his chief of staff. She’ll be the first woman to hold the position. Trump went through four such top aides during his previous administration. The longest-serving of those, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, had warned against Trump’s election.
Trump can simply hire a chief of staff, but most Cabinet positions, like secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security, will require Senate confirmation. Trump will have a Republican majority in the Senate, which should ease the confirmation of key positions, but each of the ultimate Cabinet appointees will have a confirmation hearing before they get a vote.
Frustrated by the difficulty of getting Cabinet officials confirmed during his first administration, Trump frequently appointed people as “acting” secretaries, although those appointments can only be made on a temporary basis.
Trump’s oldest son, Donald Jr., said on Fox News that Trump will prize loyalty and look for “people who don’t think that they know better than the duly elected president of the United States.”
Taking power away from Congress
Trump won’t have the 60 votes he’ll need to shoot sweeping legislation quickly through Congress without bipartisan support in the Senate. It’s not yet clear if Republicans will hold control of the House, but any majority will be slim.
One of his big plans to challenge current governing norms that’s gotten less attention is his pledge to seize some power over government spending from Congress. In one Agenda47 video, Trump says he would try to reassert the principle of “impoundment,” by which a president can reject spending instructions from Congress and use taxpayer money in other ways.

80,2024 Elections,2024,11,"What just happened? It was the economy, stupid",David Goldman,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump’s decisive election victory was about many things: a global rejection of incumbents, a rise in the Republican electorate and a battle for the future of America’s democracy. But voters consistently and repeatedly said issue No. 1 this election was the economy.
That explains a lot about why Trump was reelected.
By several major metrics, the US economy is on fire, the envy of the rest of the world. But Americans still viewed it unfavorably, and a significant number of voters blame President Joe Biden and Trump’s opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, for failing to make enough improvements to Americans’ financial situations over the past four years. Poll after poll suggested that Americans hold largely negative views about the US economy.
That’s because economic sentiment doesn’t always match up nicely with data that shows the economy is adding jobs, consumer spending is growing and gross domestic product — the broadest measure of the economy — continues to boom. When you pay through the nose for a cup of coffee or when you can’t afford to buy a home, those data are meaningless: You feel shut out of the American Dream.
Why the US economy stings so much
Housing: America’s home prices have reached new record highs for 15 straight months. That’s great news if you own a home — and not so great if you don’t, especially with mortgage rates remaining stubbornly high, just below 7%. That’s why a record low 2.5% of homes switched owners this year, the lowest in 30 years, according to Redfin.
Rent isn’t offering much relief: About half of American renters shelled out more than 30% of their income on rent in 2023. Households that spend more than 30% of their income on rent, mortgage payments or other housing costs are considered “cost-burdened” by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The housing affordability crisis has helped exacerbate America’s wealth gap, leaving people who are forced to move or don’t own a home in a financial bind. But many people who are hardly poor are also struggling to get by, largely because of how much it costs to live in a home: A fifth of US households that earn more than $150,000 a year are living paycheck to paycheck, according to a Bank of America survey.
Prices: Inflation is back to normal. But that doesn’t mean prices are falling — they’re just not rising at the alarming level they were a couple of years ago.
Prices are roughly 20% higher now than they were when Biden took office, leaving Americans with a daily reminder of how much inflation stinks every time they go to the store. Gas prices have fallen dramatically over the past couple of years, sinking from a record average high of above $5 in 2022 to below $3 a gallon in many states now. That has helped, but not solved, the inflation problems many Americans continue to face on a daily basis.
Politics: A lot of how you feel about the economy depends on your politics. And the number of registered Republicans in America is growing.
A recent study from the Brookings Institution, released last week, found a correlation between economic sentiment and political affiliation with the party in control of the White House. When Trump took office, Republican economic sentiment surged, while Democratic sentiment cratered. The opposite happened when Biden took office.
But Republicans are three times more likely to think the economy is good when a Republican is in office than Democrats when a Democrat holds the White House — and the reverse is true, too.
No, really, the US economy is great
Still, Trump will be inheriting a strong economy — on paper, anyway.
Jobs: The biggest indicator of economic security is whether or not you have a job, and a historically high percentage of people do. Even though the unemployment rate has been ticking higher over the past year, at 4.1%, it remains at a very healthy level, rising incrementally from the lowest unemployment rate since the first moon landing.
The US economy’s job-creation machine has slowed this year — particularly in recent months. Last month, the economy added just 12,000 jobs. Still, the economy is continuing to add a monthly average of 170,000 jobs this year, which is almost exactly the number the economy added during the first three years of the Trump administration, before Covid hit (175,000 jobs per month).
Companies are still clamoring so much for workers that the number of job listings is greater than the number of American job seekers, according the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
GDP: The broadest measure of the US economy is booming. Gross domestic product grew at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 2.8% last quarter, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Wednesday. That’s a healthy pace by any measure, and it’s on par with the economic expansion during the Trump administration, when people were feeling much better about the state of the economy.

It has also made America’s economy the envy of the world: Projected US economic growth for this year remains the strongest of any of the G7 economies, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Paychecks: Workers’ paychecks aren’t booming like they were a couple years ago when inflation was truly off the rails. But they’re still growing at a 3.9% adjusted rate, according to the Depart﻿ment of Labor. That’s still a faster clip than inflation, which means the amount of money Americans have to spend is growing.
Inflation-adjusted disposable income per capita rose for the 27th straight month, according to the BEA, the longest streak on record.
Consumerism: Despite polls to the contrary, consumers are acting like the economy is great. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of America’s economy, is surging, rising 3.7% last quarter, the highest rate of growth since the first quarter of 2023, according to the BEA.
And consumer confidence is on the rise, too — it surged in October by the largest amount in any survey since March 2021. Still, it remains well below where it was before the pandemic, during Trump’s first term.

81,2024 Elections,2024,11,Trump’s return to power raises serious questions about the media’s credibility,Brian Stelter,"New York
CNN
 — 
Donald Trump’s return to power is a hinge point for the American media – in ways big, small, and to be determined. His defeat of Kamala Harris is raising questions about the media’s credibility, influence, and audience. Some of the questions might not be answerable for years.
But journalists are asking each other: What does this “red wave” election say about the information environment in the United States?
In the hours after Trump won reelection Tuesday, some of his loyalists asserted that his victory is a complete repudiation of the news media. For a time on Wednesday morning, The Federalist’s lead headline was not about Trump, it was about the “corporate media industrial complex” being “2024’s biggest loser.”
Legacy media “is officially dead,” The Daily Wire podcaster Matt Walsh wrote on X overnight. “Their ability to set the narrative has been destroyed. Trump declared war on the media in 2016. Tonight he vanquished them completely. They will never be relevant again.”
That’s wishful thinking on Walsh’s part — Tuesday’s marathon election coverage was a testament to the media’s relevance — but the point is that many Trump voters share his wish. They believe the national news media is a big part of what ails America. Not only do they distrust what they read, they often don’t read it in the first place. Can anything be done to change that?
A quote in a recent New York magazine column channeled that question. The quote, from an anonymous TV executive, was recirculated on social media Wednesday morning. “If half the country has decided that Trump is qualified to be president, that means they’re not reading any of this media, and we’ve lost this audience completely,” the executive said. “A Trump victory means mainstream media is dead in its current form. And the question is what does it look like after.”

Trump campaign denies and revokes journalists’ election night credentials after critical coverage
“Dead” is gross hyperbole, of course, but the comment reflected real concerns that many members of the media have. A severe trust deficit exists between the Trump base and big institutional media outlets. In a text message, a Trump campaign aide suggested that the press should show more humility.
That raises another question: Do major networks and publications have enough columnists and commentators who reflect the Trump majority’s views?
“Maybe we have a point,” the aide remarked. “Maybe ‘misinformation’ is a lazy word that was never applied to press coverage of Biden’s health or the border. Maybe ‘offensive’ things aren’t offensive to most.”
The mainstream media “has held less clout every four years,” Semafor’s Dave Weigel wrote Wednesday morning. “On Harris-friendly cable news, ex-Republicans broadcast their horror at who Trump was and what he’d done; in the new social media and podcasts favored by Republicans, all of that was whining disconnected from what voters really cared about.”
CNN political commentator Scott Jennings hit that point hard during the 3 a.m. hour of CNN’s election coverage. He said Trump’s win was “something of an indictment of the political information complex.”
“We have been sitting around for the last couple weeks and the story that was portrayed was not true,” Jennings said. “We were told Puerto Rico was going to change the election. Liz Cheney, Nikki Haley voters, women lying to their husbands. Before that it was Tim Walz and the camo hats. Night after night after night we were told all these things and gimmicks were going to somehow push Harris over the line. And we were just ignoring the fundamentals. Inflation; people feeling like they are barely able to tread water at best; those were the fundamentals of the election.”
Jennings added: “I think for all of us who cover elections and talk about elections and do this on a day-to-day basis, we have to figure out how to understand talk to and listen to the half of the country that rose up tonight and said, ‘We have had enough.’”
Liberal commentator Ashley Allison responded: “I think we have to listen to everybody, actually.” She said, “the people who voted for Kamala Harris are struggling too. They are feeling ignored too. A Republican’s pain is no greater or less than a Democrat’s pain.”

If history is any guide, Trump is never, ever satisfied with news coverage. He always wants a more pliant, propagandistic media. He even complains about Fox News on a regular basis, despite the network’s overwhelming support for him. Last month, he complained to Fox patriarch Rupert Murdoch about the network airing Democratic ads.
Thus, Trump’s reelection portends a new period of hostility with major media outlets that strive for impartiality as well as partisan outlets that oppose him. This raises another set of questions.
Will the Trump administration turn his words against the press into actions? Will he move to revoke licenses for TV stations, as he has suggested more than a dozen times this year? Will he limit press access to the White House, barring reporters he doesn’t like?
Further, will media outlets engage in self-censoring to appease Trump, and if so, how will readers and viewers who oppose Trump react?
On Wednesday morning, newsroom leaders and owners are reassuring employees that they will have their backs in the uncertain months to come. “Now, more than ever, we are steadfast in our mission to uphold the principles of independent journalism,” Conde Nast chief Roger Lynch wrote in a memo to staffers. “A thriving, independent press, as protected by the First Amendment, is vital to democracy and the future we all share.”

 — 
American voters have spoken, and they decided to rehire Donald Trump as president of the United States.
But he won’t take office until January 20, 2025, and there are multiple things that will happen between now and then. Throughout November, December and January, there will be a transition between the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden and the incoming Trump administration. The transition has been complicated by Trump blowing through multiple deadlines in that process, which is laid out in law.
Trump faces sentencing for his felony conviction, plus many other question marks
Before he became president-elect, Trump became a convicted felon this year. A jury in New York found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to an adult film star before the 2016 election. His sentencing in that trial is set for November 26.
But the judge, Juan Merchan, could decide to throw out the conviction as soon as November 12 because of the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling. The conviction could theoretically carry prison time, but the president-elect is not going to be given jail time. The judge could also give Trump probation or fine him.
There’s a much larger universe of court cases that could be affected by his election. Trump also faces federal prosecution for trying to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling classified data, although it’s likely that those cases will somehow be sidelined or ended.
Perhaps more complicated is the fact that Trump is liable to pay hundreds of millions in damages as a result of separate business fraud and defamation civil cases. He also faces multiple lawsuits, including from Capitol Police officers injured on January 6, 2021.
The Electoral College must vote
American voters cast ballots on and before Election Day, November 5, but that was only one step in the process. States have until December 11 to confirm their election results with what’s known as Certificates of Ascertainment.
Then, on December 17, slates of electors from the 50 states and Washington, DC, meet in their capitols to officially cast the 538 Electoral College votes.
The government must be funded
A temporary government funding bill passed before the election only lasts through December 20. Lawmakers will need to meet during what’s called the “lame-duck” session to make sure the government can stay open.
The new Congress will begin
It’s not yet clear which party will have the majority in the House of Representatives, but Republicans will take a majority in the Senate. All the new lawmakers will take the oath of office and kick off the 119th Congress on January 3.
Electoral votes will be counted
On January 6, 2025, the new House and Senate will convene in the House chamber and Vice President Kamala Harris will preside over the counting of Electoral College votes that make Trump president. No vice president since Al Gore in 2001 has had to preside over their own defeat.
Trump will be sworn in
At noon on January 20, 2025, Trump will be sworn in on the west front of the US Capitol. On January 20, 2029, a new president will succeed him.

Millions of Americans will be tuning in to CNN and other networks on election night as returns roll in. They’ll be waiting to see who wins, something CNN will determine with a series of projections.
RELATED ARTICLE
Your election questions, answered
With polls so close this year and a few hotly contested states set to determine the outcome of the presidential election, everyone should be prepared to go to bed on election night not knowing who will win the White House.
I talked to Jennifer Agiesta, CNN’s director of polling and election analytics, about how CNN approaches the job of projecting a winner. It’s a complicated and exhaustive process. Our conversation is below.
Does CNN project races or call races? What’s the difference?
AGIESTA: We project races. We don’t call them. We are telling you where we think the race will wind up based on what we see in front of us. That is a projection by any normal definition of the word.
Who is involved in making projections for CNN?
AGIESTA: There are several layers of people involved in projections for CNN.
At the start of it, we have a decision team that’s made up of people who are experts in either politics or statistics, and they’re paired together based on those areas of expertise. They are all reviewing individual states, individual races, making a recommendation on a projection that gets passed up to the decision desk supervisory team – which is two people, one of whom is a statistician, one of whom is a political person.
They review every projection that those individual teams are making, and then they pass it to me. If they’re comfortable with it, I give it a check, make sure I’m good, and then, as long as all three of those layers have gone, we’re good.
We pass it on to the control room and work with them. I answer any of their questions about why we are or are not making projections at a given moment, and then it will find its way to air or online.
What is the decision desk looking at as polls close?
AGIESTA: There are a lot of different pieces of information that go into any given projection. There’s obviously vote data. We want to see what’s been counted and what hasn’t, and our expectations of how large those votes were and how they would be distributed based on past votes.
We’re looking, as much as we can, wherever it’s available, at what types of votes we have, whether they’re absentee votes or Election Day votes, and how the balance of those things matches up with what we thought it would be before Election Day.
We’re looking at the geographic distribution of votes. Did they come from a really Democratic county or a really Republican county, or from a place that counts really fast or counts really slow?
Based on what we know about those things, all of that gets dumped into statistical models that tell us what level of confidence we can have with the estimate that it gives us. We also are looking, to some degree, at exit polls in some states and what those are saying about how voters split in a given place.
All of that kind of comes together to make the ultimate projection.
How do things progress over the course of the night?
AGIESTA: It starts off being much more exit poll focused. In states with exit polls, we have reporters out in the sample of precincts where those exit polls have been conducted who are collecting votes from those specific precincts. So we can see how the exit polls are performing in real time.

Here’s how election night will unfold hour by hour
That also is, in a lot of ways, a representative sample of at least the Election Day vote within a state, and so that gives us another marker of how things are going. Those kinds of measures will be more important earlier in the night.
We’ll then start to transition to looking at the actual votes and where things are, and the models become important for a really long time once we’re basing things entirely on what the counties are telling us about what’s counted and what types of votes those are.
Then really late in the night, that’s where the states that are super close that we’re projecting last – those are the ones where we’re looking for the math problem that you and I talked about four years ago, where it’s like, is there enough vote out there that the candidate who’s trailing could catch up? And that becomes more of an algebra problem than a modeling problem.

Is the presumption that there will be states that we can’t project on election night?
AGIESTA: I think there will be some states that we can’t project on election night just because of the nature of how they count their votes and what we know about the speed of the reporting.
It doesn’t necessarily mean that there’s anything wrong in those states, or that things have gone haywire, or anything like that. It just is the process of counting these ballots that takes time.

When polls will close in key battlegrounds – and when ballots will be counted
In Pennsylvania, they’re not allowed to process by-mail ballots until Election Day itself, so those election officials have to go through the process of opening every single envelope and unfolding the ballot and feeding it through the scanner and whatever other verification processes they go through. And all of that takes time.
So they do as much as they can during Election Day, and then when the polls close, they tend to stop and come back to what’s left of those ballots later. But it tends to be after Election Day in a place like Pennsylvania.
The same thing kind of happens in Arizona and in Nevada, where you have a lot of by-mail ballots. A lot of them returned later in the process – the “late earlies” that everybody talked about in Arizona (in 2020), they just take some time to work through and actually get them counted.
But other states are super fast, and we can probably get those projected on election night. States with a wide margin will probably be projected on election night, but close states where they have those sort of slower counts are just going to take some time.
Is there a threshold or marker you’re looking for to make a projection?
AGIESTA: What we’re looking for with our models is 99% confidence. And I believe the exact figure is 99.7% confidence from those models that we actually have the statistical backing to make any projection.
It really is knowing the full picture of what (votes are) out and what has been counted and how those things are expected to go, making sure that we really know that there’s not some wild thing out there that could totally change the trajectory of what we’ve seen so far.
Is there a different approach to projecting who will win the White House vs. who will win an individual state? One is 538 votes; the other could be many millions.
AGIESTA: Obviously we want to consider every projection we make carefully, and we don’t really have different standards for how we’re projecting these things.
Every projection that we make, we’re going to look for that same level of confidence, level of certainty before we do it, whether it’s a race for president or a race for dog catcher.
There’s a lot more attention on one of those than the other, so we will have more people involved and a bigger set of fact checks on a more important projection. There will be more people making sure, asking every possible question all the way down the line before we project anything that is of serious consequence.
What will be different this year compared with previous years?
AGIESTA: We expect to see a lot fewer mail-in ballots generally, just because we’re not in the middle of a pandemic. We saw in 2022 that the share of voters who chose to vote through mail-in ballots has dropped back to where it was before the pandemic. I think we’ll see that continue.
That doesn’t mean there won’t be any mail-in ballots. There will be a lot of them, and they still take time to count. But in a state like Georgia or North Carolina, where you had a huge number of mail-in ballots in 2020, that’s dropped back to a lower share, with most of the preelection voting happening early in person.
In North Carolina specifically, they no longer accept mail-in ballots after Election Day, even if they were postmarked by Election Day, so you won’t have that uncertainty about the number of mail-in ballots that could be out there.
I think in Pennsylvania, it’s all but two of the counties there have taken grant money that requires that they count continuously through the end. So rather than having some counties that might count during the day and then stop overnight, they’re going to be counting around the clock.
Whether they’ll be reporting around the clock is a different question, but it should get them to the end of the count faster, even if it does extend beyond Election Day itself.
CNN rates seven states as being battlegrounds. What are the early bellwethers in those states?
AGIESTA: In Georgia, we’ll start to see early in-person votes reported quickly. We’ll see mail-in ballots reported really quickly. So we’ll get a good sense of whether that batch of early votes is as Democratic as it had been in the past, or is there any shifting in the partisan balance of preelection votes versus Election Day votes.
I think we’ll see a similar dynamic in North Carolina.

Within each of those states, we’ll be looking at the margins in specific types of counties. Are the rural counties as strongly (Donald) Trump as they used to be? It’s been a pretty prominent (Kamala) Harris strategy to try to shrink the margins in those rural counties. Is that happening in those counties that count pretty quickly?
RELATED ARTICLE
What is the ‘red mirage’ or the ‘blue shift’ and will it happen this year?
At the same time, in the more urban counties in these earlier reporting states, is the turnout looking like it would in an election where a Democrat winds up winning? Or is it looking more like it did in 2016, when urban turnout was a little bit down relative to the norm?
Are the vote divides in those more urban counties similar to what they were in 2020, or do they look different this year?
Those changes year to year in different types of counties are probably where we’d be focusing our attention early on.
Within the states that happen later in the night, in Arizona, in Nevada, Michigan and, to some extent, Wisconsin, there are the key counties that I think everybody who follows elections knows at this point.
In Arizona, it’s all about Maricopa.
In Nevada, it’s Clark and Washoe, because those are where the people live.
In Wisconsin, we’ll be looking at those Milwaukee suburbs. How strong is the Democratic turnout in a place like Dane County?
What are we seeing in an area like Grand Rapids in Kent County in Michigan that’s been kind of swinging over the last few elections?
We have those places identified that are critical to watch, and we’ll see how they turn out over the course of the night.
Is there a precedent in your career for a race that’s this close heading into Election Day?
AGIESTA: I was an actual adult in 2000. That’s probably as close as it’s ever gonna be.
WOLF: But did it seem as close in 2000 heading in? I’m trying to remember.
AGIESTA: I don’t think it did. I don’t know that it was quite as close in so many places. But I mean, it ultimately came down to a few hundred votes in Florida. New Mexico was decided by a few hundred votes. New Hampshire was decided by a very small margin. The places were different, but it was pretty tight.
Conversely, could it end up being not close at all?
AGIESTA: It could. I mean, polls are wonderful tools, and obviously I think that they are wonderful measures of how people are feeling, what they’re thinking, how they are making the decisions that they ultimately will make in any given election.
But they’re not precise to the level that they would need to be to tell you that a 1-point shift is happening, or that a margin that looks like it’s going to be a tied race, who actually is up or down in that kind of race. A poll can’t tell you that. We have to wait for the votes to be counted to know.
There’s a surprise every election. What is something you’re worried about this year?
AGIESTA: (Laughs.) I’m worried about so many things. I think my biggest worry is that it could potentially take a lot longer than we expect, given the tightness of the preelection polls.
In 2020, we were able to make a final projection on the presidency on Saturday. I think the most likely scenario this year is that it’s a little bit earlier than that.
But if it comes down to a situation where we’re waiting on a state that has to go through a recount process, or we’re waiting on a tied Electoral College or something, then it stretches out into possibly December.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/politics/how-cnn-projects-elections-what-matters/index.html
84,2024 Elections,2024,11,How Donald Trump completed a historic political comeback,Steve Contorno,"West Palm Beach, Florida
CNN
 — 
Donald Trump began his political comeback when many in his own party wanted him to go away.
He announced his third White House bid days after Republicans underwhelmed in the 2022 midterm elections, a performance that prominent GOP figures laid squarely at his feet — for the candidates he supported, for lingering resentments over the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and for his unwillingness to recede from public life in the aftermath of defeat.
Surrounded at Mar-a-Lago by the close allies and aides that had yet to abandon him during his post-presidency exile, Trump assigned blame elsewhere, including the justice system that had raided his Palm Beach estate three months prior. He offered a dark assessment of the country after he left office and forecasted that before long voters would turn against those in charge.
“I have no doubt that by 2024, it will sadly be much worse, and they will see clearly what has happened and is happening to our country,” Trump said, “and the voting will be much different.”
By early Wednesday morning, Trump’s prediction had materialized. Millions of Americans, including pivotal voters in Midwest and Sun Belt battlegrounds, cast ballots that clinched Trump’s historic comeback — one that promises to reshape American politics for the foreseeable future.
Trump’s victory, years in the making, is as notable for its breadth as for its method. His campaign aimed from the outset to remake the political coalitions that have underpinned American elections for generations. Trump reached out to constituencies traditionally loyal to Democrats: union households, wage workers, and Black and Latino men.
At the same time, he courted the disillusioned — men scattered throughout America’s forgotten places who had long given up on electoral politics altogether. And his allies exploited rifts between Democrats and their base of support. A Republican-tied super PAC, for example, aired ads on Detroit radio urging the area’s Arab voters to support Green Party candidate Jill Stein over the Democratic ticket due to the Mideast conflict.
Simultaneously, the Republican Jewish Coalition spent $15 million targeting Jewish voters anxious over the administration’s support for Israel and the left’s embrace of pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses.
Preliminary data suggests his team achieved even more than they anticipated. Trump’s apparent gains among younger voters surpassed the rosiest of projections. When all the votes are counted, Trump appears likely to become the first Republican since 2004 to win the popular vote as well as the Electoral College.
“The most important thing and what should inform what happens with the party moving forward: He built a broad and diverse coalition,” senior adviser Brian Hughes said Wednesday morning just as Trump took the stage to delivery victory remarks. “And now the exit polling reflects it.”
A stable group of campaign aides and a consistent message
People within and close to Trump’s political operation credit his victory to a host of factors, not the least of which was a campaign that, from the start, appeared far more sophisticated and disciplined than its two predecessors. They argued that the campaign leadership, led by Florida guru Susie Wiles and veteran Republican operative Chris LaCivita, helped instill a sense of control over the candidate that extended to the Republican Party and helped counteract Trump’s proclivity to get in his own way.
The two managed to serve as the former president’s campaign heads for the entire cycle — unheard of in Trump world — and kept the fringe influences within his orbit at bay.
“Susie and Chris have held it together,” one longtime Trump confidant told CNN.
But the scale of Trump’s win points to forces at work beyond any single campaign maneuver or specific moment in a race marked by many unprecedented events, including multiple attempts on the Republican’s life and the abrupt exit of Democratic President Joe Biden.
Rather, the outcome reflects the very scenario Trump foreshadowed two years earlier: An American public beset by inflation, frustrated by years of immigration mismanagement and ultimately prepared to pivot away from the party in power — even if it meant putting the executive branch back in the hands of an unpopular, twice-impeached ex-president whose failed attempts to remain in office ended in a bloody riot in the nation’s capital.
For Vice President Kamala Harris, saddled with the baggage of an unpopular incumbent and sour views about the US economy, the race proved challenging, and her scramble to demonstrate her readiness for the role Trump once held ultimately fell short for enough Americans to tip the scales.

Skeptics in and outside of the GOP proved wrong
Yet, skeptics within the GOP remained and cast doubt as to whether enough Americans would ever again turn to Trump to lead the country.
A lineup of former allies, including Trump’s first vice president, Mike Pence; ex-political protege Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis; and former ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, set out to test that case, even as the former president made clear he intended to seek the Oval Office once more. For a time, it appeared there was an opening for those candidates to pull the GOP from Trump’s vise grip.
Trump enraged his close allies by dining with a known neo-Nazi in the days following the launch of his presidential campaign, and his threat shortly after to terminate the Constitution sent his political team — and his public support — spiraling. The episode marked a low point, Wiles would later tell The Atlantic, leading to an ominously dark Christmas in Palm Beach. Wiles recalled Trump asked her during that stretch, “Do you think I would win Florida?”
Then came a series of state and federal indictments targeting Trump’s businesses, his failed attempts to maintain power and droves of White House documents he allegedly took with him to Mar-a-Lago. The response from Republican voters was almost instantaneous. With each new case came a wave of donations and renewed support from the politicians who had left his side.
His Republican rivals, already straining to criticize Trump without alienating the GOP faithful, were stuck. All through 2023, Trump refused to attend a single Republican primary debate, leaving his opponents to fight among each other to establish themselves as an alternative.
Trump’s political team seized on their change in fortune, selling T-shirts with his mug shot and consolidating support throughout the country. Meanwhile, they set out to build a political machine that would pale in comparison to the disorganized and wayward operations of his first two campaigns.
The first test came in Iowa. The campaign recruited and trained around 2,000 volunteer caucus captains across the state. Each was assigned a mission: Get commitments from 10 first-time voters in the Iowa caucuses from a list of 25 prospective supporters the campaign had identified in their neighborhoods.
On January 15, Trump captured support from 51% of Iowa caucusgoers, leaving a wide chasm between him and the rest of the field. From there, Trump marched to the GOP nomination, losing only the Vermont and Washington, DC, primaries.
Still, Haley had exposed lingering discomfort with Trump among some moderate Republicans, especially suburban women who had turned against the former president almost immediately after his 2017 inauguration.
A new tactic for the general election
Trump’s team concluded early that the economy and external forces were more likely to dictate how those voters viewed their decision in 2024 than any outreach he or they could make. Instead, his operatives set out to replace their support by building a new coalition across the battleground states most likely to decide the presidential election.
He promised Libertarians a cabinet spot, and to Bitcoin enthusiasts he vowed to install a pro-crypto administration. He made repeated overtures to Michigan autoworkers. He held a rally in the Bronx geared toward Black and Latino voters. He visited deeply blue parts of the country, convinced expanding his efforts outside the traditional battleground map could put the popular vote within reach.
Along the way he dangled financial incentives to key groups: no taxes on tipped wages to service workers in Nevada; no taxes on overtime wages for blue-collar workers; no taxes on Social Security for seniors. Mostly, he sought to convince each group that the flow of migrants through the US southern border threatened their jobs, safety and way of life.
He also sat down for lengthy interviews with an emerging media ecosystem of male influencers and podcast hosts — comedians, athletes, pranksters and Joe Rogan — who his campaign believed touched men of all stripes, from the investor class to the industrial exurbs.
The strategy was piloted in part by 27-year-old Alex Bruesewitz, who convinced Trump he could reach millions of unlikely voters on these shows. Trump ran some of the campaign’s digital ideas by his son Barron, on whom he has increasingly relied for advice on connecting with younger voters, a source told CNN.
Trump started a TikTok account, despite once having threatened to shut down the Chinese social media company, and attempted to build on his outreach through viral moments, including a photo op working at McDonald’s and driving a sanitation truck on an airport tarmac in response to Biden seeming to call his supporters “garbage.”
The campaign’s intense focus on low-propensity voters, a term political operatives use for people who rarely, if ever, vote, rattled the nerves of longtime Republican operatives used to fighting for more reliable voters whose politics wavered from left to right every election cycle. Trump further alarmed the GOP faithful when his campaign helped orchestrate the ouster of Republican Party chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, threw out the party’s battleground state plans and installed loyalists atop the RNC to help execute his campaign’s vision.
The decision to take over the party came with Trump on the heels of securing the nomination after his allies raised concerns about how McDaniel was spending its money.
“It was a marketing operation for the party,” a person involved in reviewing the party’s activity and spending told CNN. “We needed to get the entire apparatus under one roof.”
Taking a risk
Wiles and Trump’s political director, James Blair, had honed this targeted approach in campaigns they ran together in Florida, including the former president’s successful 2020 operation there. Still, one person deeply involved in carrying out these plans acknowledged to CNN that if Trump lost, they would field considerable blame for their unconventional ways.
“We’re either going to be ridden out of town on a rail for this and a lot of other things,” the person said. “Or we’ll be geniuses, and it will change things for a long period of time.”
Their push relied in part on the work of outside groups, made possible by an FEC decision this year granting campaigns the ability to coordinate with outside political action committees on paid canvassing. Those groups included Turning Point Action, a group targeting younger voters run by Trump loyalist Charlie Kirk, and America PAC, a super PAC founded by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who in the final months steered his tremendous wealth and influence and his social media website X toward getting Trump reelected.
By the end of October, Musk’s super PAC had spent more than $140 million on boosting Trump, according to its disclosures with federal regulators, including more than $80 million the group categorized as spending on canvassing and field operations. The money went toward door-knockers, phone bankers and other canvassers, and included daily $1 million giveaways to registered voters in battleground states that prompted the Philadelphia district attorney to sue Musk.
In Arizona, Turning Point spent tens of millions on a get-out-the-vote program it called “Chase the Vote.” Full-time staff called “ballot chasers” were trained to build relationships with 400 to 600 specific individuals over months and ensure they voted in the presidential election. They were instructed to drive them to the polls, help them mail in a ballot and encourage early voting.
A week before the election, a person with knowledge of Turning Point’s operation told CNN that it had banked votes from more than 125,000 of the low-propensity voters it had targeted in Arizona — a margin greater than Trump’s defeat in the state four years prior.

A final vibe shift
In the final stretch of the campaign, Trump’s team grappled with uncertainty, unsure whether their months of groundwork would translate into the outcome they sought.
Mounting concerns lingered over Trump’s erratic behavior in the closing weeks — a pattern marked by chronic tardiness, a subdued energy, and lengthy, meandering speeches before thinning crowds. A particularly chaotic rally at Madison Square Garden, marred by incendiary remarks, risked reminding voters of the very conduct his advisers had carefully sought to keep out of the spotlight. A particularly offensive joke about Puerto Rico by a comedian sent Trump’s political operation into a tizzy of finger-pointing because everyone knew how hard they had worked to build support in Latino communities.
With the clock ticking down on Election Day, Trump and his allies appeared to develop last-minute jitters about their reliance on male voters. Kirk, Musk and others spent the day pleading online for men to match the turnout they had seen already. Trump himself sent out a robocall telling men to “get off that beautiful couch” and vote.
In the end, though, the concerns were unwarranted. Trump’s campaign had made substantial gains among every demographic his campaign set out to find new votes.
“They came from all quarters: Union, nonunion, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American,” Trump said in his victory remarks. “We had everybody, and it was beautiful. It was a historic realignment. Uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense.”

 — 
The winners of several elections up and down the ballot will be making history this year, CNN projects.
With CNN projecting a Donald Trump win for president, his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, is poised to be sworn in as the first millennial vice president.
Both parties are also poised to welcome a diverse group of newly elected lawmakers in Congress and in state executive offices.
Among the projected winners in US Senate races are Democrats Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, who – in addition to becoming their states’ first Black senators – will also be the first two Black women to serve simultaneously in the chamber.
In the House, CNN projects North Dakota to make history with the election of its first woman, Republican Julie Fedorchak, to the state’s at-large district. The result will leave Mississippi as the only state not to have elected a woman to the US House.

86,2024 Elections,2024,11,"Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will win reelection in Wisconsin, CNN projects",Simone Pathe,"CNN
 — 
Sen. Tammy Baldwin will win reelection in Wisconsin, CNN projects, in a victory for Senate Democrats trying to defend the so-called blue wall states despite losing them at the presidential level and having already lost their majority in the chamber.
Baldwin is projected defeat Republican Eric Hovde in a race that attracted a late flurry of attention after initially appearing less competitive than a few other states where Democrats were on defense.
Baldwin will be returning for a third term to a dramatically shifted Senate. Republicans are currently projected to control 52 seats next year, having flipped West Virginia, Ohio and Montana. CNN has not yet projected the other “blue wall” Senate races – in Pennsylvania and Michigan – as of Wednesday afternoon.
Republicans came home late to Hovde, but Democrats had worked to define him early, seizing on some of his controversial comments to paint him as a California banker who didn’t have Wisconsin voters’ best interest at heart. (The CEO of Sunwest Bank owns a home in Laguna Beach, California, but was born and raised in the Badger State.) Democrats also leaned into the issue of abortion to pick up nontraditional Democratic voters.

Republicans will flip the Senate, CNN projects, shifting balance of power in Washington
Hovde, who’s also CEO of a prominent Madison-based development company bearing his name, poured millions of dollars into his campaign and had significant outside firepower from GOP groups. But Baldwin – a well-known incumbent first elected to the Senate in 2012 after seven terms in the House – raised substantial money that also allowed her to reserve advertising time at the more favorable candidate rate.
Her campaign attacked Hovde, for example, for saying that most nursing home patients aren’t in a condition to vote, while touting her work in the Senate, including efforts to pass the PACT Act, which expands health care benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits.
The two-term incumbent had experience courting ticket-splitters – she won her previous reelection in 2018 after former President Donald Trump had carried Wisconsin two years earlier. But Hovde posed a tougher challenge than her opponent from six years ago. Baldwin made an effort to travel to rural and conservative parts of the state to try to narrow Hovde’s margins, even in places where Democrats were likely to lose. She also scored the endorsement of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, a notable get for a Democrat running statewide.
For much of the race, Hovde had a defensive posture on air responding to Democratic attacks – trying to lay out his Wisconsin roots or call out Baldwin’s spots for being “nasty.” But the GOP nominee – whose campaign underwent an early fall shake-up – also tried to nationalize the race, attempting to tie Baldwin to President Joe Biden and then Vice President Kamala Harris on inflation and the border.
And in the final stretch, Hovde and his GOP allies accused Baldwin, the first out gay senator, of a conflict of interest because her partner of six years is a financial adviser for high-end clients. The charge, which Baldwin strongly denies, lacks proof. Republicans also attacked her over transgender issues, trying to paint the senator as too liberal for the state. Baldwin took to the airwaves to say that Hovde was “lying” and that he was “not for us.”
While those GOP lines of attack may have helped Hovde consolidate the base with which he was lagging for much of the race, it wasn’t enough to win over the general electorate.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/tammy-baldwin-wisconsin-senate/index.html
87,2024 Elections,2024,11,"Democrat Elissa Slotkin will win Michigan Senate seat, CNN projects",,"CNN
 — 
Rep. Elissa Slotkin will win the competitive Michigan Senate race, CNN projects, keeping the seat in Democratic hands and making her the youngest Democratic woman elected to the Senate.
She will defeat former Rep. Mike Rogers, who once chaired the House Intelligence Committee and was endorsed by former President Donald Trump earlier this year. Rogers called Slotkin and conceded the race, according to two sources.
“Donald Trump and I were both elected by the people of Michigan. Tens of thousands of Michiganders voted for Donald Trump and Elissa Slotkin on the same ballot, and it is my responsibility to get things done for Michiganders no matter who is in office, just as I did in President Trump’s first term,” Slotkin told reporters Wednesday in Detroit.
“I’m a problem solver, and I will work with anyone who is actually here, to work as your senator. That will always be my first priority,” she added, reiterating her belief that “America is at its best when we have two healthy parties that push and pull and debate on issues of policy and substance and make our laws better.”
Slotkin will be sworn into a GOP-controlled Senate that will be in position to boost Trump’s presidency. The GOP is also looking to defend its narrow majority in the US House of Representatives, though it remains uncalled.
Slotkin will succeed Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, Michigan’s first female US senator, who announced early last year she would step aside and “pass the torch” to a new generation of leadership.
First elected to the House in 2018, Slotkin made appeals to conservative voters, ending both of her debates with Rogers by noting that her dad is a lifelong Republican who feels betrayed by his party’s loyalty to Trump.
“You will always have an open door in my office. You will always have a place at the table, because I want to hear from you,” she vowed during the campaign.
Rogers, who cozied up to Trump despite his previous criticism of the former president after the January 6, 2021, insurrection, highlighted Slotkin’s voting record in support of the Biden-Harris administration’s agenda, as she touted her abilities to be an independent thinker.
The Michigan Republican, whom Democrats attacked for moving to Florida after leaving the House in 2015, repeatedly linked Slotkin to efforts by the administration to incentivize a transition to electric vehicles, a hot-button issue with Michigan’s auto workers.
Slotkin ran television ads across the state telling voters that she doesn’t care what kind of car they drive, as Rogers accused her of wanting to essentially ban gas-powered vehicles in the state.
“I live on a dirt road, nowhere near a charging station, so I don’t own an electric car. No one should tell us what to buy, and no one’s gonna mandate anything,” she said in one spot, explaining that her priority is making sure EVs are made in Michigan instead of in China.
Slotkin also ran a multimillion-dollar ad campaign highlighting Rogers’ previous voting record on abortion legislation, arguing that though access to the procedure is protected in Michigan’s constitution, Republicans would enact a national abortion ban if given the levers of power.
“It’s not a talking point to women, it is our lives. It’s whether we bleed to death in a parking lot. It’s who and when gets to decide how we have a family. Do not trust him,” Slotkin fired back as Rogers vowed in their first debate that he would not defy the will of the Michigan people in Washington.
The Democratic congresswoman said that she would support reforming the Senate’s filibuster rule if elected so that legislation to codify Roe vs. Wade could pass with a simple majority vote in the chamber.
Slotkin also emphasized her position on gun safety, pointing out that she is the first US congresswoman to represent a district that suffered two school shootings, one at Oxford High School in 2021 and another at Michigan State University in 2023.
“This idea that we can’t go after the No. 1 killer of children in America is broken,” she said on the debate stage in Detroit.
In 2022, Slotkin, then the congresswoman for the 8th District, ran to represent the 7th district after Michigan’s congressional map was redrawn to capture a significant part of her Lansing-area constituency in that seat.
Slotkin, who embarked on a road trip-style tour of the state with Stabenow shortly after securing the Democratic nomination for Senate, said when she first decided to launch a bid for the seat, “it wasn’t even a question” if a woman could run, thanks to Stabenow.
Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who often touted her service under presidents of both parties, asked voters just after she won the Democratic primary to “join us on team normal,” a message that persisted throughout her campaign as she tried to build a broad coalition.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/elissa-slotkin-michigan-senate-race/index.html
88,2024 Elections,2024,11,"Moreno will defeat Brown in Ohio, CNN projects, in key pickup for GOP",Simone Pathe,"CNN
 — 
Republican Bernie Moreno will defeat Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, CNN projects, a key pickup for the GOP in a state that’s been trending its way and putting the GOP one step closer to securing the Senate majority.
The three-term incumbent was already the last remaining Democrat in nonjudicial statewide office in the Buckeye State, and his defeat is yet another sign of how down ballot races are increasingly moving in the same direction as the top of the ticket with fewer ticket-splitters.
Moreno, a Cleveland car dealership owner, leaned heavily into his endorsement from former President Donald Trump in a state that backed him by 8 points in both 2016 and 2020. Moreno emerged as the GOP nominee earlier this year after Democrats helped prop him up in the primary, believing he’d be the weakest opponent.
The Republican tried to nationalize the race, trying to tie Brown — a progressive populist first elected to the Senate in 2006 — to Vice President Kamala Harris on immigration and inflation. Moreno’s GOP allies also tried hitting Brown over transgender athletes in an effort to cast the senator as too liberal for the state. (Brown and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee went up with a response ad on the issue that says the senator agrees with GOP Gov. Mike DeWine that “these decisions should be made by local sports leagues, not politicians.”)
Moreno trailed in public polling of the race for most of the year, although those numbers began to tighten as GOP voters consolidated around him in the final weeks before Election Day.
He was able to overcome attacks over abortion, which was a major theme of Democrats’ messaging against him, especially after he made comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters and questioning why women older than 50 would care about the topic. (Moreno’s campaign said he had been “clearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke.”) Democrats seized on those remarks, arguing that Moreno was out of step with Ohioans, who just last year approved a ballot measure enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution with 57% of the vote.
Brown’s significant fundraising strength allowed him to reserve advertising at the more favorable candidate rate and dominate the airwaves over the summer. But Moreno had significant outside firepower from GOP groups that helped boost his candidacy in the fall.

 — 
Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will win reelection to a third term, CNN projects, defeating Democratic challenger Rep. Colin Allred and denying Democrats one of their best chances to mitigate potential losses elsewhere.
The Longhorn State has long been a Republican stronghold, with the GOP winning every statewide election there since 1994. However, amid demographic shifts, Democrats have long seen Texas as a potential future battleground and national party groups poured millions of dollars into trying to boost Allred’s candidacy in the final months of the race.
Allred, a former NFL linebacker who defeated GOP Rep. Pete Sessions to win his House seat in 2018, was seen as a viable challenger. He tried to tie Cruz to the state’s abortion ban, running ads featuring Kate Cox, whom the state Supreme Court blocked from having an abortion after her fetus was diagnosed with a deadly genetic condition.
Allred also went on offense on immigration, trying to flip the script on Republicans. He attacked Cruz for voting against the bipartisan border deal and featured testimonials from border law enforcement officers in his own ads.
But Cruz had also beaten back stiff competition before, narrowly defeating Rep. Beto O’Rourke in a 2018 race in which the Democrat shattered Senate race fundraising records.
This year, he tried to tie Allred to the Biden-Harris administration on inflation, the border wall and transgender issues. (The latter attack prompted a response from the former football player, who said in an ad, “I don’t want boys playing girls’ sports or any of this ridiculous stuff that Ted Cruz is saying.”)
Cruz became a lightning rod early in his Senate career, when he led a government shutdown in a bid to defund then-President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. He was a 2016 presidential candidate, and one of Donald Trump’s most vocal critics in that Republican primary. But he has since aligned himself with the former president, endorsing him in early 2024 ahead of a GOP primary that Trump ultimately coasted through.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/politics/ted-cruz-texas-senate-race/index.html

 — 
Democrat Angela Alsobrooks will win the Maryland Senate race, CNN projects, defeating Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan, whose candidacy made the race to replace retiring Sen. Ben Cardin competitive in this otherwise deep-blue state.
Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, will be just the fourth Black woman elected to the Senate, after Delaware’s Lisa Blunt Rochester won earlier Tuesday, and the first Black senator to represent Maryland.
Her victory is a relief for Democrats, who were facing a daunting Senate landscape before this race came on the map. With most competitive races playing out in states that former President Donald Trump either won or narrowly lost four years ago, Democrats had not been expecting to have to spend in a state President Joe Biden won by more than 30 points.
Democrats’ central argument against Hogan, who left office with high approval ratings after two terms, was that he would be a vote for Republicans in the Senate — especially on the issue of abortion.
Hogan tried to pitch himself as an independent voice, unbeholden to this party. In his first general election ad, he said he’d support codifying Roe v. Wade in federal legislation. And he rejected Trump’s endorsement after the former president said he’d like to see him win the state.
But Democrats effectively nationalized the race. Over the course of the summer and fall, Alsobrooks grew her name recognition and made gains among voters who said they cared about Democrats holding the Senate, according to Washington Post/University of Maryland polling.
Alsbrooks, a mentee of Vice President Kamala Harris, also benefited from her ascension to the top of the ticket, which boosted enthusiasm about electing Black women. Neither made their history-making potential a key message on the trail, but it was resonant in a state where Black voters – and Black women in particular – are a crucial part of the electorate. Alsobrooks’ home turf of Prince George’s County is home to one of the largest middle-class Black populations in the country.
Alsobrooks’ history-making potential was also influential for some voters in the primary, when she scored a stunning primary defeat over Rep. David Trone, who broke the record for self-funding a Senate primary campaign. The co-owner of Total Wine & More spent more than $60 million of his own money but came up more than 10 points short. The Democratic Party quickly united around Alsobrooks, who already had the backing of most of the state’s congressional delegation.

 — 
Republican Sen. Deb Fischer will win reelection in Nebraska, defeating an unexpectedly strong challenge from independent Dan Osborn, CNN projects.
Fischer was first elected to the Senate in 2012, when she became the first female senator elected to a full term in Nebraska. Prior to being elected to Congress, she served in Nebraska’s unicameral legislature.
Osborn, a Navy veteran and industrial mechanic, gave a tougher-than-expected challenge to Fischer.
Osborn and his allies outspent Republicans and garnered attention with buzzy ads, including one in which he burned the word “LIE” into a TV to knock attack ads from his opponent. In another spot, he called Fischer and her colleagues in the US Senate “a bunch of millionaires controlled by billionaires.”
He frequently labeled Fischer a “career politician” and criticized her for backtracking on her promise to run for only two Senate terms. Fischer, who will begin her third Senate term in January, said she changed her mind after realizing how important seniority is for members of Congress.
Fischer portrayed Osborn as a “Trojan horse” for Democrats and sought to tie him to party figures such as Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden, and Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Former President Donald Trump also sought to tie Osborn to the left in his endorsement of Fischer.
“Dan is a ‘Bernie Sanders Democrat’ who does not stand for Nebraska Values, and never will,” Trump wrote on Truth Social on September.
Osborn, meanwhile, painted himself as a populist and took policy positions that didn’t fit neatly into either party. He said he personally opposes abortion but thinks it should be legal and called himself a supporter of the Second Amendment. He backed lowering taxes on overtime pay, boosting benefits for servicemembers and veterans, and legalizing cannabis.
He declined support from the Democratic Party and refused to say which party he would caucus with if elected or to share who he voted for in 2020 or planned to vote for in 2024.
Nebraska Democrats, who said at one point they were in talks with Osborn to form a coalition, did not field a candidate or publicly back Osborn.

92,2024 Elections,2024,11,"Republican Sen. Rick Scott will win second term in Florida, CNN projects",Steve Contorno,"CNN
 — 
Republican Sen. Rick Scott will win a second term in Florida, CNN projects, defeating Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in a race that demonstrated the strength of the GOP in a state once considered one of the country’s premier political battlegrounds.
With a return to the Senate next year assured, Scott is positioned to wage his uphill bid to succeed Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader in the new Congress. The secret-ballot vote is set to take place sometime after the election.
Scott unsuccessfully challenged McConnell for his leadership position in 2022, as the Florida senator was coming off an underwhelming turn in charge of his party’s Senate campaign operation that cycle. But Scott’s odds of succeeding McConnell this time could benefit from his close relationship with his state’s most famous resident: former President Donald Trump.
Scott’s victory over Mucarsel-Powell caps what ultimately was the least competitive race of a political career defined in part by exceptionally hard-fought contests. Scott narrowly won two terms as governor by about 1 percentage point in 2010 and 2014 and then unseated Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in 2018 by 10,0000 votes out of 8.2 million ballots cast — one of the closest statewide elections in Florida history.
To win those races, Scott, a former health care executive and one of the country’s wealthiest elected officials, dipped deeply into his personal fortune, including a $63 million investment in his first Senate campaign. This time, though, he spent far less of his own money as Mucarsel-Powell, a former South Florida congresswoman, struggled to fundraise.
Democrats made a late play for the seat as other paths to maintaining their Senate majority grew increasingly tenuous. In September, they announced a multimillion-dollar advertising push in Florida, a token investment in a historically expensive state to compete.
There was hope, though, that Mucarsel-Powell could build on the enthusiasm surrounding Vice President Kamala Harris’ entrance into the race. Democrats remained optimistic, too, that ballot measures to legalize recreational marijuana and expand abortion access in the state could give their Senate nominee a boost. Mucarsel-Powell campaigned aggressively on abortion in a state where it is now illegal for women to undergo the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy, unless their life is at risk or they’re the victim of rape or incest.
However, Scott benefited greatly from a favorable shift in the state’s political makeup since he first entered the Senate. Six years ago, registered Democrats still outnumbered Republicans in Florida. Now, the GOP has a one million-voter advantage in the state, a deficit that has made it structurally difficult for Democrats to compete.
After running neck and neck in all of his previous races, Scott never trailed Mucarsel-Powell, though the race certainly appeared to tighten in the closing months.
Scott’s victory guarantees that Republicans will continue to hold every statewide office in Florida for at least two more years. In a second term, Scott has said he would prioritize putting term limits on members of Congress, shuttering federal agencies and building a wall along the US-Mexico border.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/politics/florida-senate-rick-scott-wins/index.html

 — 
Republican Tim Sheehy will defeat three-term Montana Sen. Jon Tester, CNN projects, adding to Republicans’ newly won Senate majority.
Montana has long been a deep-red state in presidential elections — and every other statewide office is currently held by a Republican. But Tester, a seven-fingered dirt farmer who had cut a moderate profile on Capitol Hill, previously had defied political gravity with his wins in 2006, 2012 and 2018.
Still, his seat – alongside Democratic-held seats in two other red states, Ohio and West Virginia – was a prime Republican target this year. Republicans Bernie Moreno and Jim Justice won those races, respectively.
This year marked the first time Tester had to share the ballot with Trump, who won the state by 16 percentage points in 2020 and nearly 20 points in 2016 — a reality that meant the Democratic incumbent needed to out-run the top of his party’s ticket by double digits to be competitive.

Trump will win second term, CNN projects, in historic comeback after losing four years ago
Democrats cast Sheehy, a retired Navy SEAL, as an out-of-state millionaire with questionable ranching credentials and commitment to public land – the same playbook used against Republican Matt Rosendale in 2018.
Sheehy moved to Montana in 2014 after leaving the military, but Republicans believed carpetbagging attacks would have limited appeal in a state that is home to more transplants after the coronavirus pandemic.
In the closing weeks of the race, Democrats stepped up their attacks over Sheehy’s conflicting story from nearly a decade ago over how a bullet became lodged in his arm.

 — 
Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein will win North Carolina’s gubernatorial race, CNN projects, defeating Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, whose campaign struggled as his history of incendiary remarks became public.
Stein, who is currently serving his second term as attorney general, will become the state’s first Jewish governor. He will replace incumbent Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is term-limited.
Stein’s victory is a boon to Democrats as they have looked to the governorship to serve as a check on Republicans, who control both chambers of the legislature. The result also comes as little surprise.
Though Democrats predicted a competitive race in the state, Robinson’s history of inflammatory comments ultimately doomed his campaign.
“Tonight, the people of North Carolina resoundingly embraced a vision that’s optimistic, forward-looking and welcoming — a vision that is about creating opportunity for every North Carolinian,” Stein told supporters at his election night party Tuesday in Raleigh.
Robinson said in his concession speech that he was proud of the race he ran and left the door open to pursuing higher office in the future.
“The only disappointment that I have inside of me is the disappointment that you all feel, because I know so many of you wanted so bad to see nothing but victory tonight,” Robinson said. “But remember, victory is pleasing God.”
State and national Republicans distanced themselves from Robinson after a CNN KFile report found that Robinson had made dozens of disturbing posts on a pornography website’s message board more than a decade ago, in which he called himself a “black Nazi” and a “perv,” admitted to watching women undress in a locker room and expressed support for reinstating slavery.
Robinson denied that he made the posts, which were tied to a username CNN was able to identify as Robinson by matching a litany of biographical details and a shared email address between the two. Ahead of and after the story’s release, Robinson rejected calls from Republicans to drop out of the race.
In the months prior to the porn-forum report, Stein led Robinson in polls and fundraising, while blasting him in TV ads over his history of inflammatory comments, particularly denigrating women and opposing abortion access. Robinson also had a long history of making antisemitic comments and targeting LGBTQ community victims of school shootings.
He also failed to gain the endorsement of key Republicans in the state, including former Gov. Pat McCrory and Sen. Thom Tillis, who endorsed one of Robinson’s opponents in the GOP gubernatorial primary.
Stein, meanwhile, ran on his record as state attorney general, specifically his work closing North Carolina’s rape-kit backlog, which had become one of the largest in the country.
In Stein’s stump speech, he warned that the state couldn’t afford “job-killing culture wars,” a reference to his opponent and to 2016 legislation that required transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificate. The state faced widespread boycotts and protests before it was rolled back in 2017.
Born in Washington, DC, Stein’s family relocated to North Carolina when he was young. His father, Adam Stein, co-founded the state’s first racially integrated law firm. Stein received a bachelor’s degree from Dartmouth College and his law degree from Harvard University.
Republicans hoped that Robinson’s humbler beginnings would help him better relate to working-class voters. The lieutenant governor grew up in poverty, the ninth of 10 kids, and spoke frequently of how his mother raised the family after his father died. He pointed to his time working at factory jobs that laid him off as jobs were sent overseas.
Robinson’s political career began in 2018, when he delivered a viral speech at a Greensboro city council meeting in defense of gun owners’ rights in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting. Two years later, he was elected lieutenant governor.

 — 
Republican former Sen. Kelly Ayotte will win the New Hampshire governor’s race, CNN projects, completing a political comeback eight years after she lost her Senate seat.
Ayotte defeated Democratic former Manchester Mayor Joyce Craig in the race to replace outgoing GOP Gov. Chris Sununu.
The race was a test of whether local interests or the national political atmosphere would play the most important role in influencing Granite State voters. Republicans sought to localize the race, hammering Craig on Manchester’s drug and homelessness problems during her time as mayor. Democrats attempted to nationalize it, tying Ayotte to former President Donald Trump and attacking her on abortion rights.
The tactics made sense: New Hampshire has a long history of ticket-splitting but has trended increasingly more Democratic in national contests. Hillary Clinton won there by just half a point in 2016, but President Joe Biden won by 7 points in 2020.
It’s the second time Ayotte shared the GOP ticket with Trump. She was ousted from her Senate seat in 2016 by Maggie Hassan after a single term.
Ayotte withdrew her endorsement of the former president in 2016 in the wake of the “Access Hollywood” tape’s release but supported Trump this year.
After that 2016 loss, she helped shepherd Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch through the confirmation process in 2017. She also served on a number of corporations’ boards of directors after her Senate term ended.

96,2024 Elections,2024,11,"7 states vote to protect abortion rights, while efforts to expand access in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota fail",Amy O’Kruk,"CNN
 — 
More than two years after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the federal constitutional right to an abortion, voters in 10 states cast ballots on whether to cement reproductive rights in their state constitutions.
Measures to protect abortion access will pass in Arizona and Missouri, where citizens effectively voted to overturn their state’s abortion bans. Abortion rights supporters are hopeful this will lead to a widespread increase in access to reproductive care in those states.
Similar measures will pass in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Montana and Nevada, cementing or expanding current abortion access. And measures to protect abortion failed in Florida, where the procedure is banned six weeks into pregnancy, and South Dakota, where it is banned, except to save the life of the mother.
In Nebraska, an amendment cementing the state’s current 12-week abortion ban in the state constitution will pass, while a competing amendment to codify the right to an abortion will fail, CNN projects.
Since Roe was overturned in 2022, seven states had seen a popular vote on abortion rights prior to this year. Every measure aimed at protecting access passed, while all measures to restrict it failed.
Nebraska
Voters in Nebraska will approve a measure to enshrine the state’s current 12-week abortion ban into the state’s constitution, with exceptions for rape, incest and medical emergencies, CNN projects.
The measure was one of two abortion-related initiatives on the ballot in Nebraska. Voters are projected to reject a competing measure to enshrine the right to an abortion until viability or to protect the health of the pregnant woman in the state’s constitution.
This year marked the first time in state history that two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot. Organizers campaigned fiercely to get their respective measures on the ballot – with each side accusing the other of using misleading tactics.
Missouri
Voters in Missouri will approve a measure to enshrine the right to an abortion up to the point of viability in the state’s constitution, CNN projects.
The measure will establish a right to make reproductive care decisions without government interference and protect those seeking or providing care from government discrimination.
The projected win for reproductive rights advocates will greatly expand access to abortion in the state, where the procedure is currently banned with no exceptions for rape or incest. Doctors believe fetus viability to be around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.
South Dakota
Voters in South Dakota will reject a measure that would have guaranteed a constitutional right to an abortion – with regulations – during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy, CNN projects.
Reproductive rights advocates were hopeful this measure would return abortion access to pregnant survivors of rape or incest, who have no abortion options under the state’s current law.
Nevada
Nevada voters will approve a measure that would establish the fundamental right to an abortion up to the point of fetal viability in the state’s constitution, CNN projects. To amend the constitution, however, Nevada voters will still have to approve the measure again in 2026.
Montana
CNN projects that voters in Montana will approve a measure to amend the state’s constitution to protect the right to make decisions about one’s own pregnancy – including the right to an abortion – through fetal viability or when needed to protect the pregnant patient’s life or health.
While abortion is currently legal through viability in Montana, the measure will shore up the right to the procedure in Montana by enshrining a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed a law in 2023 that specified that access to an abortion is no longer protected under the right of privacy in the state’s constitution, challenging that precedent.
Arizona
Arizona voters will approve a measure to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution up to fetal viability, CNN projects.
The win for reproductive rights advocates will expand access to the procedure in the state, which currently bans abortion at 15 weeks into pregnancy. Doctors believe fetus viability to be around 22 to 24 weeks.
The Arizona State Supreme Court voted in April to uphold a Civil War-era total ban on abortion, sparking national outrage and prompting state lawmakers to repeal the ban before it could take effect. Abortion rights supporters said the moment served as a stark reminder of what could come if reproductive rights weren’t enshrined in the state constitution.
Colorado
Colorado voters will approve a measure to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution, CNN projects. While abortion remains legal in the state with no gestational limit, the approval of the amendment means public funds can be used toward abortions.
That will clear the way for the state to potentially cover abortions under Medicaid and some state employee health insurance plans. Abortion rights supporters say this will go a long way toward expanding abortion access, especially among low-income individuals.
Maryland
Voters in Maryland will approve a measure to enshrine reproductive protections, including the right to end a pregnancy, in the state’s constitution, CNN projects. The procedure is already legal in the state with no gestational limit.
In 2023, Maryland enacted a shield law protecting its abortion providers from investigations by other states. While the state’s vote will have little impact on abortion access for its own residents, proponents say it’s important to solidify reproductive freedoms in a state that has become an access point for out-of-state patients.
New York
CNN projects that New York voters will approve a measure that would amend the equal protection clause of the state’s constitution to say that a person’s rights cannot be denied due to “pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.”
The amendment survived several legal challenges to make it onto the state ballot. It seeks to provide protections against discrimination due to a number of factors, including pregnancy outcomes, age, disability, sexual orientation and gender identity. While proponents focused on abortion rights, opponents used the measure’s broad nature to raise concerns about transgender and parental issues.
Florida
A Florida measure to protect the right to an abortion up to the point of viability will fail, CNN projects. Although the measure is projected to receive a majority of votes, it will not meet the 60% voter threshold needed to pass.
Both abortion rights supporters and opponents campaigned fiercely on the issue. A federal judge recently accused officials of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration of attempting to violate First Amendment rights in their campaign against the ballot measure.
The Sunshine State once served as a critical access point for patients from Southern states with more restrictive abortion policies.

97,2024 Elections,2024,11,"8 states will vote to bar noncitizen voting, CNN projects, something already illegal in federal elections",Kaanita Iyer,"CNN
 — 
Voters in eight states, most of them heavily Republican, will approve ballot measures to require US citizenship to vote, CNN projects, even though it is already illegal for noncitizens to cast ballots in federal elections.
The victorious ballot measures in Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Wisconsin come on the heels of House Republicans passing a bill with a similar goal this summer and with former President Donald Trump and his allies stoking fears of voter fraud ahead of the election.
CNN has fact-checked the Republican allegations of widespread noncitizen voting and found only a tiny number of examples of noncitizens voting in elections when they were ineligible to do so. In one recent example, Michigan prosecutors charged a Chinese citizen with voter fraud and perjury after he allegedly cast a ballot in the 2024 election.
Here are the state ballot measures on noncitizen voting projected to be approved:
Idaho
Idaho voters will approve a ballot measure to amend the state’s constitution to add a sentence saying that noncitizens are barred from voting in any election within the state, CNN projects.
The Idaho Constitution says that “every male or female citizen of the United States” who meets certain age and residency requirements is eligible to vote in the state.
A few municipalities across the country allow noncitizens to vote in certain local elections, including Washington, DC, but none in Idaho.
Iowa
CNN projects Iowa voters will approve a ballot measure that addresses noncitizen voting as part of a broader amendment to the state constitution, which will also update the voting age to reflect the federal standard.
Iowa’s Constitution currently lists the required age of voting as 21, even though it has been abiding by the 26th Amendment of the US Constitution, which set the voting age at 18.
The constitutional amendment will alter the language to say that “only a citizen of the United States of the age of eighteen years” and only a resident of the state can vote – changing both the age and using the phrase “only a citizen” instead of “every citizen.”
Kentucky
Kentucky voters will approve a ballot measure to make an addition to the state’s constitution saying that “No person who is not a citizen of the United States shall be allowed to vote in this state.”
The section of the Kentucky Constitution that this measure will amend already lists citizenship as one of the requirements to vote.
Missouri
Missouri voters will approve an amendment to the state’s constitution to assert that “only citizens of the United States” can vote in elections, CNN projects.
Currently, the state constitution says, “All citizens of the United States” over the age of 18 and those who reside in Missouri “are entitled to vote at all elections.”
The amendment will also outlaw ranked-choice voting, which allows voters to rank candidates in order of preference.
North Carolina
North Carolina voters will approve a ballot measure to change the section of the state constitution that lists the requirements to vote, CNN projects.
The state constitution currently says that “every person born in the United States and every person who has been naturalized” can vote in North Carolina, provided they are over the age of 18 and a resident. With the projected approval of the amendment, the text will be changed to say that “only a citizen of the United States” who has met the other requirements may vote.
The projected result is a win for North Carolina’s GOP supermajority, which advanced the measure to the ballot.
Oklahoma
CNN projects that Oklahoma voters will approve a ballot measure to change the state’s constitution to say that “only” instead of “all” citizens who are residents of the state and over the age of 18 are “qualified” to vote.
The measure landed on the ballot after Oklahoma’s Republican-dominated Legislature voted to advance it.
South Carolina
CNN projects South Carolina voters will approve an amendment to the state’s constitution to say that “only a citizen of the United States and of this State” who is at least 18 years of age and “properly registered” can vote.
The state constitution currently says that “every citizen” can vote if the other requirements are met.
The state’s GOP-led Legislature passed a bill to put this measure on the ballot.
Wisconsin
Wisconsin voters will approve an amendment to the state’s constitution that targets noncitizen voting, CNN projects.
Wisconsin’s Constitution currently says that “every United States citizen” who is over the age of 18 and a resident can vote. The projected result will change the language to state that “only” citizens can vote if they meet the other requirements.
The state’s GOP-led legislature voted to add the measure on the November ballot.

98,2024 Elections,2024,11,"Hochman elected Los Angeles County district attorney, ousting progressive Gascón",Associated Press,"CNN
 — 
Nathan Hochman defeated George Gascón in the race for Los Angeles County district attorney, unseating an incumbent known as the godfather of progressive prosecutors.
Hochman, a former federal prosecutor, calls himself a “hard middle” candidate who would reject both mass incarceration and the “public safety failure” of Gascón’s tenure the past four years.
He advanced out of a primary field of 11 challengers and spent most of the campaign attacking Gascón policies that he says led to increased crime and a lack of consequences for juvenile offenders. During debates, he spotlighted rising violent crime in the county since 2019, a trend also seen statewide.
“The voters of Los Angeles County have spoken and have said enough is enough of D.A. Gascón’s pro-criminal extreme policies; they look forward to a safer future,” Hochman said in a statement early Wednesday. “As D.A., I look forward to representing all of the people, whether they voted for me or not, since their safety will be my responsibility.”
Gascón conceded the race to Hochman and called him Wednesday, his campaign said.
“The rightward shift across America last night is heartbreaking. Democrats have a long road ahead, but the work is more vital than ever and our commitment will not waver,” Gascón said in a statement. “I’m deeply proud of what we’ve accomplished over the past four years and grateful to the communities who have been and will always be the heart of criminal justice reform.”

Hochman’s victory reflects growing discontent in the state with progressive district attorneys who have pushed criminal justice reform. Previously there were two attempts to recall Gascón that failed to qualify for the ballot. San Francisco voters ousted one of the first reform-minded prosecutors elected to office in 2022. Oakland voters were asked in Tuesday’s election whether to recall their own district attorney, Pamela Price, another progressive prosecutor, but it was too early to call.
Gascón co-authored a ballot measure passed by California voters in 2014 that reclassified certain low-level drug and property crimes as misdemeanors instead of felonies. Also Tuesday, voters approved a measure to partly roll back that law, making shoplifting a felony for repeat offenders again and increasing penalties for some drug charges.
Despite Gascón being a former Los Angeles police officer, Hochman had the support of local police unions.
He was also endorsed by victims’ advocacy groups; former district attorney Jackie Lacey, whom Gascón defeated in 2020; developer and former mayoral candidate Rick Caruso; and more than 70 current and former county elected officials. Hochman raised nearly $4 million for the campaign.
Hochman’s victory was applauded by the prosecutors’ union, which in a statement called it a “pivotal moment in the fight to return balance and accountability to the justice system.”
A Southern California native, Hochman emphasized his past prosecutorial experience as assistant US attorney in California’s Central District. He has also practiced as a private defense attorney.
He previously ran unsuccessfully for California attorney general as a Republican, but was an independent in this race and describes himself as a lifelong centrist.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/los-angeles-district-attorney-nathan-hochman/index.html

Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator, will win her state’s at-large US House seat, making her the first out transgender person to serve in Congress, CNN projects.
The at-large seat was vacated when outgoing Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester opted to run for the state’s open US Senate seat.
Despite running in a reliably blue state, McBride emphasized her work leading a bipartisan push to pass paid family and medical leave in the state. She also touted support from unions and work to raise the state minimum wage. Though she didn’t lean on the historic nature of her run, she alluded to a broader theme of respect – specifically, that everyone deserves a member of Congress that respects them and their families.
The incoming congresswoman is a close ally of President Joe Biden and has been credited with helping shape Biden’s view of LGBTQ issues. McBride entered Biden’s orbit in 2006, when she worked for the late Beau Biden’s attorney general campaign. Beau Biden was also a strong backer of the 2013 transgender protections legislation that McBride advocated for in Delaware.

Cray, a transgender man and fellow activist, died of cancer in 2014 just days after the two married.
McBride, a former spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ rights group, has made history throughout her public life. In 2012, as a senior and student body president at American University, she made national news when she announced she was transgender in an op-ed in the school’s paper.
At the time, McBride wrote about her concerns that her gender identity would not be compatible with her goals of running for office.
“I now know that my dreams and my identity are only mutually exclusive if I don’t try,” she wrote.
Four years later, McBride became the first transgender person to address a national party convention, when she spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.
And in 2020, McBride became the first out transgender person elected to serve in a state Senate, when she was elected to represent a seat in northern Delaware.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/politics/sarah-mcbride-delaware-transgender-congress/index.html

 — 
Almost immediately after it became clear that Donald Trump was on his way to reelection Tuesday night, phones began pinging in the president-elect’s orbit and the conversation at several of the dining tables in the Mar-a-Lago ballroom turned to who would staff a second Trump term.
Those hushed discussions have now morphed into an all-out battle that is playing out directly from the patio of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Almost every single table was filled Wednesday night amid maneuvering over who was sitting where and how close their table was to where Trump usually holds court, at a table behind a velvet rope, two people told CNN.
Onlookers spotted Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Tom Barrack and Trump’s transition co-chairs, Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, milling about the club earlier Wednesday. Trump spent part of the day going through names that had been previously lined up by Lutnick in the months before the election, though some have questioned whether Trump will rely solely on his recommendations.

A buoyant Trump believes he has a mandate to hit the ground running as he revels behind closed doors
Already, those seeking top posts have been working the phones in an attempt to form alliances with others who are also hoping to secure a spot in the Trump administration. Several even booked flights to Florida to ensure face time with Trump in the coming days, when many of the decisions are expected to be made.
As he narrows down his choices, Trump has crossed several options off the list already, according to several people familiar with the chaotic but aggressive process underway.
Rep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican who is House GOP conference chair, is under consideration to be the next US ambassador to the United Nations.
And one of the biggest battles that emerged – over chief of staff – has since been resolved.
Trump on Thursday named his campaign manager Susie Wiles to the role, touting her as the first woman to hold it. Wiles is widely credited for running what was seen as Trump’s most disciplined campaign.
But that contest had previously boiled down to two names: Wiles and Brooke Rollins, who served in Trump’s first term and runs the America First Policy Institute. Rollins ultimately stood down from vying for the role after it became clear that seeking it would amount to a serious power struggle with Wiles. Rollins is still expected to take some role in a Trump administration.
Trump was encouraged to move on the chief of staff role faster than he did in 2016 during a chaotic transition, when he waited until the following Sunday to name Reince Priebus to the job. Having a chief of staff in place would allow for there to be a power center that people could go to instead of calling Trump directly.
However, one person noted that it’s been Trump himself who has dialed people he wants to see in key positions in recent days.
Occasionally over the past few months, Trump floated names as possible administration picks, but he would not engage further. Sources close to the former president said that because he was superstitious, Trump often refused to engage in lengthier conversations about who would be placed in an administration before the election took place.
As he shores up his staff, Trump is eager to reward those who stood by him the last two years, and he’s made clear in recent private conversations that he’ll seek to accommodate those who have done so – even if their viewpoints don’t necessarily align with his.

CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump is reveling in his victory and the subsequent celebration, being described as having a much different mentality than he did in 2017 and feeling like his popular vote win gives him a mandate as he speaks with world leaders, top aides and allies, business CEOs and his transition team.
Sources who have spoken to Trump in the last 24 hours describe him as forward-looking and grateful. He has lavished praise on his campaign co-chairs, Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles – who Trump named as his White House chief of staff on Thursday evening. Trump has boasted about his numbers with minority voters and winning the popular vote, sometimes with disbelief, and asked what they need to do to get started on some of his agenda items.
One person described the president-elect as in a “completely different head space” than he was when he was entering office in 2017. With some sources he talked about some of the various events that would be occurring under his presidency, including the World Cup and Olympics. With another he marveled at the positivity and flattery he has received in calls from the more than dozen foreign leaders with whom he has spoken.
“He feels like he’s getting the respect and recognition he deserves,” another source said.

Putin congratulates Trump on winning presidency
00:18 - Source: CNN
In the 2016 election, Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton – and he repeatedly claimed falsely that he had won it. Trump then took office in January 2017 amid an FBI investigation into Russian election interference that he believed threatened his legitimacy and would eventually lead to the appointment of a special counsel who investigated Trump for the first half of his presidency.
Now Trump is ahead in the popular vote by more than 4 million votes and feels like he’s coming into office with a clear runway to enact the policies he ran on, sources close to the president-elect said.
“He is talking about how Americans want his policies and what he needs to do to get that done,” one source who had spoken to the president-elect said.
Trump has been locked down at his Florida club, taking calls, meeting sporadically with donors and mingling with guests on the patio. X owner Elon Musk and Trump recently spent time there together and the mega-billionaire brought some of his children to stay with him. The president-elect even took time on Wednesday to show the kids around before Musk left later in the day. During one conversation, Trump joked that he thought Musk should serve in his Cabinet but that he knew Musk would never go for it, a source familiar with the conversation said.
Trump has enjoyed phone calls with several foreign leaders, including some whom he remained in contact with after leaving the White House, who have similarly praised his electoral win, according to a source familiar with the president-elect’s disposition.
Trump missed his standing his 9 p.m. dinner reservation at his Mar-a-Lago resort Wednesday night, which advisers said was because he was taking calls and gearing up for what is likely to be a grueling next week. Trump’s priority is to finalize his Cabinet and senior White House staff, and the second wave is to sort deputy secretaries. The president-elect has told his team he wants to sign off on every position.
One source close to Trump said he is taking the responsibility of choosing top positions much more seriously than he did the first time around. He has told people close to him that he made mistakes during his first term with his hiring decisions, and he wants to make sure he is picking people who are competent but also loyal to him.
“That would seem like an obvious thing, but he feels strongly that in 2016 he allowed people who were around him and knew more about DC to make decisions for him. He is far more involved now,” a Trump adviser told CNN.
Top executive orders being prepared that he has specifically weighed in on includes open energy exploration, such as removing caps and provisions that prevent companies from drilling. He is also plotting cuts to energy regulations.
Popular vote win ‘changes everything’
Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller told CNN that Trump’s expected victory with the popular vote “changes everything,” arguing it gives the president-elect confidence to enact his agenda without fear of alienating a broad swath of the country.
“Winning the popular vote provides a mandate and a national public confidence to accomplish what he wants to do from the Oval Office, especially with regard to fixing the economy and securing the border,” Miller said.
A second Trump adviser described the president-elect as feeling emboldened and more self-assured in the decisions he is making after winning the popular vote. While Trump is still seeking advice from a series of aides and allies and picking their brains on who to choose for certain Cabinet positions and policy priorities for his first 100 days in office, he feels more decisive, the adviser said.
Trump met with his transition team, which is rapidly ramping up to staff his administration, both on Wednesday and again on Thursday, sources say.
He spoke by phone Wednesday with both President Joe Biden and his 2024 opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump is expected to travel to the White House to meet with Biden, a meeting his aides would like to happen quickly, as soon as early next week.
“Very nice calls, very respectful both ways,” Trump said in an interview with NBC News. He said that with Harris they “talked about transition, and she said she’d like it to be smooth as can be, which I agree with, of course.”
One thing that Trump hasn’t done: golfed.
Trump often plays golf to blow off steam, especially after major events. But Trump has not golfed since the second assassination attempt against him and is not expected to do so in the near future, according to one source.
Trump understands the magnitude of the security issue, the source added.
Trump’s aides, however, anticipate that he will make use of the golf courses at Andrews Air Force Base when back in the White House. Barack Obama often golfed at the courses at Andrews while he was president. Trump mostly golfed at his club in Virginia while at the White House during his term.

 — 
A federal judge on Thursday struck down the Biden administration’s “parole in place” policy that gave legal status to certain undocumented individuals who are married to US citizens.
US District Judge J. Campbell Barker had previously put an administrative hold on the regulation, rolled out earlier this year when President Joe Biden was running for reelection, as the judge considered the lawsuit brought by Texas and 15 other states. The policy shielded select undocumented spouses of US citizens from deportation and allowed them to work legally in the country as they sought citizenship.
In his Thursday ruling on the merits of their case, Barker, appointed by President-elect Donald Trump during his first term, said that Congress had not given the executive branch the authority to implement such a policy. He wrote that “history and purpose confirm that defendants’ view” of the relevant immigration law “stretches legal interpretation past its breaking point.”
The case is one of several ongoing legal challenges to Biden administration policies that the incoming Trump administration may refuse to defend after the White House changes hands.
Barker rejected a request by individuals who benefited from the program to intervene in the case so that they could also defend the policy.
The policy would have applied to people who have been living in the United States for 10 years, and utilized existing legal authority known as “parole in place” that offers deportation protections. In addition to spouses, the policy would also apply to undocumented stepchildren of US citizens.
As CNN previously reported, it was estimated that the program could directly affect 750,000 to 800,000 people. That could have made it the federal government’s most sweeping relief program since the 2012 implementation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which shields undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as minors from deportation.
DACA itself is currently the target of a yearslong legal challenge. An appeals court earlier this fall heard arguments on a judge’s ruling that deemed the DACA program unlawful but allowed it to continue for current enrollees while an appeal played out.

103,General Politics,2024,11,Trump announces campaign manager Susie Wiles as White House chief of staff,Steve Contorno,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump announced on Thursday that his campaign manager, Susie Wiles, will be named his White House chief of staff.
“Susie Wiles just helped me achieve one of the greatest political victories in American history, and was an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns,” the president-elect said in a statement.
“Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected. Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female Chief of Staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud,” Trump added.
CNN reported earlier Thursday that Wiles was considered the front-runner for the job but had some reservations about the role and had expressed to Trump certain conditions before she accepted, a source said. At the top of the list was more control over who can reach the president in the Oval Office.
“The clown car can’t come into the White House at will,” the source said. “And he agrees with her.”
During Trump’s first term, his chiefs of staff struggled to prevent a roving cast of informal advisers, family members, friends and other interlopers from getting inside the White House to meet with him. Trump is often influenced on an issue by whoever he speaks to last, a fact that is well known within his circle and one that made life difficult on his top aides.
Wiles was widely credited for running what was seen as Trump’s most sophisticated and disciplined campaign, which included keeping many of the fringe voices in his orbit at bay.
For most of the campaign, she was in charge of the flight manifest for Trump’s private plane – a thankless job that required her to shut down access to the former president when he wouldn’t tell someone “no” himself. At times, she also had to confront Trump about keeping certain people at arm’s length – though, her inability to prevent far-right provocateur Laura Loomer from joining the former president at a debate and a 9/11 memorial service created significant blowback for her boss.
Brooke Rollins, who was also under consideration for chief of staff and had some big names aligning with her, stood down from vying from the role Wednesday after it became clear that seeking it would amount to a serious power struggle with Wiles and that the role was Wiles’ for the taking, according to a person familiar.
Rollins, who served in Trump’s first term, now runs the America First Policy Institute and is still expected to have a role in the second Trump administration.
The chief of staff post — the second-most-important office in the West Wing — is one of the few remaining jobs in the federal government to have never been held by a woman. Kamala Harris was the first woman to be vice president. And many other senior positions in the government have been helmed by women, including almost all of the Cabinet posts, top judicial seats and House leadership roles. But no woman has ever assumed the top Pentagon position, nor has one served on the joint chiefs of staff or as the chief justice of the Supreme Court.
The daughter of the late NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall and a seasoned political operative from Florida, Wiles is one of the longest-serving advisers in Trump’s orbit. After helping him win Florida in 2020, she served as his de facto chief of staff during his post-presidency and then led his campaign for the entirety of the race – a rare feat in Trump world.
On election night, Trump credited Wiles during his victory speech, though she declined to address the crowd gathered at the Palm Beach Convention Center, instead turning the microphone over to co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita.
Her willingness to stay in the background has endeared her to Trump and to his allies, several of whom have already endorsed her publicly for the job.
“Susie Wiles ran Trump’s best campaign of the three, and it wasn’t particularly close,” Turning Point USA CEO Charlie Kirk wrote on X. “She’s disciplined, she’s smart, and she doesn’t seek the limelight. She would make an incredible Chief of Staff. The president, and America, would be well served with Susie in that key role.”

104,General Politics,2024,11,Trump is likely to allow Fed chair to stay. Powell said he can’t be fired anyway,Kayla Tausche,"Washington
CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump remains likely to allow Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remainder of his term, which expires in May 2026, according to a senior adviser to Trump who requested anonymity to describe private conversations.
The adviser cautioned that Trump could always change his mind, but his present view — and that of Trump’s economic team — is that Powell should remain atop the central bank as it pursues its policy of cutting interest rates. Trump in July told Bloomberg he had intended to keep Powell in his role at least for the duration of his term.
Still, Powell was peppered with questions about his job security during his first post-election press conference Thursday. Powell issued a terse “No” in response to a question about whether he would leave his Fed post before his term is up if President-elect Donald Trump asked him to. Powell later clarified that he believes Trump cannot fire him.
”Not permitted under the law,” Powell said.
Trump appointed Powell, a Republican former private equity executive who served on the central bank’s governing board, to its top spot in 2018.
President Joe Biden reappointed him to a second four-year term.
Gary Cohn, the Goldman Sachs alum who served as economic policy director during Trump’s first administration, is said to want the job, but former Trump officials have said the fact that Cohn resigned in protest over Trump’s steel tariffs makes it highly unlikely he’d get it.
Among the names mentioned by sources in touch with the Trump transition are Kevin Warsh, who served for five years on the bank’s board of governors and advised Trump during his first term; as well as Trump’s former chief economist Kevin Hassett.

Trump’s allies are already jockeying for high-powered spots in his administration
In July, before Trump was elected, the Fed chair was asked whether he intended to serve out the remainder of his term, and he said, unequivocally, “Yes.”
Trump has frequently aired frustrations with Powell and occasionally threatened to remove the Fed chair from his post, which no president has ever done.
Trump has also criticized what he perceives as a lack of transparency by the Fed, which conducts its policy deliberations in private and releases the notes from those discussions weeks later. CNN has reported that Trump aides have suggested he would like real-time release of those minutes and economic reports and for the meetings to be conducted on-camera.
Trump’s fraught history with Powell
Trump and Powell clashed several times during his first term, with the president-elect threatening to fire him from the post on several occasions.
In 2018, Trump said he was considering replacing Powell with a new Fed chair after the central bank raised interest rates. A president, however, cannot easily remove a Fed chair once confirmed unless they break the law.
After markets tanked at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, Trump told reporters he had the “right to remove (Powell) as chairman,” adding that “he has, so far, made a lot of bad decisions, in my opinion.”
More recently, Trump also said the Fed chair is among the easiest jobs in the government. “You show up to the office once a month and you say, ‘Let’s flip a coin,’ and everybody talks about you like you’re a god,” Trump said last month at an event hosted by the Economic Club of Chicago.

Trump also said his prior threats to remove Powell “because he was keeping the rates too high” caused the Fed chair to lower rates “too much.”
While the Fed chair has the most clout at Federal Open Market Committee meetings, they are not the only official to determine where interest rates should be. At every monetary policy meeting there are 11 other Fed officials who vote on interest rate moves.

105,General Politics,2024,11,Biden faces doubts over his legacy as he prepares to hand over power to the man he called a threat to democracy,Michael Williams,"Washington
CNN
 — 
For years, President Joe Biden has used a single phrase to diminish his onetime rival Donald Trump while signaling his own adherence to American political tradition: “You can’t love your country only when you win.”
As Biden conceded his vice president’s loss to Trump from the White House Rose Garden on Thursday, the line carried a different significance.
No longer finger-wagging at a defeated rival who refused to acknowledge his loss, Biden is now overseeing a transition back into office by the man he once – and still – believes is an existential threat to democracy.
Instead of using his final 10 weeks in power to cement his promise to act as a generational bridge and tout his signature accomplishments, Biden finds himself in one of the worst possible positions: A president acknowledging the loss of a race in which he was pushed out, preparing to be displaced by a man who for years he has cast as an existential threat to democracy in America.
Yet if those crushing factors are weighing deeply on Biden, his demeanor in the Rose Garden belied the hurt.
Seeking to comfort Americans scared of the prospects of another Trump term, while his own legacy remains in question, Biden was upbeat rather than downtrodden.
“Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,” the president said in the Rose Garden during his first public remarks since Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. “We all get knocked down, but the measure of our character, as my dad would say, is how quickly we get back up.”
He was welcomed into the garden by a crowd of staffers and Cabinet members, who cheered for him as he walked from the Oval Office.
“Campaigns are contests of competing visions. The country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made,” he said, making explicit that he accepted the results of the election.
“Remember,” Biden said, “a defeat does not mean we are defeated. We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up.”
Biden in his remarks was intentional in his efforts to endorse the sanctity of the election and acknowledge Trump’s resulting victory.
Within one day, both Biden and Harris conceded defeat and congratulated Trump, with efforts underway for the former and now-future president to visit the White House – all things Trump never did in the four years after his loss to Biden.
Biden drew implicit comparisons to the non-transition from four years ago, listing the steps he was taking that were never offered to him when he beat Trump. He also used the moment to again push back on questions of election integrity after years of false allegations from his predecessor — and now successor.
“I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system,” Biden said. “It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent, and it can be trusted – win or lose.”
What comes next for Biden’s policy legacy is uncertain. Trump threatens to withdraw from some of the relationships with foreign powers that Biden had spent years personally developing during his time on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Few of Biden’s signature accomplishments can’t be undone by his successor.
In his speech, Biden suggested the true scope of his legacy won’t be known for years.
“Much of the work we’ve done is already being felt by the American people but the vast majority of it will not be felt – it’ll be felt over the next 10 years,” he said.
Yet as much as Biden could be remembered for his infrastructure law, his student-loan forgiveness program or his leadership through the country’s recovery from the pandemic, his legacy may hinge as much on how history judges his decision to stay in the race for as long as he did, depriving Harris of the chance to introduce herself to the country much earlier.
Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who served as co-chair of both Biden and Harris 2024 campaigns and is one of the most outspoken supporters of the president, told CNN the day after the election that he was prepared to defend his friend from any Democratic finger-pointing.
“The Biden administration got a huge amount done, as you’ve heard me recite with great frequency. I do think the party has some soul-searching to do,” Coons said.
After ticking off policies that he said were widely popular that the Biden administration should be credited for – including lowering the prices of prescription drugs and investing in infrastructure projects – the senator lamented: “But (voters) do not recognize that that’s what he got done. So we need to think about how we communicate that.”
But if aides and allies of the president are eager to publicly defend Biden and his work, frustration is boiling over across the Democratic Party on his decision to seek a second term – despite his initial promise to be a “transition” and “bridge” candidate.
Had he stepped aside in the middle of his first term, the party would have had a chance to hold a primary contest and nominate their strongest candidate, they say – whether that would have ultimately ended up being Harris, or not.
“He should have stepped aside sooner,” said one former Biden administration official, before adding: “I just don’t know if that would have mattered.”
A senior Harris campaign official, who said they do not believe a competitive Democratic primary process would have put Harris at the top of the ticket this cycle, told CNN they blamed Biden’s own ego – and all of his top advisers who shot down any suggestion from Democrats that the party needed new leadership.
“The lack of a competitive process for a replacement; that he didn’t allow for that to happen – people are still angry about the shunning that they took for speaking out earlier about him,” the official said.
But Biden addressed none of those recriminations in the Rose Garden on Thursday. Yet even as he sought to project a sense of optimism during his short remarks, he betrayed a hint of doubt about the future.
“The road ahead is clear,” Biden said, “assuming we sustain it.”

106,General Politics,2024,11,Giuliani given a week to turn over his car and other valuables to women he defamed or face contempt,Katelyn Polantz,"New York
CNN
 — 
Former Donald Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani has until the end of next week to give the lawyers of the women he defamed the keys and title of his classic car, and ship them two dozen watches, furniture and sports memorabilia, or else face contempt sanctions, a federal judge said Thursday.
At a lengthy court hearing in Manhattan, Giuliani grumbled frequently from the defense table and was given firm new orders by the district Judge Lewis Liman on how he must respond to the Georgia election workers to whom he owes nearly $150 million.
Giuliani previously was told by the judge he was to provide Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, the two Georgians he defamed after the 2020 election, many of his most valuable and sentimental possessions by last Tuesday. His lawyer has tried to argue he was ready to provide the items and just didn’t know how.
In court, Liman warned that Giuliani could be held in contempt and sanctioned “if he hasn’t delivered and there’s a way in which he could have delivered.”
“The law is the law. I don’t apply it differently to your client,” Liman said to Giuliani’s attorney, Kenneth Caruso.
Several times the judge asked Caruso to speak with Giuliani, who sat at the defense table, hunched over, shaking his head and whispering exasperations loudly enough to be heard on the microphone in front of him.
Caruso prompted a tense moment with the judge after he accused Moss and Freeman of being “vindictive” of winning Giuliani’s grandfather’s watch as part of the judge’s orders.
Liman responded, “Come on. That’s ridiculous … if (others in his court) owe a debt, they have to pay a debt.”

At one point, Giuliani himself stood up to tell the judge he wanted his name removed from a sworn statement he signed that listed him as the only person who knew where his assets were.
Liman said it was “farcical” Giuliani didn’t know where his possessions were – including the ones that he previously said he had and now needs to turn over.
Giuliani then said he didn’t want to provide names of others who knew where his items were located, because he believed they were being “tortured” by lawyers.
“You don’t have the right to exercise self-help,” Liman responding, ordering the mayor to answer “truthfully and fully” who had knowledge of where his things were.
In court, Giuliani’s attorney has said some of his possessions, like his approximately two dozen luxury watches and jewelry, and some expensive furniture, is in his $3.5 million Palm Beach condo – where Giuliani says he now lives and is fighting Moss and Freeman to hold onto.
Some of the items as well as sports memorabilia including a Joe DiMaggio-signed jersey is in a storage unit on Long Island, where the manager is currently unreachable because he is out of town for a month, court filings say.
Moss and Freeman’s team are also in the process of taking possession of Giuliani’s $6 million Manhattan condo, which was nearly empty when they gained access to it last week and they intend to sell.
At one point in the court hearing, Giuliani’s attorney brought up the timing of Moss and Freeman’s pursuits – with the hearing happening two days after Trump’s reelection. Giuliani continues to support Trump publicly but says he wasn’t paid about $2 million for the work he did for Trump’s campaign in 2020.
Moss and Freeman’s legal team are now able to pursue that amount too, from Trump, and said Thursday they may try to take it to court.
After the hearing, when asked by CNN if he hoped Trump would help him, Giuliani said, “Mr. Trump doesn’t have to help me get out of it. All he has to do is straighten out the legal system, and you’ll find that bringing this case was a complete abuse of process.”
He added: “The $145 million judgment to anyone sensible is ridiculous, obviously punitive, obviously done because I’m a Republican.”

107,General Politics,2024,11,"Trump attorney’s phone tapped by Chinese hackers, sources tell CNN",Paula Reid,"CNN
 — 
The FBI has informed one of President-elect Donald Trump’s lead attorneys that his cellphone was tapped by Chinese hackers, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN, as part of a wide-ranging operation targeting top Republicans and Democrats in US politics that has been underway for months.
The FBI informed the attorney, Todd Blanche, last week that the hackers were able to obtain some voice recordings and text messages from his phone, but that none of the information was related to Trump, one of the sources said. The FBI provided Blanche, who has had to start using a different number after the breach, what the hackers obtained, including communications with family, the source said.
CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment.
Blanche is the second of two Trump attorneys believed to be targeted by foreign hackers. CNN reported in August that attorney Lindsey Halligan was targeted as part of a separate Iranian hacking effort, though the timing of that attempt and the extent of any breach of her devices or accounts remains unclear.
Chinese hackers have also targeted other top figures in Trump’s orbit, including Trump himself and the vice president-elect, Sen. JD Vance. Other targets included Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Eric Trump, members of the Harris-Walz campaign and members of the Biden administration, CNN previously reported.
The sophisticated hacking effort has unnerved national security officials because of the deep access that the Chinese hackers have gotten to prominent Americans’ call and phone records.
US officials investigating the hacking campaign, which came via intrusions at US telecom firms AT&T, Lumen and Verizon, consider it to be among the most concerning national security-related hacks in recent memory.
The scope of the hack is “way worse than the public knows,” and officials are still sifting through the intrusions to determine the impact, another source familiar with the intelligence previously told CNN.
The Chinese government has denied US allegations that it is behind the hack.
The Chinese spies have forced US government employees to take unusual security precautions. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, for example, has directed its employees to only use Microsoft Teams and Cisco WebEx to conduct work-related business involving non-public information, a CFPB spokesperson told CNN on Thursday.
There is no evidence that the CFPB has been specifically targeted by the hackers, the spokesperson said. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the CFPB security protocol.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/politics/trump-attorney-phone-tapped-chinese-hackers/index.html

CNN
 — 
It’s been called the “red mirage” or the “blue shift.”
It’s the recent phenomenon by which an apparent Republican lead early after polls close on election night is erased by the counting of mail-in ballots later in the evening or in the days after Election Day.
Former President Donald Trump has pointed to the red mirage to back up his baseless allegations of election fraud, when in fact it has been a function of the rise of mail-in voting and the often-peculiar rules about when those ballots can be counted.
What happened in 2020?
When most Americans went to bed on election night in 2020, on November 3, the end result was far from clear.
The contest between then-President Trump and now-President Joe Biden was still too early to call in the key states of Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Georgia and Pennsylvania.
The following days would include dramatic hours spent watching the counting of votes in these states. The vote count didn’t reflect a Biden lead in Georgia until early in the morning of November 6, when, as CNN’s Phil Mattingly showed viewers on the Magic Wall, small batches of votes were being counted and affecting the very close election.
CNN was able to project that Biden would win the election four days after Election Day, on November 7, but counting would continue. An analysis by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that counties won by Biden counted slower, on average, than counties won by Trump.
There was also a blue shift in 2016, but it was not decisive. As CNN’s Marshall Cohen wrote, when Hillary Clinton offered her concession, she was still behind in the popular vote. While the trickle-in of ballots was not enough to get her the White House, it was more than enough to give her an edge of millions of ballots in the popular vote.
In 2020, the slowest-counting states were places like California, which are heavily Democratic and where every registered voter is sent a mail-in ballot. That means a blue shift in the popular vote could still occur even if it does not delay figuring out the presidential election results.
It’s important to remember that while news networks like CNN might project a winner when it is clear who will win, the races are not officially certified until later. Certification deadlines vary from state to state, but they all have until December 11, 2024, to complete recounts, if needed, and settle disputes around presidential results.

How long will it take this year?
There is some indication that things could go quicker in some key states.
In Georgia, a new election law means more people will vote early in person rather than by mail, which could speed up the process of counting mail-in ballots. North Carolina no longer accepts mail-in ballots if they arrive after Election Day.

What to expect in the sprint to Election Day – and beyond
The Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks election-related laws, has a rundown of potential choke points.
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said recently on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he expects the vast majority of ballots to be processed and counted in the hours after polls close.
“All early votes and all early accepted ballots, they all will have to have their results reported by 8 p.m. That’s 70, maybe even 75% of all the vote totals will be reported no later than 8 p.m. on election night,” he said. But if the election in Georgia is as close in 2024 as it was in 2020, the outcome may still not be clear.
Raffensperger was asked if it could take a week to determine the winner in Georgia.
“Absolutely not,” he said. “What we will be waiting for is the overseas ballots that come in no later than Friday, and so those will then be the final numbers. And we’ll just see if that makes the difference in the total vote totals.”

Other states, like the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, have not made it possible for election officials to process any ballots before Election Day. But the count could be faster in those places as well, with more experience and fewer ballots to handle when compared with the pandemic-era 2020 election. The Center for Election Innovation & Research has a rundown of the various rules and timelines for processing mail-in ballots.
In Michigan, another key state where processing of ballots can occur before Election Day, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was also asked by CBS about how long it will take to count ballots. Benson, a Democrat, said she hopes to know the outcome by the end of Wednesday, November 6, a day after polls close.
“We will always prioritize accuracy and security over efficiency,” she said.
Close elections can take time to figure out
In the event of tight margins, it could still take days.
The top elections official in Pennsylvania is Republican Al Schmidt, who told NPR recently that people need to trust the system in the period after polls close.
“In 2020 … we saw that window of time between the polls being closed at 8 p.m. on election night and the race being called as a period of vulnerability where people were seeking to undermine confidence in the results,” he said, noting that in the end, after all the votes were counted, the Pennsylvania results were not that close.
The closest elections can take time, as anyone who is old enough to remember 2000 can attest. A close election in Florida was paired with a flawed punch-ballot system that left some ballots with “hanging chads” up for debate.
The outcome of the election that year dragged on for more than a month – 36 days until the US Supreme Court halted a partial Florida recount and essentially handed the election to George W. Bush. Then-Vice President Al Gore conceded on December 13 and then became one of just three vice presidents to oversee the counting of electoral votes in their own defeat. Harris could be the fourth. Or the first since George H.W. Bush to oversee their own victory.
In the same way that no one knows who will win the 2024 election, it’s also not entirely clear how long determining the winner this year will take.

Former President Donald Trump and one of his most vocal supporters, tech billionaire Elon Musk, have alleged without evidence that the potential for voter fraud is a major threat.
RELATED ARTICLE
The 2024 election, explained
For instance, Trump has claimed, without providing proof, that there is “cheating” in Pennsylvania. Musk has used X to spread unfounded allegations about voting systems, laying groundwork to question the election before it happens.
Voting is ultimately an act of faith in democracy, and undercutting the system, despite all the evidence to the contrary, is clearly a strategy on the part of Trump’s allies.
To better understand the security of US voting systems and why there’s no indication that they’re not secure, I talked to CNN’s Zachary Cohen, who covers national security, and Sean Lyngaas, who covers cybersecurity. They’re both part of a larger team of reporters at CNN who are focused on election security.
Our conversation, edited for clarity, is below:
Let’s start with Dominion Voting Systems
WOLF: The company most people have heard of is Dominion, which won a $787 million settlement with Fox News related to 2020 election lies. How much of the country uses Dominion? And are there alternatives?
LYNGAAS: A big portion of the country, numerous states, use Dominion in some form. There are three large election equipment vendors in the US: Dominion; ES&S, or Election Systems and Software; and Hart InterCivic. They constitute the vast majority of election infrastructure. You cover a big portion of the country with that.
However, there are a lot of other smaller vendors. Dominion is very, very common, but in a given election office, I think you have multiple vendors. They’re not putting all their chips in one basket, so if something catastrophic were to happen, they have a backup plan.

How does the process work?
WOLF: How does the process of voting generally work with these systems?
LYNGAAS: You have different equipment that handles the voter registration database, so when you show up on voting day or whenever you go to vote, they can compare what’s in that voter registration to what’s in front of them in terms of their records.
About 97% of votes are cast with a paper record. Federal officials, election officials are using that as a point of reference to try to convince people that their vote is secure and accurate, which it is.
Voting machines – some are a touch tablet where you have a panel, and you make your choice and print that out. In other systems, a voter fills out the ballot with a pen and then feeds it into a voting machine.
COHEN: There’s a common misconception that the voting machines are the complete process. In reality, they’re one part of a bigger system that goes into casting, then storing and counting votes. In a lot of states, a county will transfer the data they get from the machines themselves via USB and go manually plug that into a computer.
All that data is then gathered and collected online by the secretary of states or by whoever is in charge, ultimately, of preserving that data. Then there is obviously the paper ballot part of it, which is more about reassuring the voter, but also can be used as an audit tool as well.
How are things different this year?
WOLF: What are the consequential changes that we’ve seen since 2020?
COHEN: The biggest thing has been a sort of war over what is fact and what is fiction as it relates to voting machines. Because of the prevalence of Dominion systems specifically, that’s the reason why these purveyors of disinformation have really harped on Dominion and alleged a lot of conspiracies about vote flipping.
We’re seeing a lot of those same narratives resurface now. Because Dominion is used across so many different states, if you highlight an alleged problem with one system in one state, you could then make an argument that it’s impacting the entire vote across the country.
That’s what we’ve seen – these pro-Trump operatives and lawyers trying to argue ahead of 2024 that these systems are unreliable, that there’s already evidence that they’re being manipulated. But there is no evidence that votes have been flipped or that somebody has hacked these systems already or in past elections – so it’s sort of a war about truth rather than a war about the system themselves.
What are the protections?
WOLF: If you’re talking about USB ports and hard drives, that’s pretty low-tech. What are the guarantees these systems are secure? What are the precautions against hacking?
LYNGAAS: One of the main precautions is the chain of custody over the data. With the exception last cycle of the Coffee County (Georgia) break-in, where you had people who were authorized to have access to the facility let someone in.
That’s hopefully a rare exception, because 99.9% of the people running elections don’t do that. It’s closely guarded who has access to the tabulators and the backend data that’s used to make sure all the voters are in the system, and then the paper trail is probably the biggest safeguard.
COHEN: I think it’s really important to note that something that has changed since 2020 is that we’ve learned there are legitimate concerns about vulnerabilities, particularly when it comes to the backend part of the voting system.
Sean was referencing the break-in the Coffee County Elections Office, where an election worker gave people who didn’t have authorization access to those systems – basically unfettered access to copy the entire software platform that that county was using. We saw something similar in Mesa County, Colorado.
We’ve seen in Michigan, these pro-Trump operatives and lawyers spent the last four years trying to get access to these systems that they are not supposed to have access to.
In Georgia, we’ve already seen local Republican officials cite not just the Coffee County data and election software that they were able to copy as part of a lawsuit, raising questions preemptively about the validity of the 2024 count. But we’ve seen them imply and suggest the vulnerabilities themselves are reason enough to file lawsuits and ultimately signal that they intend to use that to challenge the outcome if Trump loses.
LYNGAAS: All software has vulnerabilities, but we still don’t have any evidence that a vulnerability in Dominion software, or any other software, has been exploited in any election to cause any kind of impact.
The other thing I’d say is that not just since 2020, but in years prior too, there’s been what we call penetration testing of a lot of this equipment. An election vendor, whether it be ES&S or Dominion or Hart, they’ll send it out to Idaho National Labs, for one, which is under the Department of Energy, where they have some of the smartest cyber people in the game. And they’ll break apart the system and see what vulnerabilities do exist out there.
Election security advocates have wanted that type of program to step up more, and to be highlighted and to be front and center. It’s still going on.
But in this post-2020 environment, when you talk about any kind of vulnerability in the system, it gets weaponized in terms of how people consume that information. I’m a cybersecurity reporter, and I love covering when there is a vulnerability and it’s fixed and it’s a good news story. But people don’t see the good news for what it is.
The last thing I’d say in terms of a reassurance to folks is that a lot of these software flaws that are found in some voting equipment, to be able to take advantage of them, you often need to be standing right near the machine. People would see something going on. So that helps.
I think unfortunately, the public dialogue has been poisoned by this notion that any kind of flaw is proof of fraud, which is just absolutely false. I can’t say that enough.
What’s behind the misinformation?
WOLF: Somebody like Elon Musk is smart enough to know that there’s no evidence of this stuff, but he continues to push the conspiracy theories. What do we think is to be gained from undercutting people’s faith in the system?
COHEN: All the evidence to this point suggests that effort is almost entirely geared toward preemptively sowing doubt about the process itself, so that if Donald Trump or if Kamala Harris wanted, they could use that as the basis of post-election litigation.
Say they lose a key swing state, or any key swing states, because they all do use Dominion systems – it’s about creating a record that allows them to potentially file lawsuits to call the outcome of the election into question.
One of the vulnerabilities that is real but hasn’t actually been exploited in a previous election: there’s really no way to know. They don’t really need to prove that these vulnerabilities were manipulated or exploited. They just need to create enough doubt in the process to give a judge pause.
WOLF: At the end of the day, casting a ballot is an act of faith in the system.
2020 audits found nothing
COHEN: Think about the Maricopa audit after the 2020 election. That went on for months after January 6 (2021). That was funded by right-wing MAGA dark money groups with the intention of proving this theory that Trump actually won Arizona, and at the end of the day, Doug Logan and the Cyber Ninjas proved the opposite, that (Joe) Biden won.
LYNGAAS: It gets less attention that they found nothing and they validated the outcome.
On Musk, he has turned to this issue with all the platform that he has – hundreds of millions of followers on the platform that he owns, and it’s causing real problems for people who run elections and people who are trying to get the truth out.
Stephen Richer, the county recorder in Maricopa County, Arizona, has tried to tweet at Musk to try to just pierce, to put a little dent in the massive noise of conspiracies that (Musk is) putting out. Richer told CNN he has tried to get intermediaries to pass Musk notes about the integrity of elections, to no avail. No one’s been able to change Musk’s mind.
COHEN: You talk about something that’s changed since 2020. In 2020, we didn’t have the CEO and owner of one of the most used social media platforms pick a side and have a stated political agenda in what view he’s amplifying – not just through his own account, but through the algorithm of his platform. He’s on Team Trump, and so therefore everything that he is amplifying and pushing out there should be viewed within that context.
What needs to change?
WOLF: You said there are natural vulnerabilities for any system. What are the vulnerabilities that are making election officials nervous, or what are the ones that need to be addressed?
LYNGAAS: In an ideal world, there would be a robust pipeline of this, where we would be finding and fixing them. That’s still happening, but people are much more reluctant to talk about it publicly because of the way it gets distorted and weaponized.
The short answer to your question is: I don’t know of any glaring software vulnerability in election infrastructure that hasn’t been addressed.
COHEN: At the same time, though, we can’t ignore the reality that we’ve learned since 2020 that election officials themselves, even if it’s a very, very small percentage of them, are susceptible to the same misinformation / disinformation narratives as you and I are. It’s been proven out that some election officials will take it upon themselves to do things that they’re not supposed to do in the name of that disinformation.
LYNGAAS: Yeah, I think the biggest threat is an insider threat. When you have someone who wants to subvert the process, that’s a huge problem, and so you’re reliant on their colleagues speaking up. Or if it gets to criminal behavior, the FBI being aware of it and investigating it.
Everyone I talk to says the sentencing of Tina Peters to nine years in Colorado could be a huge deterrent. If you listen to the judge, it’s almost like he was talking to someone else when he was sentencing, that it was a message for anyone else who would do that, because that’s where the really serious harm comes in.
COHEN: We know people, these pro-Trump operatives and lawyers, have already gotten access to election software – voting software, voting systems in Georgia, copied the entire election database from several counties.
But at the end of the day, they’ve proven that the access itself can be used, regardless of whether they can prove it’s been exploited, to file this post-election litigation and basically try to cast the entire process into chaos. That’s the thing people need to be aware of.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/politics/voting-systems-security-what-matters/index.html
110,General Politics,2024,11,Why these are the five (or six) states to watch on election night,Harry Enten,"CNN
 — 
The 2024 presidential election isn’t a race for student council president.
And it’s not just because one of the candidates is 60 years old (Kamala Harris) and the other is about two years shy of 80 (Donald Trump). It’s because, as Democrats Hillary Clinton and Al Gore know, the national popular vote does not determine the winner.
The only thing that matters is getting to 270 electoral votes through the Electoral College. This year, if you know the winner(s) in these five states — Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and perhaps a sixth, Arizona — you’ll know which candidate has gotten there.
Why is it these five or six states? They all by far have seen the closest polling, and each is worth at least 10 electoral votes.
Let’s start with some basics: 226 electoral votes can be found in the states — along with Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District and Washington, DC — where Harris has had a clear lead over Trump. Meanwhile, 219 electoral votes seem to be leaning in the former president’s direction.
We take these places off the board because one of the candidates is ahead by 5 points or more in almost all of them.
Now, there’s always the chance of another state shocking us. If Ann Selzer’s Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll released this past weekend is right, Iowa could be that state. The survey showed Harris at 47% to Trump’s 44% — a finding within the margin of error in a state the former president won by high single digits in both 2016 and 2020.
Of course, if that poll is anywhere close to being right, chances are Harris will do well enough in the battleground states to easily capture at least 270 electoral votes.
Closing off the ‘blue wall’
Looking at those battleground states, Harris has the easier path than Trump to getting to 270 electoral votes. She could win by corralling Michigan (15 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes) and Wisconsin (10 electoral votes). Victories in those three “blue wall” states would get her to exactly 270.
The polling in these three states is close. An average of recent polling shows Harris with the smallest of advantages in Michigan and Wisconsin (about a point), and the two candidates tied in Pennsylvania. (Other averages might have her slightly further ahead or even slightly behind in those states.)

It isn’t a surprise that Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are Harris’ best states of the remaining important ones. These are the three states that Clinton lost by the smallest margin in 2016, and all three helped put Joe Biden over the top in 2020. Harris also seems to be holding up better among White voters than voters of color relative to Biden’s 2020 performance. These states have the highest percentage of White voters of the current battleground states.
But polls are not perfect. Trump could easily win one or more of these three states. Let’s say he wins one of them. Harris could still get to 270 electoral votes by adding another state to her column.
Through the Southern Sun Belt
No state has had more consecutive presidential elections decided by less than 5 points than North Carolina at four straight cycles. And the Tar Heel State is likely to be quite competitive again. Trump seems to have an advantage of about a point in North Carolina right now, according to an average of recent polls.
Importantly, the state has 16 electoral votes. This means that Harris could lose either Michigan or Wisconsin, and easily substitute in North Carolina.
The same holds true for Georgia. The Peach State has 16 electoral votes. So why does North Carolina rank ahead of Georgia for me in terms of importance?
After all, Biden won Georgia in 2020, while he lost North Carolina to Trump by a point. The simple explanation is that the polling has been closer in North Carolina this time around. Trump’s been ahead by 1 to 2 points, per the average of Georgia polling over the past few weeks.
And given that the Democratic base in each of these Southern states is highly reliant on Black and college-educated voters, chances are high that any polling error in one state would be seen in the other, too. In other words, Harris would likely have a better chance at winning North Carolina than she would Georgia.
That said, we don’t know for sure that Georgia will vote to the right of North Carolina. And if Harris loses Wisconsin, along with either Michigan or Pennsylvania, she would need both Southern states to get to 270 electoral votes.

A test in the West
You’ll note that I haven’t spoken about either Arizona (the sixth state I teased earlier) or Nevada (a battleground state where the current polling is very tight).
In the case of Arizona, the reason is a combination of two factors: the closeness of the polls and the number of electoral votes. Trump’s strongest state in the battleground polling has been Arizona. He’s up by about 2 points on average over Harris. That’s within any margin of error, but it still makes the state somewhat less appetizing for the vice president.
Additionally, Arizona has 11 electoral votes. Michigan and Pennsylvania both have more. If Harris lost either one, substituting Arizona would not be enough to get her to 270 electoral votes. You’d need another state plus Arizona.
Arizona does at least have more electoral votes than Wisconsin. You cannot say that about Nevada, however, which has just six electoral votes.
While I can draw up scenarios under which Nevada would determine the winner, they would be few and far between. So even though polling in the Silver State is close (within a point), the electoral math lines up in such a way that only in a rare scenario would Nevada truly make the difference.
Of course, knowing how crazy our politics have been, we can’t dismiss the electoral map. But the bottom line is this election is most likely going to come down to five states … or maybe six.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/politics/states-to-watch-election-night/index.html
111,General Politics,2024,11,What we learned from 15 months talking to America’s most crucial voters,John King,"Swarthmore, Pennsylvania
CNN
 — 
Shannon Elliott and Kristin Caparra live in the same suburban Philadelphia county. Both are a mix of anxious and excited this Election Day. Both see their country at a defining crossroads.
The common ground ends there.
“I’m worried about a Trump presidency,’’ said Elliott, a mother of two teenagers and owner of a gift shop in Swarthmore. “I don’t want to go back there.”
Caparra worries, too.
“When I think about Kamala Harris, I think what annoys me most is her duality, where she says her values haven’t changed,” said Caparra, a civil engineer from Drexel Hill who also teaches figure skating. “That’s almost like a signal to the extreme left that I am still very much a progressive. And a progressive, in my mind, is a name for, you know, the Democratic Socialist Party. So, she’s playing to the left-most fringe.”
Swarthmore and Drexel Hill are just six miles apart in Delaware County. Yet Elliott and Caparra are on opposite sides of America’s cavernous political divide. Former President Donald Trump is its lightning rod.
Elliott: “I see how he treats people and bullies people, and these are things I tell my teenage kids not to do. Why would I want to see my president doing that.”

All Over The Map: The Pennsylvania Voters Who May Decide the Race
With just hours before election day, we’re returning to a handful of people who represent a crucial voter segment: unhappy Pennsylvania Republicans. John King interviews three people who voted for Nikki Haley in the state’s primary back in the spring — long after she’d dropped out. How they and others like them fill out their ballots this week may decide the next president of the United States.
Nov 05, 2024 • 35 min
...
Caparra: “I wish they could, quite honestly, get over some of Trump’s bad behavior and look at the broader sense of what he means. … He loves this country and my version of this country a little more dearly than the other side, to be honest.”
Elliott and Caparra are two of the nearly 90 voters we have spent time with over the past 15 months as we visited 10 states for our All Over the Map project. The goal was to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battleground states or are part of critical voting blocs. Or both.
We learned so much and owe so much to the Americans who invited us into their homes and workplaces and communities. What we learned most is that the voters are way ahead of the politicians.
From our first trip to our last, they brought to life the issues that would most animate the campaign. The cost of living. Border security and immigration. Abortion rights and broader questions about reproductive rights and respect for women. Anxiety about technology, globalization and the coarseness of our political debate.
Concerns about President Joe Biden’s age and stamina came up frequently and well before those conversations became common in Washington. We quickly and then constantly were reminded that Trump’s support is more diverse and more complicated than most of his critics understand.
If the former president wins, Caparra’s “my version of this country” comment could be instructive.
Diehard Trump supporters see him as their voice, and they echo his often harsh language about immigrants as well as his lies about stolen and rigged elections and the prosecutions against him.
Holding their noses and voting Trump
But we also met many Trump critics who in the end will be Trump voters because they say Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats pose a greater threat than Trump’s toxic behavior.
Shanen Ebersole fits there.
She is a cattle farmer in southwest Iowa who supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the Iowa caucuses. She was hopeful at the beginning that Republicans would move on from Trump and the behavior she said filled her liberal friends with fear.
But Trump coasted to the nomination and will get Ebersole’s vote on Tuesday because she sees Harris as an activist liberal.
“She is willing to push her agendas on those of us who live a totally different life,” Ebersole said.
Economic concerns dominate
If Trump wins, voters like Joseph Knowles and Brian McMutuary will be part of his comeback math too.
Knowles is a Black union autoworker in Michigan who has never voted Republican for president. But he believes Biden-Harris clean energy policies are hurting the automobile industry and that Democrats are too cozy with cultural elites and too soft on illegal immigration.
“We’ve voted the same way – with Democrats – all our lives and nothing is changing,” Knowles said. “So let’s try something different.”
Michigan voter Joseph Knowles talks to John King in Macomb County. CNN
McMutuary is also Black and also was a lifelong Democrat until he voted for Trump in 2020. He disagrees with Trump on abortion and immigration but sees him as a stronger leader on the world stage and remembers prices as lower when Trump was president.
“When I go to the grocery store, I get what I need, not so much what I want or what the kids want,” said McMutuary, who manages a fast-food restaurant in the Milwaukee suburbs. “We have a budget, you know. It is tight.”
The issue terrain certainly favors the party out of presidential power this year. Biden’s approval rating is under water and voters are pessimistic about the state of the economy and the direction of the country.
Tamara Varga, a Republican and one-time Libertarian who lives in Tucson, Arizona, said she believes Trump will grow his support among Latino voters this time.
“The border and the economy,” she said. “People are having a hard time putting food on their table and gas in their cars, and it’s really affecting them. So I think that they now think about their vote and how it will affect their household.”
The importance of female voters this year
That the election looks so close speaks volumes about Trump and a brand that many voters think is toxic and too unpresidential.
“To me, I think it’s very important to remember a president is a role model. It is very important,” said Suresh Sharma, a Georgia independent who voted for Trump in 2016 then Biden in 2020. “Can I tell my daughter and son, ‘Hey, be like this person’? … So in my view, I think the Republican Party should have done a better job of picking somebody who really reflects American values.”
John King talks with Georgia voter Lakeysha Hallmon at the Village Retail in downtown Atlanta. CNN
If Harris wins, women will be the foundation of her coalition.
Black women are vital in all of the battlegrounds.
Atlanta entrepreneur Lakeysha Hallmon said the switch from Biden to Harris changed everything.
“There’s a sense of joy, a sense of excitement,” Hallmon said. “I think there has been a groundswell of support. … It doesn’t feel so doomsday anymore. It actually feels hopeful when there’s excitement.”
Shannon Elliott, the small businesswoman in suburban Philadelphia, is another piece of the Harris math. If the vice president loses some ground with Black and Latino men, higher support among suburban women is a way to make it up.
“You know we get called ‘woke,’” Elliott said of liberal Swarthmore. “What’s wrong with woke? Why are you asleep? Why are you not awake and seeing that people are going to get hurt and that his behavior just brings negative behavior to the surface and that could be dangerous, very dangerous.”
Republicans looking to save their party
And if Harris wins, it will be because a decent share of Republicans who tried to stop Trump from winning the nomination are prepared to vote for Harris in an effort to stop him from winning the White House.
“My hope is he loses, and he just fades into the annals of history and we move on,” said Michael Pesce, a Haley turned Harris voter from Bucks County in the Philadelphia suburbs.
Pennsylvania Voter Michael Pesce talks to John King in New Tripoli, Pennsylvania. CNN
A Harris win would also likely highlight the strength of the Democratic turnout operation.
“We’ve done all we could,” said Angela Lang, executive director of Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, a progressive group on Milwaukee’s north side.
The 2020 experience looms large over the final days of this year’s campaign.
Many Trump voters echo their candidate in saying the only way for Harris to win is through fraud.
“I don’t think she has a chance to win in a fair fight,” said Chris Mudd, who runs a solar energy company in Cedar Falls, Iowa. “I just don’t believe it is possible. I really don’t. … Many like me would think the same thing: If Kamala Harris gets 81 million votes, something really went haywire.”
Trump critics, on the other hand, are bracing for a repeat of 2020 if he loses again.
“He’s never going to concede that he loses anything,’” said Pesce, the Pennsylvania Haley supporter who is voting for Harris.
Attorney Joan London is another Haley voter turned Harris voter. Like Pesce, she’s a Reagan Republican who believes Trump must lose again to create an opening to return the GOP to its conservative roots.
London believes the legal challenges could drag on for weeks. But she is ready for the campaigning to end.
“I’m so sick of the political ads,” she said. “I wish they would go back to the prescription drug commercials.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/05/politics/battleground-state-voters-2024/index.html
112,General Politics,2024,10,Why these Republicans think voting against Trump could save the GOP,John King,"New Tripoli, Pennsylvania
CNN
 — 
Michael Pesce is conservative in the truest sense of the word.
He speaks with an economy of words. He holds himself to a high standard but prefers not to judge others. He gets through tasks methodically, wasting no time or energy – even when enjoying his hobbies.
Pesce is a hunter, and Pennsylvania deer season overlaps with election season. Archery hunting is open now, with a rifle hunting period set to open in November. So Pesce stopped by the ranges at a state park recently to check his gear.
“Hunting season is starting,” Pesce said. “That’s more important than any election for a lot of people.”
First, several shots at the archery targets, where Pesce at one point used a dime to adjust his bow sight. Once satisfied, it was down to the nearby firearm area. Pesce set his target 100 yards down range, and set his .30-6 hunting rifle on its stand.
A few stalls down, two men were firing AR-15-style assault rifles. Dozens of shots, the empty shells piling up at their feet. Pesce quietly made note of how loud it was, then got about his business: just three shots to adjust his rifle scope, then two more to allow a visitor to test his aim and get a feel for the rifle.
Then time to pack up, taking even the empty shells Pesce recycles for new bullets. A Coast Guard veteran. A Reagan Republican. A Nikki Haley voter in the April GOP primary who will be a Kamala Harris voter a week from Tuesday.
Pesce’s conservative principles tell him he can never vote for Donald Trump. And they tell him he has to vote for Harris, to try to keep Trump out of the White House, even though Pesce doesn’t like surprises and does not believe the vice president has clearly laid out a governing vision.
“That’s the scary part,” Pesce said. “I am not voting for a candidate. I’m not voting for a policy. I’m voting against a candidate and policies, and not even all the policies. Just, you know, the unstableness. Some of the things he says are truly scary.”
Pesce is part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of potentially decisive voting blocs.

In Pesce’s case, he’s one of the Republicans in the counties that surround Philadelphia who supported Haley in the primary even though the former South Carolina governor had exited the race weeks before. They’re voters who view Trump as anything but conservative or principled. In many cases, they believe Trump must be defeated again to shake their party out of his spell.
“If Trump loses, then I think Republicans will start coming back to what they were,” Pesce said. “Because they won’t have that radical right side. They won’t have the craziness and instability.”
It was our third visit in five months, and Pesce, true to his conservatism, has been consistent: He said in May he would vote for President Joe Biden even as he raised concerns about his age and took issue with some of his agenda. In conversations since the switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, Pesce has made clear he sees a duty to try to block Trump.
He recently traveled West through several states that are reliably Republican. Turning on the TV or the radio was different. He returned to Pennsylvania even more mindful that he lives in the biggest of the presidential battleground prizes.
“No one’s ever been through anything like this,” he said of the 2024 campaign. “Is this an election for Americans, or is this for those seven states?”
It is important to remember our project is anecdotal reporting; the voters we are tracking, in this case Haley primary supporters, are not necessarily representative of the full universe of such voters. Yet they still provide us with valuable and sometimes telling insights. And they live in places that will be critical to the final math of who wins Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes.
This time, we met Pesce at a state range in New Tripoli, which is in blue-collar Lehigh County. He lives a few miles away in Bucks County, which in recent elections has been the most competitive of the suburban collar counties that surround Philadelphia.
Those collar counties represent one of the crucial 2024 math tests: Can Harris hold or build on Biden’s 2020 suburban strength or will Trump claw back at least to his 2016 performance, when he lost the Philadelphia suburbs but by a smaller margin than in 2020? In a state so competitive, tiny shifts can make the difference.
‘American first, conservative second and Republican third’
Joan London and Berks County offer another glimpse at the battlegrounds within the battlegrounds.
Berks is still red when you look at election maps, and it is too far out to be considered a Philadelphia suburb. But as the suburbs grow and change, often the exurbs do, too. Still farmland, but more given up to homes and services. Still plenty of Trump signs, but in some pockets surprising competition.
“This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs,” said London, an attorney who was born closer to Philly, in Montgomery County. “This is a primarily Republican leaning borough, always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.”
A walk down London’s leafy street in Wyomissing proves her point. No Trump signs but Harris signs on several of the lawns on her block.
Not her house. London’s lawn has one sign supporting a Republican legislative candidate.
But London is voting for Harris – the first time she will vote Democrat for president.
“Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second and Republican third,” London said.
Pennsylvania voter Joan London talks with John King in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. CNN
Her decision is a shift from when we first met in May. Then, London told us she voted in the GOP primary for Haley but then switched her registration to independent because she opposes Trump and what she sees as his dangerous populism.
But back then she said she would write in a conservative because she could not support Biden. She was even more firm in that belief just after Harris took over the ticket because she views the vice president as more liberal than Biden.
She had settled on Pat Toomey, a conservative former senator from Pennsylvania, as her write-in choice. Then she watched the Trump-Harris debate, and it stirred why, back at the age of 18, she chose to be a Reagan Republican.
“The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine,” London said. “When he said we have to have a negotiated settlement. … For someone who claims to be a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It’s appeasement. It’s dangerous.”
She slept on what that debate answer stirred in her. And she awoke a Harris voter because, like Pesce, she believes the only way to get her party back is for Trump to be defeated.
“I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again,” London said. She knows the polling in Pennsylvania and other swing states is tight and that Trump could well win.
“I don’t want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that,” London said.
London is reluctant to speak for others but believes she may have company among at least some fellow local conservatives.
“I was surprised by how many people came up to me and kind of whispered, ‘I feel the same way as you do,’” she said. “So I have a feeling there are quite a few private conversations that are occurring behind the scenes in Republican and conservative circles.”
It could matter if London has company. Hillary Clinton lost Berks County by 18,189 votes. Biden lost it, too, but by a slightly smaller margin: 16,841.
That 1,348 vote difference seems tiny, maybe insignificant, when you note that Pennsylvania has more than 9 million registered voters.
But ‘every vote counts’ is not a cliché in the battlegrounds: Trump’s winning margin here in 2016 was just 44,292; Biden’s in 2020 was 81,660.
Never Trump, but not yet Harris
Cynthia Sabatini is another Haley voter who now factors into the battleground math.
She lives in Media, in suburban Delaware County.
Sabatini is a registered Republican but she has never voted for Trump. And she says she never will.
“Trump is a non starter for me,” she said in a recent interview at home.
But she is not sold on Harris, either, and her questions track what we hear from a lot of voters in our travels, even committed supporters of the vice president.
“I don’t know who she is,” Sabatini said. “I really don’t. Because she had different positions than she does now. But she continues to say they are within her value system. So connect the dots for me.”
What can Harris do to win her vote in these final days?
“You need to answer questions on point,” Sabatini said. “You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about your vision for this country.”
Cynthia Sabatini meditates with John King in Media, Pennsylvania. CNN
Sabatini wrote in a Republican senator in 2016 when Trump won Pennsylvania. She voted for Biden in 2020. She is well aware of the 2024 math, and friends voting for Harris aren’t shy about reminding her how critical it is for the vice president to get big margins in the suburbs.
“I don’t care what they personally think about that,” Sabatini said. “I don’t want to be forced into making a decision between one of the two.”
She meditates frequently, sometimes twice a day, and says it can clear the mind for tough choices.
As she ponders hers, she shares this: “I think Trump is going to win.” That, she said, is based on betting lines, not the polls.
Sabatini does not want Trump back in the White House. She has a mail-in ballot and plans to drop it off on Election Day. Her decision could come as late as that morning.
She will make it according to her beliefs: Either Harris will win her over or she will cast another write in, with Haley her leading choice if it comes to that.
“The lion’s share of my friends are Democrats,” she said. “They think at the 11th hour people will have such reservations about Trump that it will cause them to vote for Harris. I don’t see it that way.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/26/politics/pennsylvania-haley-voters-trump-harris/index.html

In the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a number of conservatives and Republicans broke ranks with then-President Donald Trump and blamed him for the violence that day. Among them was Trump’s current campaign manager, Chris LaCivita.
In a series of reposts on X – formerly Twitter – LaCivita shared comments calling January 6 an “insurrection” that was fueled by Trump’s baseless election lies. Some of those posts have since been deleted from LaCivita’s feed, but CNN was able to review them on the Internet Archive WayBack Machine, which archives internet webpages.
On January 6, 2021, LaCivita reposted several posts that harshly condemned Trump, suggesting that even some of his closest allies once viewed the deadly outcome as a direct result of Trump’s lies.
In a statement to CNN, Lacivita said his likes and retweets on January 6 were not supportive statements.
“Retweets and likes are not endorsements. I’m focused on winning the election two weeks from now, and not distractions from CNN,” he said.
LaCivita’s shared posts included a statement on January 6 from former President George W. Bush, who expressed “disbelief and dismay” at the violent assault on the Capitol, calling it “a sickening and heartbreaking sight.”
“I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,” read the statement by Bush that LaCivita shared. “The violent assault on the Capitol – and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress – was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes.”
The post, which was shared on the evening of January 6, was later deleted from LaCivita’s feed.
CNN also reviewed a video showing a screen recording of posts that LaCivita liked on January 6, including one from Republican former Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who called for Trump’s Cabinet to remove him from office via the 25th Amendment.
“Twitter locked @realDonaldTrump for 12 hours. Now the Cabinet needs to lock him down for the next 14 days. #25thAmendmentNow,” Comstock wrote on the evening of January 6.
Although X has since removed the ability to view likes, a user whose tweet was liked by LaCivita confirmed to CNN that his post had indeed been liked by Trump’s campaign manager on January 6.
The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president unfit for office, temporarily transferring power to the vice president.
Another post shared by LaCivita was a stark message from a Republican Senate aide, which John McCormack, then a reporter for the conservative magazine National Review, shared on X.
“Text message from a GOP Senate aide: ‘This is a disgusting tragedy. Someone literally lost their life because of a lie that Trump told, Cruz/Hawley capitalized on, and fringe media echoed. This is in no way shape or form sustainable.’”
Another since-removed post from LaCivita’s feed included a comment calling those who stormed the Capitol “thugs.” The comment from a GOP political staffer linked to a CNN tweet reading, “Pro-Trump protesters have stormed the US Capitol, where members of Congress were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win.”
“They are not protestors. They are thugs,” the post read.

The shared comments by LaCivita, the top staffer for Trump’s quest to retake the White House this November, are notable as the former president in the closing weeks of the campaign has sought to recast the events that day.
On social media, Trump has shared unfounded conspiracies suggesting the riot was an inside job perpetrated by the federal government. He has also called the rally and events preceding it as a day of “love and peace,” and suggested that if he regains the White House, he will pardon January 6 rioters convicted of violent acts that day.
During a Univision town hall last week, Trump defended his supporters’ actions, claiming they stormed the Capitol because they believed the election was “rigged.” He continued to mischaracterize the day’s events, stating, “That was a day of love from the standpoint of the millions.”
Last week, on Truth Social, Trump also shared a post calling January 6 “the day the government staged a riot.”
The unfounded conspiracy theory that the federal government staged the January 6 attack has been widely debunked as baseless.
LaCivita, a longtime Republican political strategist with a career working on high-profile campaigns throughout Virginia and nationally, has served in the role of co-campaign manager for Donald Trump’s third presidential bid with fellow seasoned political operative Susie Wiles since 2023.
He first gained national recognition during the 2004 presidential election for his role in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign, the group that sought to undermine and attack Democratic nominee John Kerry’s military record.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/23/politics/trump-campaign-manager-january-6/index.html
114,General Politics,2024,10,"KFile: Kamala Harris pledged to prosecute oil companies over emissions. Now, she’s praising their record US production",Andrew Kaczynski,"CNN
 — 
When Kamala Harris ran for president in 2019, she repeatedly warned oil companies they should be prepared to face hefty fines and even criminal prosecution under a future Harris administration for their role in contributing to climate change.
Now, as the Democratic nominee, Harris is highlighting the country’s record oil and gas production. She rarely talks about climate change, and, despite having been a vigorous supporter of the Green New Deal, her campaign’s website is light on climate policy details.
It’s a stark shift that illustrates the delicate politics of energy — but also how Harris has abandoned a number of progressive positions she held before joining Joe Biden’s ticket in 2020.
As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris pledged to eliminate the filibuster in order to pass a Green New Deal, with strict deadlines for reducing fossil fuel use. She also signed a pledge to hold all future energy projects accountable to a “climate test” and promised to cancel two pipeline construction projects opposed by environmental activists. She pledged to ban fracking and signed on to niche environmental proposals such as banning plastic straws. And she ran numerous ads on Facebook touting her plans to “take on” the oil lobby and pass a Green New Deal.
“You should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime,” Harris said in November 2019 when a South Carolina town hall attendee asked whether she would investigate companies such as Chevron and Shell for their role in contributing to climate change.
Harris went on to compare the actions of major oil companies to Big Tobacco, accusing them of knowingly profiting from environmental damage while concealing the harm caused by their products.
“And, not unlike the tobacco companies, after years — ’cause they’d done the research — they knew the harm that their product was causing. They were making so much money that they kept that secret — same thing with these big oil companies. And they need to pay the price,” she said. “So yes is the answer.”
Harris made a similar promise when speaking with the liberal Mother Jones magazine a month earlier, saying, “Let’s get them not only in the pocketbook, but let’s make sure there are severe and serious penalties for their behaviors.”
Harris’s shift on energy and climate began after joining the Biden ticket in August 2020 as the vice presidential pick. That year, she reversed her position on wanting to ban fracking, something she’d staked out in a 2019 CNN town hall.
In August of this year, a few weeks after Biden ended his bid for reelection, the Harris campaign said she no longer supports the Green New Deal. She says that she would not ban fracking and that she no longer wants to ban plastic straws.
In a local interview last month in Pennsylvania, Harris once again was forced to defend her record on wanting to ban fracking when asked about a Republican ad that highlighted her past comments.
“So let me start by saying that that ad as you described it is absolutely a mischaracterization, which I think is intended to make people afraid,” Harris replied. “I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president.”
Record US oil production
Campaigning in Philadelphia last month, Harris pointed to the Biden administration’s record on increasing domestic oil production, telling voters, “We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil.”
The US energy industry is currently producing more oil than any country in history, though energy advocacy groups have said the surge is driven by market forces, not Biden’s policies.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has imposed regulatory fines on oil companies for environmental violations, including a $241.5 million settlement with Marathon Oil and a $40 million settlement with BP for air pollution charges. The actions target specific issues, such as methane emissions, but were driven more by regulatory enforcement than by the sweeping prosecutions Harris once proposed
At the same time, climate change is not a top priority for many voters. According to Gallup, only 50% of voters view climate change as “extremely” or “very important” to their vote, making it one of the least prioritized issues in this election cycle.
Mia Ehrenberg, a Harris campaign spokesperson, highlighted the Democratic presidential nominee’s support addressing for climate change and while also praising American energy production hitting record levels.
“As president, Kamala Harris will be pragmatic to address the threat of climate change and ensure America does not forfeit the clean energy economy and industries of the future. She is proud to have been the tie-breaking vote on the largest climate action in American history, while seeing American energy production of all kinds hit record levels. As Attorney General of California, she took on polluters to protect our environment and will do the same as president.”
A climate hawk
Archived material from Harris’s 2020 campaign found more than a dozen mentions of prosecuting Big Oil either for pollution or climate change. Citing climate change as an urgent threat, Harris said aggressive action was imminently needed.
In one November 2019 campaign event in Iowa, Harris blamed the fossil fuel industry for the climate crisis, comparing it to Big Tobacco companies’ history of pushing misinformation despite knowing the harm they were causing.
“They had done the studies and they knew of the harm that their product was creating, but they still pushed their product ’cause they were making a ton of money. That’s the same thing with Big Oil. They’ve known for a long time what they’ve been doing that is destroying this God-given planet,” she said.
At times, Harris highlighted her track record as California’s attorney general, pointing to legal actions she claims she took against oil companies.

During a CNN town hall on climate change in 2019, asked whether she would sue ExxonMobil, Harris responded, “I have sued ExxonMobil.”
However, this claim was incorrect. While Harris did initiate an investigation into ExxonMobil for allegedly misleading the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change, she never filed a lawsuit against the company.
As her campaign clarified to CNN, Harris’ legal action during her tenure as California attorney general did result in settlements with other oil companies.
For example, she secured a $14 million settlement from BP and Atlantic Richfield Company and an $11.5 million settlement with Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips over violations related to underground fuel tanks. But a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was never filed, and her successor did not pursue one after she left office to join the Senate in 2017.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/politics/harris-oil-companies-emissions-kfile/index.html

CNN
 — 
The November 5 general election approaches, and Americans have some questions.
When CNN asked what was confusing about the system or what to expect in the weeks to come, submissions rolled in.
While many of the questions seemed more like vituperative venting about the presidential candidates, others were constructive and interesting. They ranged from questions about the Electoral College to specific inquiries about why ballots in some counties look the way they do.
I’ve taken the liberty of editing some of these questions for both style and length. I just included first names and state of residence based on the submissions. If we didn’t get to your question in this go-round, stay tuned or ask something new. We’ll add answers to new questions weekly until the election and also send them out to the What Matters newsletter audience. More recent questions are listed first.
Why do you day after day show polls? These do not help anyone. Seems like a waste of time. If you have shown us 100 different polls in the last three months, how does that help a voter? Polls don’t inform us.
Debbie in Florida
Polls are good for some things and not so good for others. They’re bad at showing precisely who will vote and how, but they’re good at showing us what is motivating voters. They can also be useful in showing us the direction a race is heading if there is a definitive trend in one direction.
This particular presidential race is incredibly tight, according to the polls. CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy has a helpful guide on how to use polling information. Read her story: What the polls have told us about the 2024 election.
After the recent offensive comments at the Madison Square Garden rally, I’m wondering if voters are allowed to change their minds if they’ve already voted. Is it possible?
Chad in Virginia
Probably not. The rules are different in each state. When CNN reached out to all 50 states about this very question in 2020, all but five responded, and of those, it was only possible to change an already cast mail-in vote in six states. In battleground Michigan, one of the few states where changing a mail-in vote is possible, the deadline for changing, or “spoiling,” a ballot has already passed.
Why don’t US territories (Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.) get any Electoral College votes? Is there any political will to give them representation for selecting president?
Will in Minnesota
Only the 50 states and Washington, DC, get electoral votes. It took the 23rd Amendment, enacted in 1961, to get electoral votes for Washington, DC. People from US territories are US citizens, and they can vote in the presidential election only if they are living in one of the states or Washington, DC.
Granting statehood to US territories is not a major, current topic of discussion in the US, even though Puerto Rico, with more than 3 million residents, is larger than several US states. Puerto Rican voters did vote in favor of a nonbinding referendum in 2020 and are considering the issue in another referendum on Election Day this year. Becoming a state requires legislation in the US Congress.
Can Trump really dissolve income and Social Security tax?
Dennis
This question is in reference to Donald Trump floating the idea of ending the federal income tax and replacing it with revenue from tariffs, as well as his pledge to stop taxing Social Security benefits if he wins the White House. But presidents don’t have absolute power.
The income tax was established by the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, and Congress has the power to levy taxes. Changing the tax code would require legislation passed through Congress.
Can electors in the Electoral College vote against their state voters’ choice, becoming ‘faithless’ electors? How can that be prevented?
Anonymous
There have been faithless electors in US history. In 2016, for instance, there were seven rogue votes from both red and blue states for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, among others.
In 2020, the US Supreme Court ruled that states can punish faithless electors. Most states have laws that require electors to support the winner in their state, according to the Library of Congress.
How can one tell if the ‘people’s’ votes have been manipulated? … I’m troubled about what a billionaire’s ability to ‘skew the numbers’ mechanically or otherwise can do to our democracy.
-- Jeanette in Virginia
The system has multiple stopgaps and, despite what Trump and Elon Musk say, there are a lot of people on both sides of the political aisle who work very hard to ensure US elections are fair and accurate.
Poll watchers – both Republicans and Democrats – will be present in polling places on Election Day observing what’s going on. Many Americans’ votes are counted by machine, but they fill out a paper ballot, which can be accessed in case of a recount.
Election machines should not be connected to the internet, according to election officials. There are audits of election machines to make sure they work. The courts are available to hear challenges in the event that one side or the other suspects a problem. They can hear evidence and take testimony under oath.
What is the absolute best way to vote to assure that my vote will be counted and not discarded?
-- Elena in Pennsylvania
When you cast a ballot, you’re also expressing your faith in the system that it will be counted. But the process is meant to be transparent and accountable.
You can usually verify that you did vote. When you vote, that’s usually recorded by your city or state, and you can frequently check your state government website to see in which elections you’ve participated.
If you’re voting by mail, you can usually track the progress of your ballot online, like your online food order or your package in the mail.
If you’re voting in person, the vast majority of Americans will use paper ballots, which are processed by voting machines and kept for audits or recounts.
And note: If you’re nervous about the process, it might be a good time to volunteer to work at an election site and see how the process works.
Why does CNN selectively cover negative news about Trump and positive news about Harris?
-- Virginia
There were a lot of questions along these lines. We do cover negative news about Vice President Kamala Harris.
What I’d say is that if you’ve seen the top attack ad against Harris from Trump and his allies over her past support of certain rights for transgender people, it is based on CNN reporting. CNN’s KFile has also uncovered Harris’ earlier positions on oil companies and immigration.
And as Democrats have begun to grow nervous about her campaign, we have covered those developments.
Voters all seem to want Kamala Harris to give specific actions she will take to lower the cost of living. What direct action can a president take to lower prices without the approval of Congress?
-- Gary in Colorado
Presidents get too much credit for good economies and too much blame for bad economies. In this weird election, the economists say the economy is good, but voters say it’s not great.
In a capitalist economy like the US, the president does not directly control prices, although there are levers they can pull. Presidents can impose tariffs without help from Congress. This is Trump’s plan, although experts warn it will raise prices, not lower them.
Harris has promised to go after corporations for price gouging, but it’s not clear if that will lead to the dropping of prices in a broad way – and the plan could backfire, according to some economists. Short answer: It’s hard for presidents to drive down prices.
What are each party’s views on how they would shore up Social Security?
-- Ron
Everyone should be paying attention to Ron’s question. Neither party or candidate is actively talking about this, even though the government has warned that Social Security will not be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035. The political parties will soon have to take this seriously.
Right now, both sides are simply promising to protect Social Security benefits.﻿ It could require raising the retirement age or raising taxes, two things that voters don’t seem to want to hear much about.
Note: The long list of tax breaks Trump has promised, including pledging to stop taxing Social Security benefits, could worsen the program’s finances and lead to cuts to those benefits in six years, according to a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan government watchdog. It did not do a detailed analysis of the impact of Harris’ platform on Social Security, CNN’s Tami Luhby reports, because it said the changes would be minimal.
Why is there no constitutional protection that prevents those who took part in an insurrection from running for office?
-- Chris in South Carolina
There actually is just such a protection in the 14th Amendment, which prohibits anyone who took part in an insurrection from serving in Congress or being an “officer of the United States.” Multiple states pursued removing Trump from their primary ballots based on this clause.
But in March, the US Supreme Court unanimously rejected Colorado’s effort to disqualify Trump from its ballot. A slimmer majority of five conservative justices ruled that for a person to be removed from a ballot for being an insurrectionist, Congress must first pass legislation.
The current Republican majority in the House is not going to pass legislation declaring Trump an insurrectionist. And if he is reelected, Trump has promised to fire the special counsel currently prosecuting him for election interference.
How long after Election Day could we expect to know the final results, given the myriad of lawsuits that will be filed if Donald Trump loses?
-- Steve in California
It could take a while, depending on the number of mail-in ballots cast in some states and how close things are.
CNN did not project that President Joe Biden would win the 2020 election until four days after Election Day. If the election is close in one or more decisive states, it could be longer. In 2000, for instance, the disputed results in Florida carried on for 36 days until the Supreme Court ended a recount.
In 2016, on the other hand, things were relatively close in some key states and Hillary Clinton conceded the day after Election Day. Trump is unlikely to ever concede. Harris has talked about the importance of a peaceful transfer of power.
The 2000 example, in which Republican and ultimate winner George W. Bush was ahead after the initial count, brings up a good point. We can expect that if Trump loses he will contest the results since he has alleged voter fraud in every election in which he was a candidate. However, we should also expect that in the event of a close result in which Harris trails, Democrats will also explore legal avenues.
Rules on how and when a recount is triggered or can be requested vary from state to state. This year, according to a new law, states have until December 11 to ascertain a winner in order to guarantee their electoral votes are counted.
When I asked CNN’s director of election analytics Jennifer Agiesta about all of this, she noted that some states have taken measures since 2020 that will make their counting a bit faster. Her response is below:
Two of the states we projected last in 2020 are good examples: In Georgia, after changes to laws around preelection voting, a lot more people who vote before Election Day do so early in person rather than by mail, which means there are fewer mail ballots to count, which should speed things up.
In North Carolina, they no longer accept by-mail ballots after Election Day, so there is more known about what’s left to count there. And we expect a lot fewer people to vote by mail generally, since we’re not in the middle of a pandemic, so that also ought to speed things up.
The time it takes to process the by-mail ballots is the thing that slows it all down. Pennsylvania, of course, hasn’t made it easier for election officials to get those ballots ready to count before Election Day, so the count will likely keep going there for a while.
Why is it possible for noncitizens to vote in this election? It has never made any sense to me. Between that and no ID needed, it causes animosity and anxiety among the people.
-- Bill in Missouri
It is not possible for noncitizens to vote in this election. Congress outlawed noncitizen voting in 1996.
If a noncitizen voted, the person would be breaking the law and probably would be deported. While Trump has alleged for years that there is an epidemic of noncitizen voting, there is zero evidence to back that up.
Every state except North Dakota requires voter registration. Each vote is paired with a registration. States routinely scrub their voter rolls. There are some few instances of people who are noncitizens becoming registered to vote, but it’s usually an error. When states identify noncitizens accidentally on their rolls, they are removed.
The conservative Heritage Foundation tracks prosecutions for noncitizen voting. There have been 25 in the past 20 years. Critics argue that Trump’s insistence there is noncitizen voting is a scare tactic.
While there are very few cities in California, Maryland and Vermont and in Washington, DC, that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, those are the exceptions to the rule. No noncitizen can vote for president.

Why in Ohio on the ballot do you have to scroll to the next page in order to vote for Harris? All the other candidates are on the first page of the electronic ballot. If a poll worker doesn’t tell you to scroll, you will not see Harris’ name.
-- Sheila in Ohio
In order to answer Sheila’s question, I called Nicole Unzicker, director of the Board of Elections in Butler County, where Sheila lives.
It turns out that a paper version of the ballot used for mail-in voting shows all of the candidates in one line. However, for in-person voting on the Dominion system used there, the text for the first ballot question is large and long. That means in-person voters must scroll to see all of the presidential candidates when they get to the president question.
Unzicker said the order of candidates is always alphabetical, but the first listed candidate is rotated between the county’s roughly 300 precincts. So both Harris and Trump should be on the bottom half of the scroll for an equal number of voters.
With long and large wording for ballot initiatives, the scroll is a known issue, according to Unzicker. She said her office created a video that plays for voters in line and also has instructions at each voting station.
It’s important to remember that ballots are different within states and even counties depending on which offices are up for election. For information on your state, check out CNN’s Voter Handbook.
How can we eliminate the Electoral College?
-- Linda in Washington
There were a lot of questions about the Electoral College, which should frustrate people on both sides of the aisle. There will be more Trump voters in California than in Texas and more Harris voters in Texas than in New York.
You’d need to change the US Constitution to eliminate the Electoral College. And that’s not impossible. The 12th Amendment changed the process early in US history.
But enacting a constitutional amendment is a long, arduous, two-step process.
First, an amendment can be proposed by a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate, or two-thirds of states can propose an amendment by requesting a constitutional convention.
Second, once an amendment is proposed, it must be ratified by either three-quarters of the state legislatures or conventions called in each state.
It’s a difficult enough process that the most recent amendment, the 27th, was ratified 32 years ago. It focused on congressional compensation. The 26th Amendment, which made 18 the official voting age, was ratified more than a half-century ago, in 1971.
There have been multiple attempts to eliminate the Electoral College in US history, most recently in 1969, when a bill passed the US House with overwhelming support but was filibustered in the Senate.
States have also changed the system by moving to pick their electors as proxies for the popular vote in states rather than as a group of electors who can vote however they wish.
There is an effort to simply ignore the Electoral College and honor the popular vote winner. Multiple states have agreed to a National Popular Vote compact, whereby they would award their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner. The agreement only kicks in when states representing a majority of electoral votes sign on. They’re still about 61 electoral votes short.
Will we ever move past the Electoral College? The Electoral College makes my vote for POTUS irrelevant. I’m from a traditionally blue state. Regardless of how I vote, I’m blue. If I don’t vote, I’m blue. I understand the past points which bred the Electoral College, but I’d argue irrelevancy or disempowerment today to Democrats, or to 43 out of 50 states. Will we ever be able to remedy this constitutional disenfranchisement?
-- Terry
I’m certainly not going to be the person who defends the Electoral College here. But I will point out your vote only seems irrelevant because there is a strong majority in your state. States change.
Remember when Florida was THE swing state? It wasn’t that long ago.
Remember when Ohio was a major swing state? Both are now essentially red.
Democrats have been salivating over Texas and North Carolina for years, trying to turn them blue. While two of the past six elections ended with a Republican getting fewer votes but winning the White House, there is some serious conjecture that this year could see Trump win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College.
That would be a plot twist to drive his conspiracy theories.
None of this is to endorse the Electoral College or justify using something from the era of slavery in today’s America. But it is also true that politics is always changing.
There is a lot of talk about Trump’s following being uneducated. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF AMERICAN VOTERS are UNEDUCATED STARTING WITH (WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF UNEDUCATED)?
-- Harvey
Let’s not use the term “uneducated,” which is pejorative. Harvey’s use of all caps is evidence that term is loaded.
There is a definite divide in this country between voters on the basis of what level of education they attained. Those with college degrees may be more likely to support Harris. Those without college degrees may be more likely to support Trump.
I wrote recently about the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik’s argument that education level is the best predictor of how a person will vote. We will have to see if that plays out on Election Day.
A recent report by the Lumina Foundation found that about 14% of Americans have a graduate or professional degree and about 23% stopped after earning a bachelor’s degree. About 9% have an associate degree, and about 8% have a post-high school certification of some kind.
Congress should also set term limits for members of Congress and the Supreme Court. The current system allows for people to stay in power and control who have outdated opinions and an inability to be objective and work with members who have new perspectives.
-- Patricia
This is more of a comment than a question, but it’s worth exploring. Presidents are limited to two terms, so why not members of Congress? Because of the Supreme Court.
The court ruled in 1995 that imposing term limits on members of Congress would require a constitutional amendment. The decision barred states from imposing their own term limits on their members of Congress.
There is talk of lawmakers passing a law to reform the Supreme Court and impose term limits on justices, but that is in its early stages and currently lacks overwhelming support.
When Congress tried with a Republican majority in the mid-’90s to propose a term limits amendment for members of Congress, it failed repeatedly.
What was the closest result of all elections in the US?
Unsigned
There are a few ways to look at this, either in the popular vote or the Electoral College.
In the Electoral College, the closest election was relatively recent, in 2000. Bush got 271 electoral votes, one more than he needed to win the White House. Al Gore got a little more than 500,000 more total votes. The tightest possible margin in Florida, 537 votes, essentially decided the election. But there was also a narrow Bush win in New Hampshire too. Every state counts!
The election of 1876 between eventual-winner Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden was decided by a single electoral vote, but only after the electoral votes of three states were disputed. A special commission ultimately awarded them to Hayes even though Tilden got more popular votes.
There are closer popular vote margins. These include 1960, when John F. Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by about 119,000 ballots in the popular vote, and 1880, when James Garfield defeated Gen. Winfield Hancock despite getting fewer than 2,000 more popular votes. But neither of those was close in the Electoral College.
I’m not including the election of 1800, even though it resulted in a tie in the Electoral College. For starters, many state legislatures picked electors in early American elections, so it’s hard to say who got more popular votes. Second, the tie was between two running mates. They simply did not coordinate in the Electoral College.
What have the Republicans put into place to take a Trump loss to the courts? The same cheating chants they rolled out four years ago? This time, they do not have the power of the presidency from which to negate the voters’ choices.
-- Sandra
Not only do Republicans not currently hold the presidency, but Congress actually passed a law in 2022 making clear that the vice president’s role in counting electoral votes is only ceremonial. They also changed the bar by which lawmakers can challenge a state’s electoral votes.
That said, CNN has reported that much of what special counsel Jack Smith accused Trump and his campaign of engineering after his 2020 loss is still in play for 2024. These include unfounded allegations of large numbers of undocumented immigrants casting ballots, something for which there is no evidence. They are also filing many preelection lawsuits, setting the groundwork to file lawsuits challenging the results if they don’t go Trump’s way. Read more about GOP challenges to mail-in voting.
Why aren’t the Democrats touting how well the economy is doing now – jobs , inflation coming down, interest rates coming down, unemployment down – prices are still a bit high but the government doesn’t control all of that – it’s a good recovery story since the pandemic mess that Trump left – right?
-- Julie from Michigan
Trump supporters have a different view, but this is a good question about strategy. While the general mood about the economy has improved, it’s still quite dim. More than half the country, 52%, said in a recent Gallup poll that they feel worse off than they did four years ago.
It might be bad politics for a candidate to tell people who are having trouble affording things that they’re wrong about the way they feel. If you listen to Harris, she does say a lot of the things you suggest above, that inflation is coming down, but she also clearly wants to appeal to the Americans who are having trouble affording groceries, who can’t afford to buy a house and who feel like there’s a lot more work to be done.

 — 
There’s a reason Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are intensifying efforts to reach beyond their party’s traditional supporters in the final weeks of this razor-thin campaign.
Extending a pattern that stretches back decades, White voters without a college degree, the cornerstone of the modern GOP coalition, have declined by a little more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters since 2020, falling below 40% of the eligible voting pool for the first time ever, according a new analysis of the latest Census Bureau data by demographer William Frey shared exclusively with CNN.
While those working-class Whites are shrinking, Frey found that both Whites with at least a four-year college degree and voters of color have each increased since 2020 by about a single percentage point as a share of eligible voters. Those increases also continue long-term trends that have seen well-educated Whites grow to represent more than 1-in-4 eligible voters and people of color rise past 1-in-3.
These trends help explain why the former president has devoted so much effort to reaching beyond his traditional base of White voters without a college education to attract more Black and Latino voters, especially men. And, in turn, the trends help explain the emphasis the vice president is placing on attracting more college-educated White voters who have previously leaned toward the GOP — a priority she underscored by barnstorming across populous white-collar suburbs outside Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney on Monday.
The impact of these incremental shifts in the composition of the major voter groups can easily be outweighed by changes in the preferences of those groups. Trump, for instance, is counting on gains among Latino voters, especially men, to neutralize the anticipated benefits for Democrats as Latinos increase their share of the vote, particularly in closely contested Arizona and Nevada.
But the cumulative impact of these shifts in the electorate’s basic composition is undeniable. Trump, for instance, in each of his two presidential campaigns won nearly as big a share of White voters without a college education as Ronald Reagan did in 1984, according to exit polls. Yet because those working-class Whites had fallen from about two-thirds of voters in 1984 to around two-fifths now, Trump only won about 47% of the total vote in each of his two campaigns, while Reagan captured nearly 59%.
Even this year, in a race so close, small shifts in the electorate’s composition across the most competitive states could make a difference. For instance, the fact that non-college Whites, according to Frey’s analysis, have fallen as a share of the eligible electorate since 2020 considerably more in Michigan and Wisconsin than in Pennsylvania may help explain why most analysts consider the Keystone State more difficult than the other two for Harris.
Shifts in racial and educational levels are not the only important changes Frey, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank, has tracked in the make-up of eligible voters between 2020 and 2024. He also found that women will comprise nearly 52% of all eligible voters, which should help Harris. But his analysis shows that number actually represents a very small shift in the eligible electorate since 2020 toward men, which at the margin might benefit Trump. Frey also finds that Generation Z will make a big jump in their share of eligible voters, from about 1-in-10 last time to more than 1-in-6 this year. That increase underscores the stakes in Harris’ attempt to max out her support among younger women and Trump’s determined attempts to court young men.
Frey’s analysis finds that the White voters without a college degree are declining as a share of eligible voters not only in the nation overall but specifically across almost all of the seven battleground states. (North Carolina is the sole swing state where he found that they had increased as a portion of eligible voters since 2020.)
That decline is rooted in an ongoing process of generational replacement. Compared to younger generations, America’s older cohorts are much more heavily White and also much less likely to hold at least a four-year college degree. As those older Whites age out of the electorate, and more diverse and better-educated generations grow into it, the composition of the eligible voter pool inexorably transforms.
“Whites are a shrinking part of the population and a part of that population which is shrinking even more are the people who don’t have college education,” said Frey.
While these blue-collar Whites are receding in both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt electorates, different kinds of voters are replacing them across the two regions, Frey found.
These blue-collar Whites represent a much larger share of the total electorate in the Rustbelt than the Sunbelt: Frey found that in 2020 they comprised around half of eligible voters in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and nearly three-fifths in Wisconsin.
But Frey found that since 2020, they have declined more rapidly than almost anywhere else in Michigan (falling by nearly 3 percentage points) and Wisconsin (dropping by more than 3 percentage points). In Michigan, he found a slight increase in minority voters among the eligible voter pool, while in Wisconsin those non-White voters, who were already a smaller share of eligibles than in the other Rustbelt battlegrounds, actually declined even further.
In both states, the big gainers since 2020 are Whites with at least a four-year college degree: Frey found they increased more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters in Michigan and over 4 points in Wisconsin.
In Pennsylvania, the shift isn’t as dramatic: Frey found that the non-college White share of eligible voters dropped since 2020 by about 1.5 percentage points, about half as much as in the other two former “blue wall” states. A small increase in the minority population made up most of that difference, with college-educated Whites increasing only very slightly.
Across the Sunbelt battlegrounds, blue-collar Whites are a smaller share of the eligible voters: about 1-in-3 in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and just over 2-in-5 in North Carolina. Arizona and Georgia saw big increases since 2020 in the minority share of their eligible voter population, Frey found, while non-Whites actually declined somewhat in North Carolina and remained almost unchanged in Nevada. College-educated Whites increased as a portion of eligible voters in Nevada and Arizona, while falling slightly in Georgia and essentially holding steady in North Carolina.
After these shifts, the minority share of the eligible voting population will remain much higher in the Sunbelt than Rustbelt states, with voters of color representing about one-third of the eligible voter population in North Carolina, a little more than two-fifths in Arizona and more than 45% in both Nevada and Georgia.
In both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt, the winning modern demographic formula for Democrats since the 1990s has been to maximize their support among non-White voters and grow their support among college-educated Whites, while holding down their losses among the blue-collar Whites, with a particular focus on women in each group. In the Trump era, the dominant GOP demographic strategy has been to maximize their support among working-class voters without a college degree, particularly men. That strategy has broadened from a nearly exclusive focus on White working-class voters in Trump’s 2016 race to his more panoramic attempt this year to attract non-college-educated Black and Latino voters as well, especially men.
Manuel Pastor, director of the Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California, says the contrasting strategies of Harris and Trump in the campaign’s final days illuminate “the task of reinvention that each party faces” as a result of the electorate’s ongoing racial and educational reconfiguration.
Trump, Pastor notes, has responded to the relentless increase in the electorate’s diversity by stressing “really a more male-leaning, masculine approach that is helping to make inroads with Latino males and, to a lesser extent, Black males.” (Trump is devoting a comparable effort to courting younger White men, especially those without college degrees, appearing on podcasts and other media sources where they congregate.)
And while Harris is expending enormous defensive effort on holding as many Latino and especially Black men as possible, she’s also accepting the shifting composition of the party’s coalition more explicitly than President Joe Biden did in 2020 and throughout his presidency, Pastor believes.
Biden, he notes, embodied an almost nostalgic desire to hold onto the Democrats’ mid-20th century base of White working-class voters, but Harris, the daughter of two academics herself, has leaned more comfortably into the party’s modern identity as a coalition primarily of often economically struggling minorities and more comfortable college-educated suburbanites.
“Where Democrats have made inroads is with college-educated Whites who are offended by Trump’s language around immigrants, around his dalliance with right-wing neo-fascist groups and language, with the threats around ‘the enemy within’ — all of the stuff Harris is trying to make sure to get into the conversation” in these final days, Pastor said.
Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster who specializes in demographic trends, said the offsetting gains of Democrats with well-educated Whites and Trump with blue-collar non-Whites should be understand as inextricably linked components of the same dynamic. “Trump doing better among working class minorities is a function of Democrats doing better among college educated voters,” Ruffini, the author of the recent book “Party of the People” about the shifting GOP coalition, wrote in an email. “As the electorate polarizes on education, the nonwhite working class will not be immune from these trends and will gravitate towards Trump more than your standard issue Republican. I think he is broadening the coalition, not necessarily with a lot of intentional effort, but because of natural dynamics in the electorate,” he added.
Democrats need to remain at least competitive among working-class White voters, particularly in the Rustbelt battlegrounds, where historically they have been able to win a significantly higher percentage of them than in the South (where far more of those voters are staunchly conservative evangelical Christians). But anywhere in the country, the most realistic goal for Democrats among these working-class Whites — especially against Trump’s formidable appeal to them — is to hold down their losses.
The groups that Harris needs to give her winning margins are the non-White and college-educated White voters (especially women in each case). The fact that both of those groups are increasing in the electorate, while Trump’s best cohort is shrinking, may give Harris a small swell in her sails. “The growing parts of the population are leaning Democrat, even in this time” when so many voters are discontented with conditions in the country, Frey said. The fact that women are likely to cast more ballots than men in all the swing states, he believes, will provide a small lift to Harris as well.
But many analysts point out these demographic changes can easily be overcome if Trump can reduce the Democratic margins among the groups she’s likely to win, or expand his own lead among his best groups. For instance, the fact that members of Gen Z are growing in the electorate should benefit Harris, given that Democrats have won big majorities among young people in every election since 2004, the first when millennials entered the electorate in large numbers. But while Harris is posting huge advantages among Gen Z women, Trump may somewhat blunt the impact of this generational transition if he can run as well among Gen Z men as polls show is now possible.
Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the recent book “The Politics of Gen Z,” says almost everything about Trump’s messaging on cultural, racial and gender issues profoundly alienates the vast majority of Gen Z women. “I think Gen Z women, including White women, are very committed to an inclusive democracy,” she said.
But while young men may not entirely endorse Trump’s most vituperative and vitriolic messages about racial and cultural change either, she said, they are less likely to find such statements disqualifying amid their concerns about their economic prospects. (Among younger generations, far more women than men are earning four-year and post-graduate college degrees.) Some younger men may also find Trump’s swaggering persona attractive, she noted, viewing him almost as an “anti-hero.”
“For young people in general, there are huge amounts of economic anxiety,” Deckman said. “But I think the difference is that Gen Z women are more likely to prioritize social issues whereas Gen Z men tend to vote more on pocketbook issues.”
These cross-currents among the electorate’s youngest cohort underscores a larger point: At such a fluid moment in US politics, the shift in the electorate’s composition doesn’t so much portend the result of this year’s election as define the assignments that each side faces in attempting to assemble a winning coalition.
One other factor is critical to any discussion of how demographic change may influence the balance of power between the two parties this year. The composition of the actual voters who turn up on Election Day is shaped not only by the share of eligible voters each group represents, but also, of course, by their turnout rates.
College-educated White voters consistently turn out at much higher rates than any other group. In the 2020 election, nearly 9-in-10 eligible White adults with at least a four-year college degree voted, compared to just under 2-in-3 Whites without a college degree and about 3-in-5 non-White voters, according to calculations from Census data provided to me by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who studies voter participation.
As a result, the college-educated Whites tend to comprise a slightly larger share of the actual than eligible electorate while the relationship is reversed for the other two groups. Analyzing Census data, Frey and McDonald both found that in 2020 college-educated Whites cast just over 3-in-10 votes, while people of color cast just below 3-in-10. The White voters without a college degree remained the electorate’s largest group, but they cast slightly less than 40% of all votes — the first time they had fallen below that threshold among actual voters. (Census data indicates that these blue-collar Whites fell below a majority of the nation’s electorate for the first time in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first Black president.)
A similar pattern is evident along gender lines. Eligible female voters have turned out at a higher rate than eligible male voters in every election since 1980, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. (Before that, men voted at higher rates than women.) That gap can be substantial: using Census data, Frey has calculated that in the presidential elections since 2004, turnout among eligible women has always exceeded the rate among men by at least 3.3 percentage points, reaching as much as 4 points in some cases.
As a result, according to Frey’s analysis of Census data, in all of the seven swing states, women in 2020 comprised a larger share of actual than eligible voters. They represented about 52% of actual voters last time in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, 54% in North Carolina and around 55% in both Arizona and Georgia, he found. (Nationwide, Frey’s analysis of Census data showed women casting 53% of all ballots, slightly more than their 52% share of the eligible electorate.) One rule of thumb among Democrats is that they usually triumph when they win women by at least as large a margin as Republicans win men; these data indicate Harris could survive even if Trump wins men by slightly more.
Young people, of course, consistently turn out at much lower rates than older voters, even though their participation has trended upward in the Trump era. Potentially worrisome for Trump is that the gender gap in turnout rates is even greater for young women and men than it is among the older generations, the Rutgers Center has found. Younger non-White men, who have expressed the most receptivity to Trump in minority communities, have an especially meager turnout record.
Other sources of data about the composition of the electorate in 2020 paint slightly different pictures than the Census data Frey uses. The Pew Research Center’s validated voters study put Whites without a college degree at 42% of all voters, while the analysis by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, figured them at 44%. Each of those analyses placed both the college-educated Whites and non-Whites just a tick lower than the Census data. Pew, the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN, and the AP/VoteCast project with NORC found that women represented just a slightly smaller share of all voters last time than the Census did; Catalist concluded they represented even more.
Still, all these data sources agree on the same basic pattern over the differing periods that they cover. Consistently they find Whites without a college degree shrinking as a share of actual voters at a rate of about 2 percentage points every four years, with non-Whites posting the greatest gains and college-educated Whites increasing more slowly, though also steadily growing. And they agree that women now consistently cast the majority of votes in presidential elections.
No one, of course, can entirely predict how many voters from each of these groups will turn out this year. But this history clearly shows it is likely that the changes in the composition of the eligible electorate Frey has documented will closely track the shifts in the configuration of the actual electorate. Most of the experts I spoke with believe it’s a good bet that, just as with the eligible population, Whites without a college degree will continue to shrink as a share of actual voters by about 2 percentage points, while people of color and college-educated Whites will each slightly rise.
These glacial shifts in the nature of the American electorate typically leave their mark over decades, rather than from election to election. But this may be a butterfly effect election where even the smallest flutter in the environment could tip the balance between two political coalitions that are utterly antithetical in their vision for America’s future, but also almost exactly equal in size.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/changing-electorate-trump-harris-analysis/index.html
117,General Politics,2024,11,"Who is Usha Vance, the next second lady of the United States?",Arit John,"CNN
 — 
JD Vance has had several introductions to the American people: as the author of a memoir on what ails the White working class, a newly elected Republican senator in his home state of Ohio, a controversial running mate pick and the next vice president of the United States.
His wife, Usha, has been a key part of each iteration.
More than most political spouses, she has avoided the spotlight and favored a more private, background role on the Trump campaign. But the Yale-educated lawyer was beside her husband at Donald Trump’s election night watch party in West Palm Beach as voters made him the 47th president – and her, in turn, the first Asian American second lady. She is also the first second lady with a Hindu background.
JD Vance thanked her for “making it possible to do this” in a post on X after the Republican ticket’s win.
The future second lady has avoided talking about how she would approach the role. Asked what subject areas she’d focus on, she told NBC News last month that she would “see what happens on November 5, and collect some information myself and take it from there.”

Trump critic-turned-ally JD Vance elected vice president, offering glimpse at GOP’s potential future
“This is such an intense and busy experience that I have not given a ton of thought to my own roles and responsibilities,” she said. “It’s not something I’m terribly familiar with.”
The Vances, who are nearly half the former president’s age and has three young children (ages 7, 4 and 2), infused the GOP ticket with a burst of youthfulness during a cycle that had long been defined by the advanced ages of the two major-party nominees. (Democratic President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid less than a week after Vance became Trump’s running mate.)
But the Ohio senator, who has only been in office since January 2023, faced questions over both his lack of political experience and his transition from 2016 Trump critic to heir to the MAGA movement. Usha Vance played an understated but key role in helping introduce him to the public.
“Sometimes people say that he’s changed a lot, but the truth is I’ve known him now for so many years, and he’s always been so true to himself,” she told Newsmax during a 2022 interview with her husband.
While she wasn’t a vocal surrogate in her husband’s path to becoming the nation’s 50th vice president, Usha Vance made campaign appearances alongside her husband across the country, ranging from visiting a Baptist church in Damascus, Virginia, to a sports bar in Greenville, North Carolina. JD Vance said in September that his wife was doing a “little bit of homeschooling” while their kids were on the campaign trail.
In her first solo interview on Fox News in August, Usha Vance defended controversial remarks her husband made prior to joining the GOP ticket, including his deriding of childless adults. She also downplayed his labeling of some Democratic politicians as “childless cat ladies,” calling it a “quip.”
“JD, absolutely at the time and today, would never, ever, ever want to say something to hurt someone who was trying to have a family, who really was struggling with that,” she said at the time. “I also understand there are a lot of other reasons why people may choose not to have families, and many of those reasons are very good.”
For years, the senator has described his wife as a key part of his success, dating back to when the two attended law school together at Yale University, where Usha Vance also graduated summa cum laude with a bachelor’s degree.
In his 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” JD Vance described her as his “Yale spirit guide,” helping him navigate life at the elite university where they met.
“She instinctively understood the questions I didn’t even know to ask, and she always encouraged me to seek opportunities that I didn’t know existed,” he wrote.
The two were married in an interfaith ceremony in Kentucky in 2014 – Usha Vance’s family is Hindu, while her husband converted to Catholicism in 2019.

Vance insists Trump’s ‘enemy from within’ comments weren’t directed at political rivals
The daughter of Indian immigrants, Usha Chilukuri grew up in a suburb of San Diego. After college – two stints at Yale and a masters of philosophy at the University of Cambridge – she clerked for two Supreme Court justices – Brett Kavanaugh when he served on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Chief Justice John Roberts.
In 2015, she started as an associate at Munger, Tolles & Olson, a law firm with offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Washington, DC. She continued working at the firm between clerkships, where – according to an archived version of her employee biography – she handled “complex civil litigation and appeals” in sectors that included “higher education, local government, entertainment, and technology, including semiconductors.”
The firm announced that she had resigned shortly after Trump selected Vance as his running mate.
“Usha has informed us she has decided to leave the firm,” the company said in a statement. “Usha has been an excellent lawyer and colleague, and we thank her for her years of work and wish her the best in her future career.”
In July, as the Ohio delegation chanted her husband’s name on the Republican convention floor in Milwaukee , Usha Vance stood beside the first-term senator and applauded as he was nominated by voice vote to be Trump’s running mate.
Weeks earlier, the trial lawyer and former judicial clerk had admitted she wasn’t “raring” to completely upend the life she and her husband had built together or to face the attention that would follow.
“I don’t know that anyone is ever ready for that kind of scrutiny,” she told Fox News in June during a joint interview with the senator at their home in Ohio. “I think we found the first campaign that he embarked on to be a shock. It was so different from anything we’d ever done before. But it was an adventure.”
She added that she was open to seeing how things unfolded.

118,General Politics,2024,11,"Trump allies, private sector quietly prepare for mass detention of immigrants",Priscilla Alvarez,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump’s allies and some in the private sector have been quietly preparing to detain and deport migrants residing in the United States on a large scale, according to four sources familiar with the discussions.
And with the former president becoming the president-elect, those preparations are now expected to ramp up.
Immigration was a cornerstone of Trump’s 2024 campaign, and while he repeatedly touted promises of mass deportation on the trail – putting increased emphasis on interior enforcement compared to his 2016 fixation on the border wall – members of his orbit and some in the private sector discussed what that plan would look like, according to the sources.
Trump’s day one priority is to reinstate his former administration’s border policies and reverse those of President Joe Biden, senior Trump adviser Jason Miller told CNN.
Early discussions among Trump’s team have focused on removing undocumented immigrants who have committed crimes, a source familiar with the team’s preliminary plans told CNN. A key issue under consideration is how, when and if to deport immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, commonly known as Dreamers.

Trump’s second term will look nothing like his first
Targeting Dreamers would be a departure from the historically bipartisan support they’ve enjoyed. Some are temporarily protected by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that allows recipients to live and work in the US.
Tom Homan, who previously served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, could potentially serve as one of the leads on immigration in the administration, sources said.
“It’s not gonna be – a mass sweep of neighborhoods. It’s not gonna be building concentration camps. I’ve read it all. It’s ridiculous,” Homan told CBS News in an interview that aired last month.
“They’ll be targeted arrests. We’ll know who we’re going to arrest, where we’re most likely to find ‘em based on numerous, you know, investigative processes,” he added.
Brian Hughes, a Trump senior adviser, said that when the president-elect returns to the White House, one of his priorities will be border security.
“President Trump won a landslide victory Tuesday because Americans embrace his common sense policy to secure our border and implement mass deportation for illegal migrants,” Hughes said.
Logistical challenges
Even before Tuesday night, some in the private sector who help provide services for detention spaces had already been in ongoing discussions about a potential second Trump term and are expecting planning to pick up, according to one of the sources.
One of the key elements of any plan to deport immigrants is detention space, which Democratic and Republican administrations have grappled with because of limited resources.
The federal government contracts with the private sector to build, operate and manage detention facilities, and works with county jails.
“There’s a small number of beds that are federally owned facilities. The rest of them are split between private detention facilities and county jails,” said John Sandweg, who served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Obama administration. “There’s an ICE presence, but by and large the people operating the detention centers are employees of the contractors.”
There are a number of contractors the incoming Trump administration can lean on, including those who already have existing agreements with the federal government, making it a potentially easier process.
The hard part, current and former ICE officials said, is finding the money.
The average cost of apprehending, detaining, processing and removing one undocumented immigrant from the United States in 2016 was $10,900, according to figures released by ICE at the time. That year, ICE also said the average cost of transporting one deportee to their home country was $1,978. Since then, the costs have only grown.
ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations has generally been underfunded and has previously had to reprogram funds to expand detention space, especially during border surges. But there are limits to how much money can be reprogrammed, officials said.
“They would need to be aggressive to make sure they don’t have to reprogram,” one former senior ICE official said, citing the upcoming budget cycle. “If they want to accomplish the goals they’ve been talking about, they’d need orders of magnitude change.”
That also includes bolstering personnel, which has previously been a challenge for the agency.
“As far as the detention, they can canvas the existing contractors out there. They can move relatively quickly,” the former senior ICE official said, adding that deportations can be challenging with certain countries.
“Every country has different requirements for travel documents. Mexico and Central America, removals can happen quickly from the time they have order of removal. Most any other country it takes a lot longer,” they added.
ICE also has limitations in holding immigrant families – and is not responsible for holding unaccompanied migrant children; that responsibility lies within the Health and Human Services Department.
Mixed outlook at DHS
At the Department of Homeland Security, which is charged with immigration enforcement, officials are bracing for a seismic shift in immigration policy under the incoming Trump administration, prompting some interagency calls Wednesday as people prepare for the weeks ahead.
One Homeland Security official described the mood internally as a “mixed bag.” One of the questions top of mind among those in the department Wednesday was what will happen to Biden administration policies, like parole programs for certain nationalities that allowed beneficiaries to temporarily work and live in the United States.
“Shell shocked among the political,” another Homeland Security official said.
In his first days in office, Biden did away with many of the Trump administration’s controversial immigration policies. Now those policies may make a return.
For some at DHS, that comes as welcome news. Over the last three years, the Biden administration grappled with multiple border crises, garnering fierce criticism internally and externally among Republicans and Democrats.
Biden administration officials ultimately landed on a much harsher stance on the US-Mexico border that resulted in a dramatic drop in migrant crossings over recent months.
Still, some in the department’s immigration enforcement agencies welcomed Trump’s win.
“There is a lot of optimism and hope,” another Homeland Security official said.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/politics/trump-immigrant-detention-plans/index.html
119,General Politics,2024,11,Trump’s mass deportation plans would be costly. Here’s why,Catherine E. Shoichet,"CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump has vowed he’ll kick millions of undocumented immigrants out of the US when he returns to power.
In the months since cheering supporters waved “mass deportation now” signs at the Republican National Convention, Trump and his surrogates have offered various visions for how they’ll achieve this goal. But they’ve left no doubt that it’s a top priority.
“As soon as I take the oath of office,” Trump said in July, “we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.”
“If you’re in the country illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder,” former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chief Tom Homan said as he warned that no one would be off the table.
Trump adviser Stephen Miller said the military would be involved.
And vice president-elect JD Vance said deporting criminals would be the administration’s initial focus.
Experts say any path the future Trump administration chooses will be complicated and costly, due to both the billions of dollars needed to fund mass deportation and the significant ripple effects that will hit the economy.
Here’s a look at some key facts and figures that explain why.
1.5 million
The number of deportations during Trump’s presidency, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis of government statistics.
On the campaign trail and during his presidency, Trump vowed that deporting undocumented immigrants would be a priority, and claimed as many as 3 million criminals would be deported when he was in office. But ultimately, he deported far fewer people than he’d promised.
In one particularly high-profile instance, Trump announced a massive operation to deport millions of people would be happening imminently in the summer of 2019. While some arrests occurred, the large-scale raids never materialized.
The Biden administration is on pace to match the Trump administration’s deportation numbers, according to the Migration Policy Institute’s analysis.
“Look at the history of ICE and the Trump years, where there was no lack of political will to deport people,” says John Sandweg, an acting director of the agency during the Obama administration. “And the maximum amount they could do (in one year) was 267,000.”
Trump advisers and outside allies told CNN earlier this year that this time, they’ve mapped out a concrete pathway to rapidly implement his immigration policy plans — and lessons learned during his previous term in office have helped them do that.
Why wasn’t Trump able to deport more people when he was in office?
Experts noted then, as they note today, that high costs and complex logistics make mass deportation more complicated than campaign promises suggest.
“It’s nearly impossible to implement,” says Laura Collins, an immigration policy expert at the George W. Bush Presidential Center.
Sandweg says even deporting 1 million people in a year, something vice presidential candidate JD Vance has suggested would be the administration’s starting point, simply isn’t realistic.
“It’s selling a fantasy to people,” he says.
$10,900
The average cost of apprehending, detaining, processing and removing one undocumented immigrant from the United States in 2016, according to figures released by ICE at the time.
That year ICE also said the average cost of transporting one deportee to their home country was $1,978.
Since then, the costs have only grown, Sandweg says, because the migrants coming to the US are from a wider range of countries.
“Now we’re facing a larger migration from all over the world,” he says.
That means deportation flights are more expensive, and the logistics around them are more complicated.

So what would deporting the millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States cost?
In 2015, an analysis Collins co-authored for the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank, estimated arresting and removing all undocumented immigrants from the US would cost at least $100 billion and take 20 years. Recent estimates from immigrant advocates calculated an even higher cost. If 1 million undocumented immigrants are deported per year, mass deportation could cost more than $960 billion over more than a decade, according to the American Immigration Council.
Both of those reports were based on estimates that the undocumented immigrant population is around 11 million people, and the assumption that about 20% of the population could choose to leave the US voluntarily. A Pew Research Center report in July noted the undocumented population has likely grown over the past two years.
$992 million
The amount the Department of Homeland Security budgeted for “soft-sided” temporary detention facilities along the border in fiscal year 2023.
Trump adviser Stephen Miller has said a mass deportation operation would require officials to build massive facilities for immigrant detentions that could hold some 70,000 people — more than 10 times the capacity of the seven soft-sided facilities in the 2023 budget. Miller has described the plan to build new detention space as “greater than any national infrastructure project we’ve done to date.”
Tom Homan, who led ICE during Trump’s first administration, has pushed back on such characterizations.
“It’s not going to be a mass sweep of neighborhoods. It’s not going to be building concentration camps. I’ve read it all. It’s ridiculous,” Homan told “60 Minutes” when asked to describe his vision last month. Instead, Homan said, operations would be more targeted in nature.
But experts say any increase in arrests will inevitably correlate with an increase in detention.
Operating a soft-sided shelter can cost up to $40 million a month, according to Jason Houser, a former ICE chief of staff.
“It’s not just about throwing up a tent,” he says. “I have to staff it, I have to put security there, I have to put doctors there, I have to have some sanitation there, I have to put medics there, I have to put childcare there.”
Using more space in state and local jail facilities rather than building new facilities would also come with a hefty price tag, Houser says.
“That’s going to be $300 or $350 a night,” he says.
And if deportations were increased to the level Trump has proposed, detention space isn’t the only thing that would need to grow, Sandweg says. The ICE workforce would need to dramatically increase in size.
“You are talking about an increase of five or six times in the size of ICE operations. … hiring thousands of new officers, building tens of thousands of new detention beds,” he says.
That would require Congress to authorize billions of dollars in additional spending — something Sandweg describes as “incredibly hard.”
And even if that happens, he says, the logistical steps and time needed to hire people and build facilities could easily stretch for an entire presidential term.
1,016 days
The average time it takes for a case to make its way through immigration court, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
This can vary considerably depending on the court location and other factors. On a national level, the already-huge backlog of cases in immigration court has increased significantly during the Biden administration, more than doubling from nearly 1.3 million cases in January 2021 to more than 3.7 million cases today.
The overwhelmed immigration courts would likely slow down any effort to deport more people.
“There are still legal processes that we have to go through in order to remove somebody,” Collins says. “They have the right to mount a defense. … Just because you’re not a citizen doesn’t mean you don’t have legal rights in this country.”
After ICE arrests someone, lengthy delays in immigration court proceedings mean years can pass before a case is completed.
“It doesn’t matter how many people you arrest,” Sandweg says, “because the Constitution requires that they get due process, which means they have an opportunity to pitch their case to an immigration court.”
13
The number of countries deemed “recalcitrant” by the Department of Homeland Security as of 2020. That term applies to countries that generally won’t accept deportation flights or help provide travel documents to their citizens when the US wants to remove them.
The list at the time included China, Cuba, India, and Russia, according to the Migration Policy Institute.
Exactly which countries are on the list can fluctuate amid geopolitical turmoil and diplomatic pressure. During the first Trump administration, officials used visa sanctions to pressure some uncooperative countries to comply. During the Biden administration, officials negotiated with Mexican authorities to send some deportees from uncooperative countries there.
But agreements over deportation can be fragile. Venezuela, for example, had agreed to accept deportees, but the deal fell apart earlier this year, according to MPI.
It’s a significant issue that a new Trump administration would have to contend with for any major deportation operation, Houser says, particularly given that large numbers of migrants from those countries have come to the US in recent years.
“If they’re Cuban, they’re not going home. If they’re Venezuelan, they’re not going home,” Houser says.
Officials could negotiate deals for a third country to accept deportees, he said. But in the short term, it’s likely a second Trump administration would focus on nationalities that can be deported more quickly, Houser says. If higher numbers remain a priority, Houser says it’s also likely officials won’t focus as much on capturing criminals, because those arrests require more legwork and manpower.
“They’re going to grab the person that’s easily removable, because that will give them the numbers and the imagery,” he says.
4.4 million
The number of US citizens under the age of 18 with at least one undocumented parent, according to Pew Research Center estimates.
Immigrant rights advocates say this figure gets at one of the big impacts of any major deportation operation, noting that these children are often attending schools and are part of communities outside their households. And they point out that whether or not officials hit the higher numerical targets they’ve promised, the impact of any deportations on families and communities would be devastating.
We saw smaller-scale versions of what this can look like during the first Trump administration.
After ICE arrested nearly 700 people in raids at seven Mississippi chicken plants in 2019, a local gym opened its doors to kids who’d gotten off their school buses and discovered their parents were missing. TV crews filmed traumatized and desperate kids at the scene, pleading for authorities to release their parents.
After a meatpacking plant raid in rural Tennessee in 2018, 500 kids missed school the next day.
“It was like a bomb had gone off — helicopters flying overhead, children riding the bus home to empty homes, and families desperately trying to find information about their loved ones who were detained — and the effects on the community were felt for years,” says Lisa Sherman Luna, executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.
Asked by “60 Minutes” whether there’s a way to carry out mass deportation without separating families, Homan offered a swift response.
“Of course there is,” he said. “Families can be deported together.”

8.3 million
The number of undocumented immigrants in the US workforce, according to the Pew Research Center. That’s 5% of the workforce. And the share of undocumented workers is particularly high in certain industries, including construction, agriculture and service.
Economists have been warning that any major deportation effort would have a significant impact far beyond any one particular workplace.
“The economy as a whole downsizes to the detriment of everyone,” says Michael Ettlinger, a senior fellow at the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire.
“Removing people that we know are here and working would be shooting ourselves in the foot economically,” Collins says, noting that the impact of immigrant workers also includes what they spend, not just what they earn.
“Anyone who is here and working is also getting haircuts and eating at restaurants and buying groceries and doing lots of things that grow the economy more,” she says.
$96.7 billion
The estimated amount of taxes undocumented immigrants pay annually, according to the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
According to Zeke Hernandez of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, such estimates show that undocumented immigrants make a significant contribution – something governments would miss out on if they’re deported. But Hernandez, author of “The Truth About Immigration: Why Successful Societies Welcome Newcomers,” argues that talking about the taxes these immigrants pay only paints part of the picture.
“The other tax that governments miss out on, which is usually not talked about, are the taxes that businesses would have paid had they been able to expand and grow. … When a business can’t hire and has to either contract or not grow, it will have less profits and less revenue, and therefore pay less in corporate taxes,” he says.
Critics of illegal immigration argue that the cost to US citizens is far outweighed by any taxes undocumented immigrants pay. The Federation for American Immigration Reform, which argues for increasing immigration restrictions, estimates Americans pay more than $150 billion annually due to illegal immigration.
The organization also argues that mass deportation would make more jobs available for Americans.
But Hernandez says history has shown that’s not the case.
A study based on an analysis of deportations that occurred during the Obama-era “Secure Communities” program, for example, indicates 88,000 US-born workers would lose jobs for every 1 million unauthorized immigrants deported.
Why would deportations hurt US-born workers?
Businesses end up investing less in growing or creating new companies, and more in technologies that replace lower-skilled workers, Hernandez says.
The recent study provides a telling example, he says, of how large-scale deportation efforts have ripple effects beyond immigrant communities. The economic impact of mass deportation, he says, would amount to “utter disaster.”
“We Americans, we, the country, we, in our communities, would be significantly damaged,” he says.

120,General Politics,2024,11,California governor calls special session to protect liberal policies from Trump presidency,Associated Press,"Sacramento, California (AP) — California’s Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, a fierce critic of former President Donald Trump, on Thursday called for lawmakers to convene a special session later this year to safeguard the state’s progressive policies on climate change, reproductive rights and immigration ahead of another Trump presidency.
The move — a day after the former president resoundingly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race — effectively reignited California’s resistance campaign against conservative policies that state Democratic leaders started during the first Trump administration.
“The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack — and we won’t sit idle,” Newsom, who reportedly has ambitions on the national stage, said in a statement. “California has faced this challenge before, and we know how to respond. We are prepared to fight in the courts, and we will do everything necessary to ensure Californians have the support and resources they need to thrive.”
Newsom’s office told The Associated Press that the governor and lawmakers are ready to “Trump-proof” California’s state laws. His announcement Thursday called on the Legislature to give the attorney general’s office more funding to fight federal challenges when they meet in December.
California’s move is part of a growing discussion among Democratic state officials across the country seeking to protect policies that face threats under Trump’s leadership. Other blue states are also moving quickly to prepare game plans and expect a fiercer battle this time around with a Republican-dominated Senate and possibly House.
In New York, Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James said senior staffers plan to meet regularly to coordinate legal strategies.
“Our team will do whatever we have to do to identify any possible threats to these rights that we hold dear in the State of New York and protect New Yorkers,” Hochul said at a news conference Wednesday.
Hochul said she has created a task force focused on developing policy responses to “key areas that are most likely to face threats from the Trump administration” such as “reproductive rights, civil rights, immigration, gun safety, labor rights, LGBTQ rights and our environmental justice.”
Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, who as state attorney general filed dozens of lawsuits against Trump during his first term, said they will “have to see if he makes good on what he promised and ran on in terms of Project 2025 or other things.”
Attorney General Andrea Campbell said she and other attorneys general are “absolutely cleareyed that president-elect Trump has told us exactly what he intends to do as president.”
In Chicago, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said he’s working with other governors to find ways to bolster reproductive rights, among other things.
“Chaos, retribution and disarray radiated from the White House the last time Donald Trump occupied it,” Pritzker said at a Thursday news conference. “Perhaps this time may be different. But if it isn’t, Illinois will remain a place of stability and competent governance.”
After Trump’s win, Newsom vowed to work with the president-elect but added, “Let there be no mistake, we intend to stand with states across our nation to defend our Constitution and uphold the rule of law.”
California was home to the so-called Trump resistance during his time in office, and Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America.
Trump called the Democratic governor “New-scum” during a campaign stop in Southern California last month and has relentlessly lambasted the Democratic stronghold and nation’s most populous state over its large number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, its homeless population and its thicket of regulations.
Trump also waded into a water rights battle over the endangered delta smelt that has pitted environmentalists against farmers and threatened to withhold federal aid to a state increasingly under threat from wildfires.
In a speech Wednesday morning, Trump vowed to follow through with his campaign promise of carrying out the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status and prosecuting his political enemies.
Democrats, which hold every statewide office in California and have commanding margins in the Legislature and congressional delegation, outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1 statewide and Harris easily carried the state in her losing presidential bid.
Newsom and Democratic lawmakers said they are acting now to shield the state’s policies that have made it a leader in the nation.
“We learned a lot about former President Trump in his first term — he’s petty, vindictive, and will do what it takes to get his way no matter how dangerous the policy may be,” state Senate President Pro Tempore Mike McGuire said in a statement. “California has come too far and accomplished too much to simply surrender and accept his dystopian vision for America.”
Newsom has called California a sanctuary for people in other states seeking abortions. The state has passed dozens of laws to protect abortion access, including setting aside $20 million in taxpayer money to help pay for patients in other states to travel to California to get an abortion. Newsom also leads a coalition of 20 Democratic governors launched in 2023 to strengthen abortion access.
The state was also the first to mandate that all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in California be electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids by 2035 and give state regulators the power to penalize oil companies for making too much money. California also extends state-funded health care to all low-income residents regardless of their immigration status.
State Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office spent the past year reviewing more than 120 lawsuits the state filed during Trump’s first term in preparation of new federal actions.
With Trump’s White House win and California’s assumed role in leading the renewed resistance movement, Newsom also is bound to be elevated onto the short list of any presidential consideration for 2028, Sonoma State University political science professor David McCuan said.
The governor, who won’t be eligible to run for governor again when his term ends in January 2027, will have the next two years to prove himself as an effective GOP antidote while maintaining a working relationship with the president-elect.
“He wants to be seen as a political revivalist, and so that puts him front and center,” McCuan said.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/politics/california-governor-special-session-trump-presidency/index.html
121,General Politics,2024,11,Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly announces cancer diagnosis,Annie Grayer,"CNN
 — 
Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly has esophagus cancer, the longtime Virginia congressman announced in a statement Thursday.
“It was a surprise because, except for some intermittent abdominal aches and pains, I had no symptoms,” Connolly, 74, said. “I’m going to undergo chemotherapy and immunotherapy right away. Cancer can be tough. But so am I. I will attack this the only way I know how – with Irish fight and humor.”
Connolly represents Virginia’s 11th congressional district, an affluent and diverse area in northern Virginia and the suburbs of DC. He’s held the seat since 2009 and was reelected to his ninth term on Tuesday after handily defeating Republican Mike Van Meter, a Navy veteran and former FBI agent, in the heavily blue district.
Connolly sits on the House Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees. As a ranking Democratic member on a subcommittee on government innovation, Connolly is involved in government investments with federal contractors, a key component of the local economy he represents. He sponsored bills to change how the federal government buys technology and reduce the number of reports that federal agencies had to disclose.
Representing a diverse population, especially a large population of Asian Americans, Connolly is involved in directing international policy, sitting on subcommittees specifically focused on Asia and the Middle East. He has criticized the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, suggesting that the US “cannot continue to provide offensive weaponry to a government if it refuses to respect the laws of war” but acknowledging that Israel faces significant threats from regional actors like Hamas and Hezbollah.
In November 2020, Connolly was elected president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, where he has focused on strengthening the US presence within NATO.
Connolly is a strong critic of Donald Trump, voting to impeach the president-elect and denouncing his language against immigrants.

122,General Politics,2024,11,Military judge overrules defense secretary and says plea deals for alleged 9/11 conspirators are valid,Haley Britzky,"CNN
 — 
A military judge ruled on Wednesday that plea agreements between the alleged 9/11 conspirators at Guantanamo Bay and the US government are “valid and enforceable,” a defense official told CNN – roughly three months after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin revoked the deals.
The ruling allows for the plea deals to go forward and could mean the men will eventually be sentenced to life in prison and avoid death sentences.
The US reached a plea deal with alleged 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other defendants accused of plotting the attacks in July after more than two years of negotiations. But just days later, Austin revoked the plea deals and yanked responsibility from the convening authority for military commissions who runs the military courts at Guantanamo.
“Part of his ruling was not only are they legal and enforceable,” the defense official told CNN, “but that [Austin] was too late in doing that.”
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said Wednesday that as Austin’s memo said in August, “the Secretary determined that the decision on whether to enter into a pretrial agreement in the 9/11 military commission cases is one of such significance that it was appropriate for responsibility to rest with him as the superior convening authority.”
“We are reviewing the decision and don’t have anything further at this time,” Ryder said in a statement.
The judge, Col. Matthew McCall, said Thursday at the start of a pre-trial hearing that he expected the accused would be able to submit their guilty pleas as early as November 14 or 15, following the conclusion of witness testimony on another matter. That will largely entail McCall discussing the allegations with the defendants to ensure they are clear about what they are pleading guilty to and are doing so willingly.
The American Civil Liberties Union lauded Wednesday’s ruling.
“As a nation, we must move forward with the plea process and a sentencing hearing that is intended to give victim family members answers to their questions,” ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said in a statement. “They deserve transparency and finality about the events that claimed their loved ones.”
The New York Times first reported on the judge’s ruling.
Austin said at the time he was withdrawing from the pre-trial agreements, which were taking the death penalty off the table for Mohammed, also known as KSM, and Walid Bin ‘Attash and Mustafa Ahmed Adam al Hawsawi. The deals had prompted a fierce backlash, including from both sides of the political aisle and some groups representing 9/11 victims who have pushed for the US government to pursue the death penalty.
At pre-trial hearings just days after Austin’s revocation of the plea deal, the defendants’ attorneys argued that Austin’s decision was “corrupt” and violated the military’s own commission regulations that say the convening authority can withdraw a pretrial agreement before the accused begins “performance of promises.” Attorneys argued that their clients had already begun those performances.
“We have had an unprecedented act by a government official to pull back what was a valid agreement. … For us, it raises very serious questions about continuing to engage in a system that seems so obviously corrupt and rigged,” Walter Ruiz, defense counsel for Hawsawi, said at the time.
The defense official said that the government prosecutors in the 9/11 trials “did not expect” the judge’s ruling on Wednesday.
Some victim families pushed back on the plea deals at the time, and on Thursday, the head of one organization that represents 9/11 survivors and victim family members called this week’s news of the deals a “distraction.”
“While some may disagree, even in our own community, I don’t think the Biden admin should have worked to cut these deals in the first place,” Brett Eagleson, president of 9/11 Justice, said in a statement provided to CNN. “It doesn’t do a single thing to ease our pain [or] bring us closure. Nobody has listened to what we actually want/need and that is closure.”
Experts said this summer that the plea deal could have been the best option to avoid a long and drawn out trial against the conspirators, particularly Mohammed.
“They were still in pre-trial hearings,” Peter Bergen, a terrorism expert and CNN national security analyst, said at the time. “Getting some kind of deal is better.”
The military trial against Mohammed and his alleged co-conspirators has been delayed for years as the US tried to determine how to handle the issue of torture used against Mohammed and others at secret CIA prisons in the 2000s. The issue posed a legal problem for prosecutors about whether evidence obtained through torture was admissible in court.
While the terms of the pre-trial agreement have not been made public, attorneys for the defendants said at the hearings in August that detainees would have answered questions from families of 9/11 victims as a part of the deal. Gary Sowards, a defense attorney for Mohammed, said in court that families had already begun “submitting questions in good faith.”
Wells Dixon, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights who represented Majid Khan at Guantanamo Bay — another detainee, who was convicted on terrorism charges in 2012 — told CNN in August that it was highly unlikely prosecutors ever achieved a death penalty sentence. Largely in part, he said, because the government is “unwilling” to admit evidence in trial “about the defendant’s torture.”
“If Secretary Austin says that a 9/11 case is going to proceed to trial, and a verdict, and possibly a sentencing,” Dixon told CNN, “then he is either hopelessly ill-informed or is lying to victim family members.”

123,General Politics,2024,11,Trump’s allies are already jockeying for high-powered spots in his administration,Kristen Holmes,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump’s allies are quickly jockeying for positions in a new Trump administration on the heels of his decisive victory, sources familiar with the matter told CNN, pitting loyalists against each other to land top roles in the new government.
Those with particular positions in mind have begun reaching out to members of Trump’s inner circle to try and talk themselves up. Trump, who is known to be superstitious, largely avoided these conversations in recent weeks, despite allies who believed they proved their loyalty trying to position themselves favorably.
Many hopefuls were at Trump’s victory parties in Florida Tuesday night and delayed their flights or adjusted their travel schedules to remain in the Palm Beach area. Trump could announce his decision on some key positions within days, sources told CNN.
Trump has also prepared a raft of executive orders, policy papers and regulation reversals to go on day one of taking office, according to sources, describing a president-elect who is focused on what he’ll do immediately after taking the oath of office.
Ahead of the election, transition heads Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon met with some potential candidates for high-ranking positions within the administration to discuss what that would look like, sources familiar with the meetings told CNN.
Occasionally over the past few months, Trump would float names as possible administration picks, but he would not engage further. Sources close to the former president said that because he was superstitious, Trump often refused to engage in lengthier conversations about who would be placed in an administration before the election took place.
Now Trump can’t ignore the decisions about who will staff the key roles in his administration tasked with implementing the president-elect’s sweeping plans to remake the federal government.
During private conversations in the last few days, Trump has made one thing clear: He wants to reward those who stood by him during the last two years of his presidential bid.
Trump has said he regretted many of the people he put in senior roles when he won the White House in 2016, angry with top aides and Cabinet officials who tried to thwart his often-impulsive demands and desires. Many of the loyalists lining up for positions say they intend to operate in the new administration free of any officials who will undercut Trump.
During the campaign, the president-elect fiercely distanced himself from Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation effort to map out a sweeping agenda for the new Trump administration, along with vetting hundreds of people who could join the federal government and were deemed loyal to Trump.
John McEntee, a Trump ally who served as director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office and remains close to him, helmed the personnel operation – which is expected to provide recommendations to the transition for administration posts. Cliff Sims, another top aide during his first term, and Ross Werner, a former Pentagon and Goldman Sachs official, have also assisted with vetting.
Some advisers have proposed a work around to traditional background checks conducted for specific White House jobs that would allow for a quicker installation of loyalists into the administration, according to two sources briefed on the proposal. Some of Trump’s hires during his first administration were held up or thwarted due to lengthy and in-depth background checks, which could be a problem again this time around.
The West Wing
One of Trump’s most important picks will be his White House chief of staff. During his first term, Trump churned through four chiefs of staff, including John Kelly, who said last month that Trump fits “into the general definition of fascist.”
There are at least three people being floated as potential chiefs of staff for the new Trump administration. That list includes his 2024 co-campaign manager, Susie Wiles, who sources close to Trump believe is the frontrunner. Wiles remained loyal to Trump when several Republicans tried to distance themselves from him after he left the White House in 2021.
“She makes him feel comfortable,” one source close to Trump said of Wiles.
Russ Vought, Trump’s former budget director who oversaw a widespread push to deregulate, could find himself in pole position if Trump decides to embrace the pillars of Project 2025, which Vought co-authored.
The list of potential White House chiefs also includes CEO of the America First Policy Institute, Brooke Rollins, and Bob Lighthizer, Trump’s former US trade representative.
Karoline Leavitt, who was Trump’s campaign spokeswoman, is being considered as White House press secretary – a job that typically is the most public-facing position in the White House.
Musk and RFK Jr.
One of the key decisions Trump will have to make is what to do with the high-profile but polarizing supporters who boosted his campaign in the final months, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X.
It’s not clear yet whether either could be confirmed by the Senate for a Cabinet position – a question that may be decided by the ultimate margin that Republicans have next year.
Musk, whose pro-Trump super PAC spent more than $118 million in the 2024 campaign, has pitched himself to lead a broad effort to slash spending inside the federal government.
A source familiar with the conversations around Musk said it seemed unlikely that he would even want a full-time government position, given what that would mean for his role in the various companies he helms.
Instead, it seemed more plausible that Musk would be appointed to a blue-ribbon committee where he would still have enormous access, but he would not be subject to government ethics rules, which would require him to divest or put assets in a blind trust to avoid conflicts of interest between his private business interests and government role.
While the president-elect continues to praise Kennedy publicly, advisers have acknowledged that he has caused some headaches for the campaign. An interview Wednesday further exacerbated that concern, when Kennedy was continually pressed on his stance on vaccines, just hours after Trump won the presidency in an historic political comeback.
“That is not what we want people focused on today,” a source close to Trump said of the exchange.
The Kennedy and Trump teams have been discussing the potential for a czar-like position with a broad remit and direct, regular access to the president. His wide-ranging interests – addiction, nutrition, mental health, vaccines, and the environment – span multiple agencies including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture.
Inside Trump’s camp, questions have been raised about whether Kennedy could get confirmed or obtain a security clearance necessary for a Cabinet-level position. And even if he could, they doubt Kennedy would want to go through those processes.
“If you dump a bear in Central Park and think you’re above the law, you don’t want to have to go through that gauntlet of political correctness,” said a former Trump official briefed on the discussions.
Immigration and the law
Roles overseeing immigration and law enforcement will be central in Trump’s ability to advance an agenda that he has suggested will include mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and prosecutions of his political enemies. Many Trump loyalists have suggested those are mandates his departments of Justice and Homeland Security should carry out.
Among those being floated for attorney general, which Trump has suggested will be among the most important roles he fills: Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general who, like Trump, was both indicted and impeached; Matt Whitaker, who served in an acting capacity after Trump fired then-AG Jeff Sessions; Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, and former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. Conservative attorney Mark Paoletta has been pitched directly to Trump, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Kash Patel, a former Trump national security official who is helping organize the next administration’s transition, spent Wednesday taking meetings and calls at a Palm Beach County office from a flood of people interested in jobs in the incoming administration, according to a former Trump administration official involved in the process. Patel is helping to manage a somewhat chaotic process with multiple Trump campaign officials pushing lists of potential nominees for key jobs.
Patel and Trump are both vowing to oust officials who played any role in investigations of Trump and his supporters. Trump has vowed to fire Christopher Wray, who Trump appointed in 2017 after firing James Comey, and whose 10-year term has more than two years remaining. Jeffrey Jensen, a former Trump-appointed US attorney in St. Louis, is among the names being considered to run the FBI.
Then-Attorney General Bill Barr appointed Jensen in 2020 to review several politically sensitive prosecutions, including the one of Michael Flynn, the former Trump national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI before Barr ordered the case to be dropped.
National security posts
Trump has suggested his national security team would be tasked with reassessing the United States’ posture toward Ukraine and Russia, China, Iran, and the simmering conflict in the Middle East. The debate over a renewed Trump’s “America First” agenda is expected to pit Republican national security hawks against the party’s isolationist wing.
Secretary of state and national security adviser will be among the most hard-fought positions to stand at the forefront of those shifts.
For Foggy Bottom, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a China hawk and finalist for Trump’s VP, is under consideration, as is Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty, who served as Trump’s ambassador to Japan during his first term.
Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist and former ambassador to Germany, has also been floated for the position, though he could end up in a number of potential slots. Grenell is one of several Trump loyalists who is seen as a shoo-in for a position, with questions over the particular role. Grenell was Trump’s acting director of national intelligence for several months in 2020 and has also been suggested for a role such as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, where he may be urged by Trump to unearth the so-called “deep state.”
Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, Keith Kellogg, and Ratcliffe are also in the mix for intelligence or national security roles.
Patel himself has told associates that he wants to be CIA director, people briefed on the matter say. It would be a triumph after Trump contemplated in his final months in office putting Patel in key jobs at FBI or CIA. That idea was blocked by opposition from then CIA Director Gina Haspel and Barr.
Cotton is also among those being floated for secretary of defense, in addition to Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Rep. Elise Stefanik, the New York Republican who is House GOP Conference Chair, is being strongly considered as United Nations ambassador, and has been mentioned for CIA. She’s met with the transition team about the prospect of the UN role.
A number of others are also being floated for the UN ambassador job, including former State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, former US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman and Kelly Craft, who was the UN ambassador at the end of Trump’s first term.
Economic roles
To promote his economic platform of broad-brush tariffs and tax cuts, Trump is expected to lean on longtime allies and loyalists, while tapping into Wall Street heavyweights to round out his domestic agencies.
There are several names being batted around for Treasury secretary. They include Scott Bessent, who prepared Trump for his economic club speeches.
“He’s a former Soros guy who captured the MAGA movement. The president loves that, former Democrats that he’s flipped. That’s why he loves Elon so much,” said a source familiar with the matter.
John Paulson, a hedge fund billionaire and megadonor, is also under consideration. Jay Clayton, a former chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is seen as a “dark horse,” according to one source.
Lighthizer has also expressed interest in the Treasury post. Both Lighthizer and McMahon are also under consideration to run the Commerce Department.
North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who was a finalist to be Trump’s vice-presidential pick, is being floated as interior secretary.
At the Office of the US Trade Representative – a once-sleepy outfit across the street from the White House – the Trump team is looking for someone who wouldn’t flinch at his often mercurial whims on tariff policy. Jamieson Greer, who served as Lighthizer’s deputy when Trump instituted across-the-board tariffs on adversaries and allies alike, is the name sources raise most often for this role.

124,General Politics,2024,11,Hill Republicans ready ambitious agenda as they hope for full sweep of Washington,Sarah Ferris,"CNN
 — 
Republicans on Capitol Hill are laying the groundwork to push through an ambitious agenda with President-elect Donald Trump if they have total control of Washington next January – a rare GOP trifecta that party leaders believe is now within reach.
And this time they’ll be prepared to use it.
Unlike Trump’s surprise win in 2016, House and Senate GOP leaders have been preparing for months for a possible GOP sweep. Their goal is to get to work quickly drafting big pieces of the Trump administration’s agenda, starting with a major economic package centered on taxes, energy policy, border security and deregulation, according to two people familiar with discussions.
“We have already started working on it because we realized how harmful a massive tax increase would be in 2026,” GOP Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, told CNN.
With Republicans winning control of the Senate, delivering on Trump’s agenda will come down to whether the GOP retains a majority in the House. CNN has not yet made a projection in the battle for control of the House, with votes still being counted in dozens of races. But key pickups in Pennsylvania and Michigan have party leaders hopeful that a full sweep is in sight and senior Republicans feel confident they will hold onto their slim majority.
Speaker Mike Johnson, who has consolidated power by promoting his closeness to Trump, has spoken directly with the president-elect many times about what they can accomplish in a GOP majority, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Johnson and his leadership team have spent months holding policy meetings with committee leaders and Senate stakeholders while preparing broad strokes of major legislation that they could muscle through Congress without Democratic votes — the same way President Joe Biden did with Democrats two years ago.
Even with unified GOP control, there would be challenges ahead for Republicans. One issue is the political math: House Republicans believe if they do hold onto the majority, it won’t be by much. Johnson — who would be expected to keep his position as speaker — would only have a few votes to spare. And their current, narrow majority, has been plagued by divisions and roadblocks.
But Trump will be returning to a Washington where both chambers will be stacked with his allies. The House GOP conference has become decidedly more “Trumpian” in the last four years as his grip over the party has grown stronger, as one Republican put it. And Trump’s victory — with the president-elect holding the popular vote lead — is also putting new weight behind his agenda in GOP circles.
“The Republican controlled Congress will do a much better job of governing under President Trump because we know he has a mandate from the most diverse group of Americans ever assembled,” GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNN.
Johnson formally launched his bid to keep his job as speaker on Wednesday in a letter sent to Republican lawmakers obtained by CNN. In the letter, Johnson laid out how House Republicans plan to work closely with Trump.
“To truly make America great again, we will need to begin delivering for the people on day one. In preparation, we have worked diligently for the past year to be ready with a priority list of key conservative policy wins that we can achieve together with our Senate Republican colleagues, working hand-in-hand with the new Trump Administration,” Johnson wrote.
In a sign of the backchanneling and direct communication between Trump’s orbit and congressional allies to come, two key Trump allies, Mark Meadows and Steve Bannon, are expected to brief Republicans in the coming days about the upcoming transition, one source familiar with the planning told CNN.
GOP leaders have been dreaming of another major tax package, as many tax provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025. Also on the table: potentially rolling back parts of President Joe Biden’s signature Inflation Reduction Act, a sweeping economic and climate bill that Democrats passed when they had unified government earlier in Biden’s first term, one source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
House Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee have been meeting in working groups for months trying to iron out changes they would make to existing tax policy, Republican New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis told CNN.
“It makes sense to start early and do our homework,” Malliotakis said.
The GOP messaging strategy – attacking Democrats over the cost of living, crime and the border – that has so far delivered wins in key House races across the country has also emboldened lawmakers to pursue an agenda focused on those issues.
“With a 53 or 54 seat majority, and a Republican majority in the House, you do whatever you can do,“ one Senate GOP aide told CNN about the plans underway for if the GOP wins full control.
Republicans also see an opening for other big-ticket items like the House GOP’s hardline immigration proposals that have been stalled since passing their chamber last year as Senate Democrats and the Biden White House had strongly opposed that plan.
But it wouldn’t be easy to clear a huge package through a narrowly divided House even if Republicans control all the levers of power. There are procedural hurdles, since Republicans would need to squeeze each piece of their legislation through the Senate’s wonky budget rules, which will limit how much policy unrelated to the budget they can actually pass.
Internally, Republicans are eying a strategy deployed by Democrats two years ago — Biden and then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi held together a fragile coalition in Congress essentially by making sure there was something to like for everyone.
“We learned a lot of lessons from the Dems. How do you pass a major piece of legislation? Make sure everybody gets a bite,” one senior GOP aide put it.
“Dems showed how effective reconciliation can be. So I think you’re going to see a push to do something similar,” the aide said, referring to a procedural move that can allow lawmakers to bypass the 60-vote threshold typically required to move legislation forward in the Senate.
Johnson, if he maintains control of the House, will have plenty else to deal with in 2025 besides the tax deadline, including steering Congress away from a debt limit cliff, which could hit in early summer.
And there could be even more left-over items from this year’s lame-duck session. Congress still needs to confront deadlines for must-pass bills, like a year-end spending bill and the farm bill, a massive package of nutrition and agriculture programs.
Senate Republicans will also need to move rapidly in the new year to confirm Trump’s Cabinet and nominees, a process that could take considerable time.
Top of mind for Johnson and his GOP leadership team is the government funding fight.
Before the current Congress ends, Johnson will need to corral his razor-thin majority through the spending battle — which is set to happen just before Christmas — where Democrats will likely use the process as their last chance to nab any political wins if in fact Republicans hold onto the chamber.
It’s not clear yet whether Johnson would try to finish that spending bill during the lame duck — which would clear the decks for Trump’s incoming administration — or punt it until the next session of Congress when Republicans might control both chambers.
And some of his own members may be emboldened by Trump’s clear victory.
Another high-profile Trump ally, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, warned that Republicans who stood in Trump’s way in his first term will not have the runway to do so again.
“I will not let them and neither will the American people who have given us this amazing opportunity to save this country,” Greene posted on X.

125,General Politics,2024,11,"Trump critic-turned-ally JD Vance elected vice president, offering glimpse at GOP’s potential future",Eric Bradner,"CNN
 — 
Just two years after winning his first run for political office, Ohio Sen. JD Vance is set to become vice president — ushering a new generation into power and offering a potential glimpse at the Republican Party’s future after President-elect Donald Trump’s second term ends.
Vance, 40, was the first millennial on a major party’s presidential ticket and will become the third-youngest vice president in American history.
He is also a former Trump critic whose political evolution, culminating in him becoming the president-elect’s running mate, showcases how Trump has taken over the GOP and reshaped it in his own image.

Raised by his grandparents in southeastern Ohio as his mother battled drug addiction, Vance joined the Marine Corps after high school, and later went on to attend Ohio State University and Yale Law School — where he met his wife, Usha Vance — and become a venture capitalist.
His 2016 memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” shot Vance to stardom in a nation seeking to understand the Rust Belt appeal of Trump, who first won the presidency that same year. At the time, as he emerged as a political commentator, Vance was a strident Trump critic.
In private messages, Vance wondered ahead of Trump’s first election whether he was “America’s Hitler” and in 2017 said the then-president was a “moral disaster.” In public, he agreed Trump was a “total fraud” who didn’t care about regular people and called him “reprehensible.”
He changed his tune later, fully embracing Trump by 2020. After courting Trump in person at Mar-a-Lago and through Fox News appearances, he earned the former president’s endorsement in the late stages of a competitive Republican primary in Ohio’s Senate race in 2022. Vance, in his first run for office, went on to win that race.
In a display of loyalty, Vance was one of several potential running mates and Republican lawmakers to stand by Trump’s side at a New York courthouse during his criminal hush money trial earlier this year.

He’s also made clear that his view of the constitutional limits on a vice president’s role in certifying election results differs from that of former Vice President Mike Pence, who drew the ire of Trump in January 2021, when he opted not to interfere in the process of approving electoral votes for Joe Biden.
In Congress, Vance has been a vocal opponent of foreign aid, opposing legislation to send more aid from the US to Ukraine amid Russia’s war.
He has embraced conservative culture wars, sponsoring legislation targeting gender-affirming care for transgender minors and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. But he has also taken populist positions, supporting tariffs, opposing corporate mergers and working with Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.
How Trump picked Vance
Trump sought to maintain drama in his search for a running mate, delaying his selection until after the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania, and on the first day of the Republican National Convention.
The two had met at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club the same day Trump was shot in the ear. Then, two days later, Trump called Vance to offer him a spot on the ticket. He announced his pick 20 minutes later on Truth Social.
Ahead of Trump’s selection, the Ohio senator’s supporters, including Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. and conservative media figure Tucker Carlson, had argued that Vance had the strongest relationship with Trump of a group of finalists that also included Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, and that he would be the most loyal selection, multiple sources familiar with the discussions said.

They made the case that Vance can appeal to working-class voters viewed as essential to winning the key battleground states in November, given his upbringing in a poor Rust Belt town in Ohio. They also pointed to his wife, Usha Vance — the child of Indian immigrants — as being someone who could appeal to minority voters, the sources said.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, on the convention floor, described Trump’s selection of Vance as “a great day for Ohio.”
“He is consistent with Trump’s appeal to working men and women,” DeWine said, adding that he thought it was wise for Trump to pick someone younger. “Also, someone who shares his desire to expand the base of the Republican Party.”
Controversy on the campaign trail
Vance’s selection led opponents to mine years of podcasts and other interviews that he had participated in. And one of them — a 2021 podcast in which he told Fox News that the Democratic Party was led by “childless cat ladies,” including Vice President Kamala Harris — immediately ignited controversy when it was resurfaced.

Democrats pointed to Vance’s comments as evidence of a GOP hostile to women, in a campaign that saw a sizable gender gap, due in part to Trump’s appointment of conservative Supreme Court justices who would go on to overturn Roe v. Wade’s national abortion rights protections in 2022.
Vance spent weeks explaining that the remarks were not intended to lambast people who do not have children — particularly those who want to but are unable — but rather as a criticism of the Democratic Party as “anti-family.”
Weeks later, he repeated false social media claims about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio — and defended his decision to do so despite the lack of evidence to support those claims, arguing that he was attempting to draw attention to the issue of immigration.
“If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that’s what I’m going to do,” Vance told CNN’s Dana Bash in September.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/politics/jd-vance-elected-vice-president/index.html
126,General Politics,2024,11,What happens to Trump’s criminal and civil cases now that he’s been reelected,Devan Cole,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump has been reelected to the White House as a convicted felon who is awaiting sentencing in his hush money case in New York and still working to stave off prosecution in other state and federal cases.
It’s an extraordinarily unique position for him to be in: Never before has a criminal defendant been elected to the nation’s highest office, just as an ex-president had never been criminally charged until last year.

Trump will win second term, CNN projects, in historic comeback after losing four years ago
Trump has said multiple times he plans to fire special counsel Jack Smith and end the federal cases against him for trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election and mishandling classified documents.
As of Wednesday, Smith is in active talks with Justice Department leadership about how to end the federal cases against Trump, a DOJ official familiar with the discussions told CNN.
“It clearly paid off to aggressively push to delay these cases as long as possible,” said Jessica Levinson, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School.
In the meantime, a judge in New York is set to sentence the former president later this month after holding off on handing down the punishment ahead of Election Day to avoid any appearance of affecting the outcome of the presidential race – though Trump’s lawyers are expected to ask the judge to put off the sentencing now that he’s the president-elect.
Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Here’s what to know about the four criminal cases:
New York sentencing
Trump is scheduled to appear in a New York courtroom on November 26 to receive a sentence for his conviction earlier this year on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment made during the 2016 campaign to adult-film star Stormy Daniels, who alleged a prior affair with the president-elect. (Trump denies the affair.)
Whether that sentencing happens at all remains an open question.
The Trump legal team is going to try to make sure the sentencing does not occur. In the past it has been focused on delaying proceedings in the case, but now it is going to try to get it canceled altogether, according to a source familiar with the strategy.
Trump’s attorneys are expected to enter a filing in the coming days arguing that as a president-elect, he is entitled to the same constitutional protections as a sitting president and should be protected from any action by state prosecutors.
The filing is expected before Judge Juan Merchan’s self-imposed deadline of November 12 to decide whether to wipe away Trump’s conviction because of the Supreme Court’s decision this summer granting a president some presidential immunity. If Merchan decides to wipe away the conviction, the charges would be dismissed, and Trump would not be sentenced.
RELATED ARTICLE
Trump’s second term will look nothing like his first
But if the judge decides to keep the conviction intact, the former president’s lawyers are expected to ask Merchan to delay Trump’s sentencing so they can appeal. And if that’s not granted, his attorneys are planning to appeal the immunity decision to state appellate courts and potentially all the way to the US Supreme Court to ask the courts to delay Trump’s sentencing until all appeals are exhausted, which could take months.
Should Merchan move ahead with sentencing, Trump could be ordered to serve as much as four years of prison time, but the judge is not required to sentence the president-elect to prison, and he could impose a lesser sentence, such as probation, home confinement, community service or a fine.
Any sentence, of course, will be complicated by the fact that Trump is set to take office on January 20, 2025. Trump’s lawyers are likely to shape their appeals to raise constitutional issues challenging whether a state judge can sentence a president-elect, which could tie the case up in courts for years.
Since it is a state case, Trump does not have the power to pardon himself next year after he is sworn into office.
Federal cases in DC and Florida
Trump’s election victory is poised to have the greatest impact on the two federal criminal cases brought against him by Smith in Washington, DC, and Florida.
Since the cases were brought in 2023, Trump’s main legal strategy has been to delay the trials until past the election so that, if elected, he could fire Smith, leading to the end of the two cases. In late October, the former president said he would take such a step without hesitation.
“Oh, it’s so easy. It’s so easy,” Trump said when asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt whether he would “pardon yourself” or “fire Jack Smith” if reelected.
“I would fire him within two seconds,” Trump said.
The discussions between Smith and DOJ leadership are expected to last several days.
Justice Department officials are looking at options for how to wind down the two criminal cases while also complying with a 2020 memo from the department’s Office of Legal Counsel about indictments or prosecutions of sitting presidents.

Can Trump fire Jack Smith if elected? Reporter breaks it down
01:46 - Source: CNN
More than a half-dozen people who are close to the special counsel’s office or other top Justice Department officials previously told CNN they believe Smith doesn’t want to close up shop before being ordered to do so or pushed out by Trump.
Under federal law, Smith must provide a confidential report on his office’s work to the attorney general before he leaves the post.
In the DC case, Smith charged Trump over his efforts to overturn his election loss in 2020. The case was stalled for months as Trump pressed federal courts to grant him presidential immunity, and in July the Supreme Court issued a historic ruling that said he had some immunity from criminal prosecution.
The federal judge overseeing the trial has been deciding how much of Trump’s conduct at the center of the case is shielded by immunity after prosecutors last month laid out their arguments for why the ruling should have no impact on the case.
The charges brought by Smith against the president-elect in Florida accuse Trump of illegally taking classified documents from the White House and resisting the government’s attempts to retrieve the materials. That case was thrown out in July by Judge Aileen Cannon, but prosecutors have appealed her ruling, which said that Attorney General Merrick Garland’s appointment of Smith violated the Constitution.
Georgia RICO case
The immediate fate of Trump’s criminal case in Georgia largely hinges on whether Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, is disqualified from prosecuting the matter after her prior romantic relationship with a fellow prosecutor. But even if she is allowed to continue prosecuting Trump, the case would almost certainly imperiled now that he has been elected.
The criminal charges again Trump for attempting to overturn the 2020 presidential election results are effectively on hold while the appeals court decides whether to disqualify Willis, a decision that is not expected until 2025.

If Willis is removed, sources told CNN they think it’s unlikely another prosecutor will want to take up the case and it will effectively go away.
Sources familiar with the case said it is unlikely that a state-level judge would allow proceedings to continue when Trump is president and, in that scenario, Trump’s attorneys would certainly move to have the case dismissed.
There is no clear answer as to whether a state-level prosecutor, like Willis, can prosecute a sitting president. Trump’s victory now forces Willis to confront that constitutional question in addition to the existing legal issues that have already cast uncertainly over the Georgia case’s future.
Civil suits
The former president is also defending himself in a litany of civil lawsuits, including ones concerning his role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, two E. Jean Carroll defamation cases, and a civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general where Trump was ordered to pay nearly $454 million in damages.
In September, state and federal appeals courts in New York heard arguments for two of Trump’s civil appeals.

Here’s what Trump is proposing for the economy
Trump lost two defamation cases to Carroll in 2023 and 2024 in federal court after a jury found him liable for sexually abusing the onetime columnist and subsequently defaming her. Two juries awarded Carroll $5 million and $83 million.
A federal appeals court heard Trump’s appeal to dismiss the first Carroll verdict in September. The court has yet to issue a decision.
Later in the month, a state appeals court heard arguments in Trump’s efforts to dismiss the $454 million civil fraud judgement against him, in which a judge found he, his adult sons and his company fraudulently inflated the value of Trump’s assets to obtain better loan and insurance rates.
The five-judge appeals court appeared open to at least lowering the fine levied against Trump, though it also has yet to issue a decision. That ruling can be appealed to New York’s highest appellate court.
Trump is also still facing civil lawsuits brought by Democratic lawmakers and others over his role in the January 6 Capitol attack.
It’s possible that all these cases continue to play out even as Trump serves his second term in the White House. In a 1997 Supreme Court ruling stemming from a civil lawsuit then-President Bill Clinton was involved in, the justices unanimously decided that sitting presidents could not invoke presidential immunity to avoid civil litigation while in office.

127,General Politics,2024,11,Leaders rush to pay homage to Trump as they brace for him shaking up the old-world order,Kevin Liptak,"CNN
 — 
In the hours after Donald Trump secured another term in the White House, a familiar exercise was unfolding in foreign capitals. Dusting off their proverbial Trump playbooks, leaders from Paris to Jerusalem to Riyadh and beyond began posting congratulatory messages online and pressing their ambassadors in Washington to find a way — any way — to get in contact with the incoming president directly.
The scramble did not go unnoticed among Trump’s bleary-eyed aides in Florida, who kept close track of who was reaching out — and in what order.
As the world digests the reality of another Trump presidency, the central characteristics of his approach to the world are coming into sharper focus almost immediately. Transactional, personality-based and erratic, the Trump doctrine made for a chaotic four years that left both foreign leaders and seasoned American national security aides exhausted and jittery.
Nothing in Trump’s campaign for president suggests his approach is likely to change. Unlike those years, however, the world is now “on fire,” as Trump likes to say, and he’s promised to extinguish the flames. He has vowed to end Russia’s war in Ukraine in 24 hours and bring peace to the Middle East, all while constraining American foes in North Korea and Iran.
That’s in addition to slapping broad new tariffs on China, reassessing stalwart American defense alliances like NATO and finding countries willing to take the migrants he’s promised to deport en masse.
How he will accomplish any of those goals is uncertain. He did not delve into details of his plans as a candidate, much less confer with American allies about how to approach the problems collectively.
What he did make clear was his distrust of American alliances that have been the backbone of the Western world order, the same one President Joe Biden sought to restore when he took over the presidency from Trump four years ago, declaring “America is back.”
Instead of helping the US achieve its goals, Trump has described the allies as parasitic burdens, no more so than when he encouraged Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries who don’t meet their defense spending targets.
That makes his upcoming return to the global stage one of the most unpredictable factors in an already perilous world, and has foreign leaders both holding their breath while also seeking an in.
Even before Trump’s victory was assured, leaders were writing their congratulations on X. Among the first were Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a Trump friend who later spoke with the president-elect by phone, and French President Emmanuel Macron, whose relationship with Trump during his first term grew badly strained.
The Élysée Palace, Macron’s official office, noted in describing their call that Macron was “among the very first heads of state” to reach Trump: “They had a very warm conversation, building on their strong preexisting relationship,” the palace said.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto leader who the CIA concluded had ordered the killing of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, also spoke with Trump on Wednesday to “reiterate the historic relationship” between their countries.
NATO’s new secretary general Mark Rutte, whose elevation to the job was helped along by the relationship he’d developed with Trump as Dutch prime minister, said he’d congratulated Trump on Tuesday evening. “His leadership will again be key to keeping our alliance strong,” he said, somewhat hopefully.
Scramble to arrange meetings
As leaders were sending congratulatory messages to Trump, their aides are feverishly gaming out how to setup potential meetings with the president-elect in the coming months, multiple sources familiar with the early planning efforts explained. World leaders are open to all options, including making trips to New York or Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, sources said. Many of them are eyeing meetings before Trump’s January inauguration.
Still, even loose plans have not been sketched out for possible meetings. For now, those who have sent congratulatory messages to Trump are awaiting responses from him and his team as they also work to be in contact with people close to Trump, they said.
Foreign leaders are relying on their experience with Trump during his first presidency, when flattery and personal attention paid dividends, as they approach him following his win. One foreign diplomat said there is a better understanding of Trump compared to 2016, which is part of what led to the flood of congratulatory notes even before the race was officially called.
The diplomat said in their view, leaders are following a model set by the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who headed directly to New York following Trump’s victory in 2016 for a meeting at Trump Tower, toting a set of gold-plated golf clubs as a congratulatory gift.
The model they are avoiding is the one adopted by then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who took a direct approach when speaking with Trump without much ego-stroking.
It wasn’t yet clear how or whether some of the authoritarians who Trump openly admired as president would convey their well-wishes. Russian President Vladimir Putin — who tried flattering Trump during his first term and who Trump talks about as a friend — has no plans to congratulate him now, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday.
“Let’s not forget that we are talking about an unfriendly country that is both directly and indirectly involved in the war against our states,” he said.
And if Trump is still receiving “love letters,” as he called them, from North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, neither is revealing their correspondence publicly.
Ultimately, it is those relationships that proved the most alarming for many veterans of Trump’s first presidency, who — after breaking with Trump — described efforts to prevent the US leader from being manipulated by violent autocrats.
Perhaps the most important relationship Trump must now cultivate is with China’s Xi Jinping, who he has described as “a very good friend of mine during my term” but with whom his relationship grew increasingly tense: Trump entered a trade war with China during the first few years of his administration and when Covid-19 began spreading throughout the US, Trump regularly referred to it as the “China virus.”
Since Trump was last in office, Xi has deepened his relationship with Putin though meetings and visits, creating a dynamic Biden officials believe could be meant to challenge US authority.
On Wednesday, Xi congratulated Trump in a phone call, according to two sources familiar with the conversation.
As American officials work to assess whether Xi has near-term designs on Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as its own, Trump suggested last month that a combination of withering tariffs and general insanity might prevent an invasion.
“He respects me and he knows I’m f***ing crazy,” he told the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board when asked whether he would use military force to protect Taiwan.
And that, in the end, could sum up Trump’s foreign policy doctrine in a sentence.
Veterans of Trump’s first term describe a foreign policy approach untethered to the processes most US presidents adopted to make consequential decisions about world affairs. Trump developed policy on the fly, sometimes based on conversations his aides only learned about afterward, and announced his decisions on social media.
That at times led to tense meetings, shouting matches or the unsavory task of telling Trump why his decisions wouldn’t work.
Trump could bring in advisers more willing to break with norms
As he returns to the Oval Office, people around Trump expect he will select individuals to serve in his administration who will be better prepared to execute his directives, no matter how chaotic they may be decided or delivered.
It’s not out of the question that some veterans of Trump’s first time in office could return to serve in different posts, including Mike Pompeo, who served as secretary of state; Keith Kellogg, who acted as National Security Adviser to Vice President Mike Pence; or Richard Grenell, Trump’s ambassador to Germany who later served as acting director of national intelligence.
Brian Hook, a top State Department official during the first Trump administration, is expected to lead Trump’s transition team at the State Department, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
But Trump is also likely to look outside his first administration for advisers who are willing to go further than his team did back then and be less concerned about breaking international norms or rules.
Who Trump selects for top national security posts will go a long way in determining what type of foreign policy he will execute, particularly in Ukraine, where the Republican Party has been somewhat divided in how best to wield American support.
“It is difficult to anticipate Trump’s policy on the war because his team contains personnel with very different views,” said John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center and a former US ambassador to Ukraine. “One group advocates sharply reducing aid to Ukraine—a view many associate with Trump. This group is naive about the Kremlin’s policy toward the United States—Putin states plainly that the United States is adversary number one—and clueless about the danger of a Kremlin victory in Ukraine.”
“The other camp recognizes the threat to US interests in Europe and elsewhere if Washington were to abandon Ukraine,” Herbst went on. “This group would pursue a Reaganesque policy of peace through strength and, unlike the Biden team, not be intimidated by Putin’s nuclear bluster. The first clues about Trump’s policy will be the appointments he makes to senior national security positions.”

128,General Politics,2024,11,Here’s what Trump is proposing for the economy,Katie Lobosco,"Washington
CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump on the campaign trail laid out a broad array of ideas aimed at providing tax relief, cutting prices, hiking tariffs and strengthening the economy, which ranks at the top of voters’ concerns.
Nearly all of the measures, which lack detail, would require congressional approval. That could be tough to achieve in the partisan climate on Capitol Hill.
Here’s what you need to know about what Trump has said he’ll do to address the economy:
Tackle expiring tax cuts
Some parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of Trump’s signature achievements during his time in the White House, are scheduled to lapse at the end of 2025.
RELATED ARTICLE

While the law reduced taxes for most people, Democrats often criticize the TCJA for disproportionately benefiting the wealthy.
Trump wants to extend all the individual income and estate tax cuts that the 2017 law provided. This includes, among other things, an increase to the standard deduction, lower marginal income tax rates for most income brackets, and an increase to the estate tax exemption.
Trump has suggested he would get rid of the cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, but the controversial cap expires at the end of 2025.
Additionally, Trump has called for lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% for certain companies. The TJCA permanently lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Trump would also restore companies’ ability to immediately deduct investments in equipment and research.
Eliminate taxes
The president-elect has rolled out a series of targeted tax breaks, including eliminating federal taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay.
Trump has promised an end to taxes on tips. Though his campaign hasn’t released details on the proposal, Trump has indicated that he would eliminate both federal income taxes and payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare.
RELATED ARTICLE
Trump’s second term will look nothing like his first
Virtually all tipped workers would get some tax relief if Trump also gets rid of payroll taxes on tips, the Tax Policy Center found. However, these workers would then get smaller Social Security payments after they retire.
Seeking to appeal to senior citizens, a dedicated voting bloc, Trump has vowed that Social Security recipients would no longer have to pay taxes on the monthly benefits they receive. Around half of beneficiaries – mainly those with higher incomes – pay federal income tax on their Social Security payments.
In addition, Trump has proposed jettisoning taxes on overtime pay, though his campaign has not provided any details. However, if workers don’t owe payroll taxes on their overtime compensation, they could receive less from Social Security in retirement.
If enacted, all three of these measures could reduce the taxes that help fund Social Security, which could deplete the program’s trust funds by 2031 and force a roughly 30% cut in benefits for enrollees if the revenue is not replaced, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Trump has also floated ending the federal income tax and replacing it with revenue from tariffs.
Help the middle class
The former president unveiled on the campaign trail several measures aimed at helping Americans afford the cost of living.
He has said he would temporarily cap credit card interest rates at around 10%, which is less than half the current rate.
And Trump promised to make the interest paid on car loans fully tax deductible, similar to the popular existing deduction for mortgage interest. While he argues this will stimulate car ownership, some experts say it will mainly help wealthier Americans who itemize their deductions – and who typically buy more expensive cars.
To assist aging seniors and their family members, Trump has said he would push for a tax credit for family caregivers. Also, he would shift resources to at-home care and end disincentives that lead to care worker shortages, according to his platform.
Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has floated beefing up the child tax credit to $5,000 per child, but the president-elect has not formally adopted that idea.
Boost tariffs and trade
Trump has said that, if elected again, he will impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.
ANALYSIS
You will pay for Donald Trump’s tariffs. Here’s proof
He’s also floated a 100% or 200% tariff on cars made in Mexico or on the products made by companies that move manufacturing from the US to Mexico.
Trump claims that tariffs will boost American manufacturing, create jobs and bring in billions of dollars to help pay for other policy initiatives – like tax cuts.
But it’s unlikely the revenue generated from new tariffs would fully cover his spending proposals. The duties would also likely raise prices on American consumers. Trump, for years, has inaccurately claimed that foreign countries pay the tariffs. They are paid by importers based in the US.
Separately, Trump has said he will renegotiate the USMCA trade deal his own administration struck with Mexico and Canada.
Cut prices
The former president repeatedly blasted the Biden-Harris administration for the surge in prices in recent years. He has promised to reverse course and lower the prices of gas, groceries and other essentials, though he hasn’t provided many details on how he’d accomplish that.
Trump has repeatedly said he will bring down prices by boosting oil and gas production. He’s vowed to allow for more drilling and reduce regulations. But those efforts may have a limited effect on prices at the pump, which in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market.
Trump has also promised to rescind unspent funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, a milestone climate law backed by the Biden administration, as well as to create a new efficiency commission to conduct a financial and performance audit of the federal government. He said in September that tech billionaire Elon Musk has agreed to lead the commission.
Make housing more affordable
The president-elect has not rolled out a formal housing proposal but has talked on the campaign trail about ways he’d help homeowners.
RELATED ARTICLE
Eight takeaways from the 2024 election
Trump has promised to make housing more affordable and to boost supply by getting rid of regulations that increase costs and by opening up some federal land available for large-scale housing construction.
He has also said falling interest rates will send mortgage rates down to 3% or even lower, which will make financing less expensive for homebuyers. (However, presidents don’t control interest rates.)
Trump has also blamed undocumented immigrants for driving up the cost of housing, which he would address through mass deportations and by banning them from getting mortgages.
The platform of the Republican Party also notes that it would “promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers.”
Invest in US businesses
The former president has said that his plans to increase tariffs and cut the corporate tax rate will result in a boom in American manufacturing.
He has said he will impose tariffs on companies that move manufacturing from the US to another country and, in September, specifically threatened John Deere with tariffs if the company doesn’t abandon plans to move some production from the Midwest to Mexico.
The idea is that tariffs will make foreign-made goods more expensive compared with those made in the US. But prices can go up for US manufacturers too if they need to import certain parts. And there will likely be retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries, making it harder for US companies to sell goods abroad. In 2019, Federal Reserve economists found that Trump’s earlier tariffs led to a net decrease in manufacturing employment.
In September, he called his proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% for companies that make products in the US the “centerpiece” of his plan for a manufacturing renaissance.
Make health care more affordable
While health care was a main focus of Trump’s first term – when he unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and issued multiple executive orders and proposals aimed at reducing drug prices – the president-elect is not placing the same emphasis on the issue during this campaign.
He has alternated between saying he would like to try again to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a better program. When pressed at a September debate, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan.”
Vance sought to fill in some of the details in interviews in September. After initially indicating support for separating healthy and sicker Obamacare enrollees into different risk pools, which could threaten the law’s protections for those with preexisting conditions, he later backed off that view. In October’s vice presidential debate, he said he supports federal approval of state reinsurance programs, which have generally lowered Obamacare premiums by providing funding for insurers that enroll many high-cost patients.

 — 
The ripple effect of Donald Trump’s election victory on Tuesday is already being felt in Washington, DC, where some defendants charged in the Capitol riot of January 6, 2021, could soon be pardoned by the incoming president who has promised as much.
One rioter wasted no time in citing Trump’s victory to try and stave off a hearing in his case, claiming he’s “expected” to receive clemency.
“Throughout his campaign, President-elect Trump made multiple clemency promises to the January 6 defendants, particularly to those who were nonviolent participants,” lawyers for Christopher Carnell wrote in a court filing Wednesday. “Mr. Carnell, who was an 18 year old nonviolent entrant into the Capitol on January 6, is expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.”

Carnell was convicted of all seven counts against him, including disorderly conduct in a restricted building.
As of now, his lawyers wrote, Carnell is “awaiting further information from the Office of the President-elect regarding the timing and expected scope of clemency actions relevant to his case.”
District Judge Beryl Howell quickly knocked down the request in an order Wednesday, telling Carnell the hearing would remain scheduled for Friday.
Trump has previously said he would pardon January 6 defendants, saying in July that “if they’re innocent” he “would pardon them.”

When the United States votes for a new president, the outcome reverberates far beyond its borders.
Now, with a second presidential term for Donald Trump in prospect, CNN correspondents analyze what’s at stake on the global stage, looking at Russia, the Middle East, Europe, China, Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula and Africa.
Russia: Uncertainty over Ukraine policy tempers optimism over Trump return
From CNN’s Clare Sebastian in London
When Trump was first elected in 2016, Russian politicians literally popped champagne corks.
Those were simpler times. Russia had been accused of hacking into the Democratic National Committee several months earlier. Trump was busy dismissing those allegations and resolutely refusing to criticize Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin also had serious historical beef with Trump’s rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for what he saw as her role in fomenting protests in Russia in 2011. For Russia it was Trump: good, Clinton: bad.
This time, the fog of an almost three-year-old war has somewhat clouded the picture.
In February, Putin wryly claimed he would prefer Joe Biden to win because he was more “predictable.” There may have been more than just trolling here. Despite Trump’s toughening rhetoric towards Ukraine, and his running mate’s JD Vance’s open opposition to sending more US military aid to Kyiv as it battles Russia’s invasion, it’s not yet clear if Trump would, or could, cut the purse strings for Ukraine.

“Trump has one useful quality for us: as a businessman through and through he is dead against spending money on various hangers-on and lackeys, on dumb little allies, bad charitable projects and gluttonous international organizations,” wrote former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, now a senior security official, on his Telegram channel Wednesday, adding that Ukraine is “one of those.”
“The question is, how much will they force Trump to give to the war. He is stubborn, but the system is stronger,” he said, a clear reference to the vital role the US Congress plays in funding Ukraine. Down-ballot races also matter in Moscow.
In the early hours of Wednesday morning, Margarita Simonyan, the editor-in-chief of RT and now top Kremlin propagandist, wrote simply: “Trump won. Go to sleep, team.” Eight years ago, she was posting about driving through Moscow with an American flag in her car window.
The Kremlin also kept it professional, with spokesman Dmitry Peskov noting only that Trump had “expressed his peaceful intentions on the international stage and his desire to end the ongoing policies of extending old wars,” but that in terms of next steps, “we will see after January,” when he takes office.
“They want to show that they are strong enough not to pay attention to who won the White House,” Boris Bondarev, a former Russian diplomat who left his job two years ago in protest over the war in Ukraine, told CNN. He also believes Russia is also betting on “US turmoil” under Trump, hoping internal divisions will “distract” Trump from foreign policy.
Middle East: Israel welcomes Trump return but elsewhere there’s trepidation
From CNN’s chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance in Jerusalem
Just minutes after Trump had himself declared victory, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued gushing congratulations, calling the US election result “history’s greatest comeback.”
RELATED ARTICLE
Here’s what’s at stake in the Middle East under Trump’s second term
“Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,” Netanyahu said on X.
Ahead of the vote, opinion polls indicated Israelis overwhelmingly favored another Trump presidency.
The Biden administration – including Vice President Kamala Harris – is seen here as having sought to restrain Israel’s tough military response in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran in the aftermath of the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel in October last year.
Trump’s presidency, on the other hand, is remembered for a series of pro-Israel moves, like relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and taking a tough stance on Iran.

From a second Trump term in the White House, Israel may be hoping for even more full-throated US support for its military plans.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, Trump’s election victory has been greeted with trepidation.
A spokesman for the Iranian state said a Trump presidency will make “no significant difference” to them. But amid a spiraling confrontation with Israel, which said it had carried out unprecedented airstrikes on Iranian missile production facilities and air defenses last month, the possibility of even firmer US support for Israel is likely to be a major concern for Tehran.
Hamas, the Iran-backed Palestinian militant group still holding a large number of Israeli citizens hostage in Gaza, has called for an immediate end to America’s “blind support for Israel and its fascist government.”
Europe: Wary leaders face prospect of higher security costs and NATO funding questions
From CNN’s international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson
In Ukraine, where the rubber meets the road in the coming friction between Europe and President-elect Trump, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock tried to strike a conciliatory tone, saying: “Germany will also be a close and reliable ally for the future American government. That is our offer.”
But like all the statements of support coming from European leaders early Wednesday, the offer belies deep concerns that Trump doesn’t care what his allies think.
On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to end the war in Ukraine “in a day,” raising fears among NATO allies he’ll reward Putin’s illegal invasion and rampant aggression with territorial gains that will whet the Russian dictator’s appetite for further military conquests, potentially inside NATO’s borders.
The European pitch to Trump not to throw Ukraine under Putin’s nationalist drive to steamroller former Soviet states into submission is undoubtedly going to be heated. As Baerbock says: “As in any good partnership: where there are unquestionable political differences, an honest and, above all, intensive exchange is more important than ever.”
That exchange, in part, will likely focus around Trump’s not unreasonable fixation that Europe should pay for its own security, rather than expect the United States to bail it out.
There will undoubtedly be reminders that of the $190 billion in economic and military aid the European Union and United Kingdom give to Ukraine, $29 billion is spent on buying American weapons for the Ukrainians. In short, the US gains too.

The new NATO Secretary General, former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, appears to be taking a leaf from his predecessor Jens Stoltenberg’s book on managing Trump, playing to his ego as he congratulated the soon-to-be-leader of the most powerful partner in the now 32-nation alliance by saying “his leadership will again be key to keeping our alliance stronger.”
Careful supplication might help keep the alliance alive; it worked for Stoltenberg. But Zelensky’s chances of keeping Ukraine whole and not losing any territory in a Trump-hastened deal with Putin to end the war may be receding, leaving him clutching at straws.
Zelensky, like the others playing to Trump’s vanity through praise, said: “I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs. This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.”
Baerbock, whose own government is at risk of breaking apart under huge economic pressure, is already pragmatic about the political, diplomatic, and economic uncertainties a Trump victory brings, saying: “Europeans will now have to assume even more responsibility for security policy.”
China: Fears over unpredictability of another Trump term
From CNN’s Steven Jiang in Beijing
In 2020, Chinese leader Xi Jinping didn’t congratulate Biden until more than two weeks after the Democratic candidate was projected the winner of the US presidential election. Xi likely won’t wait that long this time around – and many of his underlings had been mentally prepared for a Trump victory for months as they watched the race with a mixture of bewilderment and growing anxiety.
Publicly, throughout the campaign, Chinese officials and state media had been flooding the public with a narrative of Washington’s “bipartisan consensus” to contain and suppress China’s rise – in other words, “both candidates are equally bad.” In a country known for its ever-tighter media control, this messaging sinks deep in many people’s minds – weighed down by a sluggish economy – along with a picture painted for them highlighting political polarization and violence in the US, in stark contrast to that of unity and stability under Xi’s iron grip.

For those whose life or work is more intertwined with the US, though, a second Trump term appears to be a lot more unsettling. One of the oft-heard talking points from Beijing is that Trump’s “America First” approach benefits China strategically – on issues ranging from Taiwan to the South China Sea – compared to a united front with US allies and partners targeting China advocated by Biden and Harris.
However, Trump’s trademark unpredictability is the one trait that kept many Chinese officials awake at night and still haunts them, especially in a place where certainty in government and policy is almost a given under one-party rule. Some officials, in private, had been fretting over the prospect of disruption or even total halt to just-resumed US-China talks – and its consequences for both sides and the world – on subjects that include economic and military affairs, fentanyl crackdown and climate change.
Trump’s campaign rhetoric on new tariffs and the dark cloud over immigration have jolted Chinese exporters and students. And his pending White House return has even hit home for China-based foreign journalists, who still remember Trump’s decision to kick out numerous Chinese state media journalists in the US, ushering in a round of tit-for-tat that has now left only two dozen or so American reporters in China to cover this superpower of 1.4 billion people.
Taiwan: Defense and economic concerns dominate
From CNN’s Will Ripley in Taipei
Election observers in Asia view Trump’s apparent win as a source of significant uncertainty and a potential double-edged sword for the self-governing island of Taiwan.
Trump has previously indicated that Taiwan should contribute more financially for US defense support, potentially reshaping the partnership between the two sides, and increasing pressures on the democracy of 23 million.
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory, despite never having controlled it, and has vowed to take the island by force if necessary. Under the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington is legally required to provide the island with the means to defend itself, and it supplies Taipei with defensive weaponry. But the arms sales have drawn angry rebukes from Beijing.
In a statement, Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te congratulated Trump and Vance on their electoral victory, and thanked Biden and Harris for their resolute support for Taiwan during their term. Lai stressed the importance of Taiwan’s friendship with the US and said Taipei would “continue to cooperate closely with the new US government and Congress to create a new chapter in Taiwan-US relations.”
Meanwhile, Taiwan’s main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), which favors warmer ties with Beijing, voiced a hopeful outlook, expressing confidence that Trump’s experience could pave the way for “steadier bilateral relations” and foster closer cooperation between the US and Taiwan.

Aside from defense, economic concerns add another layer of potential tension. Trump has repeatedly accused Taiwan of “stealing” US chip business and has even threatened tariffs on Taiwan’s critical chip exports – used to power an array of modern technologies, from smartphones to satellites.
However, analysts say, far from stealing, Taiwan grew its own semiconductor industry organically through a combination of foresight, hard work and investment.
Taiwan now faces the challenge of navigating Trump’s shifting priorities, balancing both opportunities and uncertainties. Ultimately, the full impact on US-Taiwan relations remains to be seen, and hinge on who will be advising Trump on foreign policy.
Korean Peninsula: Big questions loom for South and North
From CNN’s Mike Valerio in Seoul
Could President-elect Trump reduce the number of American troops on the Korean Peninsula, or ask South Korea to pay more for its US security guarantee, once in office?
Those are the central questions now facing Seoul, as Trump has openly considered downsizing the approximately 28,500 US troops stationed in South Korea.
During an interview last month with the Economic Club of Chicago and Bloomberg News, Trump said if he served a second term, South Korea would pay $10 billion for US troops.
Seoul currently pays $1.13 billion annually for American military forces within its territory, a figure which under an agreement signed Monday is expected to rise to $1.26 billion annually in 2026.
“If I were there (in the White House) now, they’d be paying us $10 billion a year. And you know what? They’d be happy to do it,” Trump said. “It’s a money machine, South Korea.”
South Korea currently hosts the largest US overseas military base, Camp Humphreys, an Army garrison about 60 miles from North Korea. The South Korean government financed 90% of Camp Humphreys’ expansion costs within the past decade.
The American presence on the Korean Peninsula serves as a counterweight to North Korean and Chinese military forces, with joint military drills between the US and South Korea launching frequently from the American installations.
Would the drills cease or be reduced once Trump returns to office? Some of the exercises have also included Japan, after the Biden administration forged a new security partnership between Tokyo, Seoul, and Washington. Will that security pact continue with the same force into the next Trump administration?

Another question looming large in Seoul and Pyongyang: Will Trump seek another high-profile summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un? The cautious answer, according to Trump’s last national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien: “I think we’d resume talks with North Korea.”
But if another summit were to happen, Trump would face an emboldened North Korea. Kim has since forged a new military partnership with Putin, sending munitions and North Korean special forces troops to fight in the Ukraine war.
In exchange, observers note, Putin may help Kim with advanced military technology, and send the isolated nation badly needed cash. North Korea is in desperate need of income after years of crippling sanctions over its nuclear program.
North Korea now has less of a reason to negotiate with Washington, since it’s the beneficiary of diplomatic cover, economic, and military resources from Moscow.
Trump, meanwhile, will likely demand change from both sides of the DMZ.
Africa: Cautious optimism over Trump win
From CNN’s Larry Madowo in Accra, Ghana
Trump has many fans in Africa, despite the declining influence of the US on the continent and widespread anti-Western sentiment. Africa’s population is overwhelmingly Christian or Muslim in faith so Trump’s “family values” positions, especially on abortion and LGBTQ issues, resonate deeply here. Colonial-era anti-homosexuality laws remain in place in large parts of the continent and the American right’s messaging on culture war issues has spread like wildfire on African social media.
Even though Harris travelled to Africa as vice president – visiting Ghana, Tanzania and Zambia – many here believed misinformation that falsely claimed that she had not accepted her Black identity before the campaign and that her Jamaican ancestors owned slaves. That is why some prefer Trump, who reportedly referred to African nations as “shithole countries” in 2018, over Harris who they grumbled was not proud of her African roots and identified as Indian.

The myth of Trump as a successful businessman remains strong in Africa, partly because “The Apprentice” TV show was widely distributed. Many on the continent have also embraced the Republican narrative of a strong US economy during the first Trump presidency. Their hope is that a stronger global economy bodes well for African trade with the rest of the world.
Africans who want an end to what they see as US meddling support Trump, hoping that his “America First” policy means he will leave the continent alone. Many analysts say Africa has fared better under Republican administrations, and view Trump’s win with cautious optimism. One example is the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) which was launched by George W. Bush 21 years ago and has saved many lives.
The Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to counter China’s influence in Africa will likely suffer with Trump’s win. It’s not clear if Biden will still visit Angola early next month to highlight one of those initiatives - the Lobito Corridor.
Latin America: Bracing for Trump
From CNN’s Stefano Pozzebon in Bogotá, Colombia
Trump’s victory holds enormous impact for Latin America.
Conservative leaders such as Argentinian President Javier Milei and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele, as well as Jair Bolsonaro, the former Brazilian president, were among the first to congratulate Trump and will feel emboldened by such a conclusive win.
Progressives like Colombia’s Gustavo Petro and Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum are instead bracing for a bumpy relationship with the new White House.
Mexico will probably bear the brunt of the next four years because, as the US’ largest trading partner, its exports could be hit hard by the protectionist tariffs Trump has promised: on Wednesday morning the Mexican peso tumbled to its weakest level in two years before partially recovering in later trading.
Sheinbaum told reporters Wednesday that “there is no reason for concern” and that the US and Mexico “don’t compete with each other,” but her administration will be pressed to get on good terms with Trump quickly and sign a deal before the new economic policy is drawn.

Much of that deal will rest on migration, with Mexico required to play a more active role in limiting arrivals at the US’ southern border.
Trump’s pledge to forcibly deport millions of undocumented migrants, if enacted, could wreak havoc across the region, where many countries depend on remittances from the US to boost their economies.
That said, restraining migration towards the US will remain a formidable challenge in the next four years, especially if Trump’s plans boost domestic production at the expense of economies in the rest of the Americas.
Lastly, authoritarian regimes such as those in Venezuela and Nicaragua could see the benefit of a more transactional approach to foreign policy, the new White House happy to overlook their anti-democratic abuses as long as migration trends are reverted.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/06/world/trump-election-victory-world-view-intl/index.html
131,Ukraine,2024,11,Russia steps up mass drone attacks in bid to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses,Daria Tarasova-Markina,"Kyiv, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
Russia is unleashing near-constant waves of long-range drone strikes on Ukrainian cities as its troops advance in the east, as President Volodomyr Zelensky warned Moscow was firing about 10 times as many drones as it did last fall.
As well as drastically increasing the number of strikes, Russia has begun to fire decoy drones without warheads to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses. Decoy drones carry a “3D-printed ball wrapped in foil” to imitate the warhead of an Iran-made Shahed-136 drone, Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air defenses, told CNN.
These cheaper drones confuse Ukraine’s air defenses, which may shoot down decoy drones instead of ones carrying a lethal warhead. Decoy drones now account for as many as half of all Russian drones fired at Ukraine, Ihnat said.
The Russian army has been pounding Ukraine throughout the war, but the moves signal a change in Moscow’s tactics following Donald Trump’s reelection as president, who could pull support. Meanwhile, Ukraine is under fierce pressure on the eastern frontlines, where its army chief has warned his forces are facing “one of the most powerful Russian offensives” since the start of the war.
Night after night, residents in Kyiv and across the country have been kept awake by the sound of explosions and the continuous buzzing of drones. Air raid sirens blasted in Kyiv for around 50 hours in September, 80 hours in October and more than 30 hours in the first week of November alone.
In the capital, there has only been one night without a drone attack since September 1.
“Their goal is to break us morally,” Vadym Naustinov, a 32-year-old copywriter living in the center of Kyiv, told CNN on Thursday. He said he has developed a “system” for coping with constant air attacks.
“If I hear drones flying or realize that the explosions are getting closer, I quickly run to the subway,” he said, which have been used throughout the war as a bomb shelter. “If I realize that the explosions are close by, and Shahed is near my house, so I won’t have time to get to the subway, I hide in the corridor or bathroom. I just hide, wait and hope that I will survive.”

Shrapnel from downed Russian drones injured at least two people and damaged several buildings in Kyiv after an attack overnight into Thursday, said Serhiy Popko, head of the city’s military administration. “It was a massive attack,” Popko said, with the attack coming “in waves, from different directions” and at “different altitudes.”
Hours later, Russia launched another air attack on the southern region of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least four people and injuring 18 others, including a four-month-old girl, local officials said. “They enjoy people’s death there,” Zelensky said on Telegram.
Zelensky on Monday said Russia has increased by tenfold its Iranian-made Shahed drone attacks on Ukraine. “This terror is increasing every month,” he said earlier this week.
As Russia steps up its strikes, Ukraine is bracing for the potential withdrawal of support from the United States following Trump’s reelection. Throughout his campaign, the Republican now-president-elect cast strong doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv as the war rages on more than two-and-a-half years after Moscow invaded.
In his September presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say he was committed to Ukraine defeating Russia. Later that month, he suggested that Ukraine should have “given up a little bit” to Moscow.
Zelensky was swift to congratulate Trump on his victory, saying Wednesday that he appreciates the president-elect’s commitment to “peace through strength,” a cornerstone of his foreign policy.

“I recall our great meeting with President Trump back in September, when we discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine,” Zelensky wrote on social media.
Wednesday also marked the third month of Ukraine’s incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, a bold and unexpected cross-border attack that sought to divert Russian troops from Ukraine’s embattled east.
“This is our contribution to ensuring that everyone in the world sees: Ukraine can change the course of this war to make those responsible for the war feel real pressure. True peace is only achieved by those who are truly brave,” Zelensky said Wednesday.
To counter Ukraine’s offensive – which marked the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II – Russian President Vladimir Putin has bolstered his military’s manpower with North Korean forces, in the latest sign of Moscow’s alliance with Pyongyang.
As many as 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, US officials have warned.

132,Ukraine,2024,11,Ukraine is forced to confront a brutal Trump reality that it hoped would never happen,Nick Paton Walsh,"CNN
 — 
Bets were hedged, upsides conjured and insurance policies crafted. But ultimately, most hoped it would not happen.
Ukraine and its NATO allies have had for months to entertain the idea of a Trump victory, juggling conceits of a strongman US president who might be a yet tougher ally, a dealmaker who might bring a favorable peace, or fresh eyes who might see a new end to a fatiguing war.
This was but a comforting fiction: The road ahead for Kyiv is extremely stark. There should be no enduring mystery about what a Trump presidency means for Ukraine. Donald Trump has said he would end the war “in 24 hours,” but not how. He also said that “Zelensky should never have let that war start,” and dubbed him “one of the greatest salesmen I have ever seen” who gets $100 billion on every visit to Congress.
As of this morning, the fact these statements are wild exaggerations ceased to really matter. They became the warped lens through which the president-elect of the United States will perceive the largest conflict in Europe since the Nazis. Trump may appoint a cabinet that mildly adjusts the pace or tone of his instincts, but in the end he wants out. It doesn’t matter that strategically Ukraine’s war has so far provided the Pentagon with a comparatively cheap means of degrading its second greatest adversary at no cost to American life. It is an anathema to two of Trump’s first term dislikes: costly US military engagement abroad, and upsetting Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Kremlin’s initial response – that US-Russia relations could not get any worse than they are now under President Joe Biden – surely belies glee. The year ahead was for Russia, according to most analysis, a careful gamble. Moscow has been positioning forces on the hilltops around Ukraine’s military hubs in the Donbas – near Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, Chasiv Yar – to enable this winter the punishing squeeze of Kyiv out of the Donetsk region.
Success in Donetsk could leave the path to major cities like Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia wide open, making the Ukrainian capital suddenly very vulnerable, and likely tipping the scales of the war. Yet the clock has been ticking on Russia’s efforts. Western officials have suggested that its casualty rate – of perhaps 1,200 dead or injured a day – is unsustainable without another major, unpopular Russian mobilization, and that next year Moscow could see a genuine crunch in armor production and ammunition.
Putin played these recent cards hoping Trump would win, on the sure bet he would remain a man of instinct – isolationist and distrustful of America’s long-term alliances.

Trump is erratic and unpredictable, especially with complex and time-consuming matters like foreign conflicts. He prefers the fast fix of just leaving Afghanistan to the Taliban, or a Singapore face-to-face with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, or a drone strike on Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qasem Soleimani. We may never learn if he really studied the direction he imposes on Ukraine, or if he just never again wants to talk about the war, or spend money on it.
Whatever the speed or detail of the Trump approach, the damage will still be palpable in the weeks ahead. I recall in December of last year the massive blow to morale among Ukrainian troops when Congress stalled US military aid for around six months. Frontline troops told me they would have to flee their positions without that help, even if they knew the Biden administration still wanted – in principle – to have their back. Now they must deal with the tables turned: the possibility that some aid still drips through from the Pentagon and European NATO allies, but that the Trump administration has instead taken a hostile posture at Kyiv’s spine.
Furthermore, Trump enters the White House at perhaps the most perilous time for Kyiv since the start of the war. Several analyses of the front line show Ukraine has lost ground at an almost unparalleled pace in October; losing small villages that are inconsequential by themselves, yet in the round amount to a strategic setback that leaves the east acutely vulnerable.

There has long been a policy flaw in NATO’s approach; the Biden administration did not want to arm Ukraine forcefully enough that Russia might be militarily defeated, as it feared wider escalation. But Biden also could also not countenance letting Russia prevail. Instead the alliance sked Ukraine to endure, in the hope eventually Putin would crumble. It was the messy contradiction at the heart of the support for Kyiv, yet better than asking Ukraine to surrender.
Without the will to fight – the belief that the battle is winnable – it is near impossible to ask Ukrainians to sit under shellfire in a trench, or drive their armor at the deadly fire of enemy positions. Nobody wants to be the last soldier to die in a war; nobody wants to lose their life fighting to protect a family who will likely live under Russian occupation anyway.
Trump’s victory may also complicate the very position of Zelensky. For years Zelensky has – to paraphrase Trump – been foremost an outstanding salesman of Ukraine’s cause. Now he is weighed down with immense baggage from Trump’s first term when he was emboiled in Trump’s requests to investigate the Biden family. Can Zelensky still be that salesman? Is a fresh face in Bankova more likely to garner military aid, or strike a viable peace deal?
Those tired of the Ukraine war – be they Kyiv ally or frontline soldier – should still not embrace the idea of a Trump-backed deal. Moscow has proven, in Syria in 2013 and Ukraine in 2015, that it negotiates to buy time to prepare for, or fulfill, its military goals. Putin will accept whatever territorial gains he can concretize – he already has the gains at the negotiating table. But he will then regroup, and not stop. He has sold the war domestically as Russia facing the massed ranks of the entire NATO alliance. An overheated Russian economy, astronomical death toll and retooling of Russia’s industrial base, all in service of that supposed fight, cannot simply be undone. Putin is increasingly needy of the war to retain his grip on power.

This is apparent in his maximalist behavior towards Russia’s neighbours in the last month. The recent turmoil in Georgia and Moldova, where pro-Russian forces have challenged pro-European movements with limited success, may see yet greater intervention from Russia in the months ahead. Putin is unlikely to suddenly abandon his hunger for greater regional influence. Remember his original motivation: This war began because he wanted to occupy Ukraine, and keep it out of NATO and the European Union. The Russian blood expended over nearly three years likely demands a greater victory than simply keeping the territorial gains it already has.
One vital lesson of the war will meanwhile face a grave assault. For the past two years, Putin’s fiercest opponents have pushed the key idea that we need no longer fear Russia; that the Kremlin fanned the fear of its hulking Bear as a psychological weapon to make up for its military decrepitude. Ukraine’s unexpected resistance showed that fear was misplaced, and that Moscow had struggled to defeat a neighbor it once scorned as unable to fight.
Now a Trump White House may ask the world to quickly swallow an apparently similar contention that is terrifyingly different: that the West should not be afraid of Russia as it does not really mean much harm. That would be Putin’s greatest victory, and the West’s sorest weakness.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/07/europe/analysis-ukraine-trump-election-intl-latam/index.html
133,Ukraine,2024,10,"Small number of North Korean troops are already inside Ukraine, officials say",Natasha Bertrand,"CNN
 — 
A small number of North Korean troops are already inside Ukraine, according to two western intelligence officials, and officials expect that number to grow as the North Koreans complete training in eastern Russia and move toward the front lines of the war.
The North Korean troops’ presence inside Ukraine goes a step beyond what NATO and the Pentagon confirmed on Monday, which is that roughly 10,000 North Korean troops are training in eastern Russia with some en route to Russia’s Kursk region. Ukrainian troops have held territory inside Kursk since August.
“It seems that a good many of them are already in action,” one of the officials said on Tuesday, referring to the North Koreans. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that Ukrainian intelligence assessed that the troops would start to enter combat zones on Sunday.
A US official said the US can not yet corroborate reports that North Koreans troops are already inside Ukraine. The US has been playing catchup, however, when it comes to North Korea’s deployments — US officials did not confirm publicly that the troops were in Russia until weeks after South Korea first alleged it.
US and South Korean diplomatic and military officials are meeting in Washington, DC this week to discuss the deployment and North Korea’s “expanding relationship with Russia” more broadly, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday.
Separately, top Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak is in the US capital Tuesday for meetings with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Yermak said he and Sullivan discussed the “North Korean soldiers whom Russia is preparing for war.”
South Korean officials also traveled to NATO headquarters on Monday and briefed allies on the North Korean deployments. NATO allies have been hoping that the intelligence spurs South Korea to begin providing military aid to the Ukrainians, which would be at odds with the South Koreans’ longstanding policy of not arming countries at war. But South Korea’s president has signaled an openness to changing that policy.
“While we have maintained our principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, we can also review our stance more flexibly, depending on the level of North Korean military activities,” South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said last week.
It is still unclear how helpful the North Koreans will be to the Russians on the battlefield. Many of the troops deployed are special forces, the sources said, and intelligence assessments suggest that the North Korean government believes their troops have more combat power than regular Russian troops because they are better trained and specialized, officials said.
But North Korea’s military has not fought in an actual war for over 70 years, and intelligence officials believe the North Korean government sent them in large part so they could gain combat experience.
Officials also expect that at least some of the troops will desert their units once they get to the battlefield, and that the language barrier with the Russians will be a significant impediment to conducting seamless operations. The Russians have been teaching North Korean soldiers basic Russian commands in training, like “fire” and “in position,” South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Tuesday.
Some Russian troops are already raising concerns about how the North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit and have wondered “what the f**k to do with them,” according to audio intercepted by Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence on October 23 from encrypted Russian transmission channels.
The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, CNN has reported.
‘The number may rise’
Many of the public assessments that have emerged on North Korea’s troop movements have come to light via South Korean lawmakers speaking to the media after briefings with the country’s intelligence services.
On Wednesday, two lawmakers – Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won – spoke to reporters after a closed door briefing from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Their assessment was that North Korea had sent members of its elite XI Army Corps to Russia, which specialize in urban terrain and infiltration. But the DIA questioned such a unit’s effectiveness in the more open terrain of the Kursk region.
The DIA added that there was not exact information on whether North Korean troops have been sent to fighting positions, but there “is a possibility that an advance team may have been sent to the frontline,” the lawmakers said.
South Korean intelligence has put the number of North Korean troops inside Russia right now at about 13,000, higher than the US and the UK. The number could go up further — the US has already revised its assessment upward from last week, when the White House assessed that only about 3,000 North Korean troops were in Russia.
“The number may rise,” a third western official said. “Allies and partners across the globe are watching and consulting and will proactively share intelligence on the matter as it affects the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions and beyond.”
In addition to military personnel, North Korea has provided Moscow with 11,000 containers of ammunition consisting of around 2 million artillery rounds since last year, a senior NATO official told CNN earlier this month.
The US has also been urging China, which maintains a relationship with Pyongyang, to intervene and pressure the North Koreans to pull back, officials said.
Sullivan “directed the US government to engage the PRC and to organize an effort to get other countries to reach out to the PRC as well over our concerns about DPRK sending troops into Russia and the implications of that,” a US official told CNN, referring to China.
“We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,” Miller said.
Western officials are not optimistic, however, that China will intervene with North Korea’s plans, the sources said. China has continued to be a “critical enabler” of Russia’s war effort, according to the NATO official, and is still fueling Russia’s defense industry with substantial amounts of dual-use goods like microelectronics and machine tools that can be used to build weapons.

134,Ukraine,2024,10,"North Korean soldiers learning Russian commands and may be sent to Ukraine front lines, South Korean lawmakers say",Jessie Yeung,"Seoul, South Korea
CNN
 — 
North Korean soldiers may be being readied for a move to the front lines of Russia’s war against Ukraine after being taught basic Russian commands, South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Tuesday, citing the country’s intelligence officials.
About 10,000 North Korean soldiers are receiving military training in eastern Russia, the Pentagon estimated on Monday – up from a previous estimate of 3,000 by the White House.
South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) is now watching for the possibility of “some North Korean personnel, including high-ranking military officials, moving to the front lines,” said lawmakers Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won, who were briefed by the NIS during a closed-door meeting of a parliamentary intelligence committee.
Russia is teaching North Korean soldiers about 100 basic military words like “fire” and “in position,” the lawmakers said.
However, they added, it’s clear that North Korean soldiers are struggling to communicate – and it’s not clear whether they’ll be able to bridge the language gap.
North Korea has also stepped up its security measures – both to protect its dictator Kim Jong Un and to prevent news of the North Korean deployments to Russia from spreading within the highly isolated, impoverished country.
To this end, North Korean officers involved in the Russian effort are banned from using phones, while families of soldiers are told that their loved ones are simply participating in a “military exercise,” the lawmakers said.

Despite these measures, word has spread within North Korea of deployments to Russia – sparking “unrest” in some parts of the country, the lawmakers said.
Some residents and soldiers have voiced fears of possibly being sent to Russia themselves, while others have questioned why they are being sacrificed for a different country, they added.
Last week, Ukraine intercepted Russian transmission channels and released audio, with Russian soldiers heard talking disdainfully about the incoming North Korean soldiers, calling them the “K Battalion” and referring to them as “the f**king Chinese.”
The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, which the Russian soldiers are heard in the audio condemning.
“The only thing I don’t understand is that there [should be] three senior officers for 30 people. Where do we get them? We’ll have to pull them out,” one Russian serviceman says.
This could mark the first time North Korea makes a significant intervention in an international conflict. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but most of its troops lack combat experience.
The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but at the BRICS summit in Russia last week, President Vladimir Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
North Korea said on Friday that any troop deployment to Russia to aid the war in Ukraine would conform with international law, state media reported, without explicitly confirming such presence. North Korea had previously dismissed such reports.
North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui is now in Russia for her second trip there in six weeks, having departed Pyongyang on Monday. She likely traveled to discuss potentially dispatching more North Korean troops – and what Pyongyang would receive in return, the lawmakers told reporters.

135,Ukraine,2024,10,Russia bombs historic Soviet skyscraper in Ukraine’s Kharkiv,,"Reuters
 — 
A Russian guided bomb attack on Kharkiv on Monday shattered much of the Derzhprom building, one of the most celebrated landmarks in Ukraine’s second city, dating from the 1920s.
Six people were injured in the 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) strike, adding to 13 wounded in an earlier overnight bomb attack on the city.
In the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, a Russian missile struck a three-story residential building, killing one person and wounding at least 11.
President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the strike on Kharkiv’s Derzhprom (State Industry) building, one of the most striking examples of Soviet-era constructivism architecture and dubbed the Soviet Union’s first skyscraper.
Writing on X, he also deplored the attack on Kryvyi Rih, his hometown, and called for renewed efforts to force Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to halt the more than two-and-a-half-year-old war.
“Every handshake with war criminal Putin boosts his confidence. Every pleasant smile convinces him that he can get away with his crimes,” Zelensky wrote.
“Instead of cozying up to him, we must force him into peace through our collective decisiveness.”
Reuters news agency video showed parts of the Derzhprom building reduced to rubble and virtually all of its windows shattered.

“The occupiers have struck an iconic symbol of the city, known to all residents of Kharkiv,” Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, wrote on Telegram. He said several floors had been destroyed.
The Derzhprom building, placed on the “tentative” list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, was completed in 1928 when Kharkiv was the capital of Soviet Ukraine.
The evening attack also hit a medical facility. Earlier strikes damaged an apartment building and storage space.

136,Ukraine,2024,10,NASA chief calls for investigation into report that Musk and Putin have spoken regularly,Shania Shelton,"CNN
 — 
NASA Administrator Bill Nelson on Friday called for an investigation into a Wall Street Journal report that SpaceX founder and Donald Trump ally Elon Musk and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been in “regular contact” since late 2022.
The report, which said the SpaceX founder has discussed “personal topics, business and geopolitical tensions” with the Russian leader, raises national security concerns as SpaceX’s relationships with NASA and the US military may have granted Musk access to sensitive government information and US intelligence.
“I don’t know that that story is true. I think it should be investigated,” Nelson told Semafor’s Burgess Everett. “If the story is true that there have been multiple conversations between Elon Musk and the president of Russia, then I think that would be concerning, particularly for NASA, for the Department of Defense, for some of the intelligence agencies.”
Some US officials have raised counterintelligence concerns in the last year about Musk’s interactions with US adversaries like Russia, but the US intelligence community is wary of looking into those interactions because Musk is an American citizen, an official familiar with the matter told CNN.
Several White House officials told the Journal they weren’t aware of the contact between Musk and Putin, and the paper said knowledge of the discussions “appears to be a closely held secret in government.” The discussions were confirmed to the Journal by several current and former US, European and Russian officials.
In one instance, the newspaper cited a request from Putin to Musk not to activate his Starlink satellite internet service over Taiwan “as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.”
Musk did not respond to the Journal’s requests for comment.
National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Friday that he had seen the reporting but the White House is “not in a position to corroborate” it and deferred questions to Musk. A Pentagon spokesman told the Journal that the Defense Department does not comment on “any individual’s security clearance, review or status, or about personnel security policy matters in the context of reports about any individual’s actions.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the newspaper that Musk and Putin have only had one telephone call in which they discussed “space as well as current and future technologies.”
Musk has played key role in Ukraine conflict
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, Musk’s support for Ukraine — exemplified by SpaceX’s provision of Starlink services — has diminished as his public statements about the conflict have become further aligned with those of Trump, who has said he would negotiate an end to the war quickly. The satellite internet terminals provided by Musk’s company have been a vital source of communication for Ukraine’s military, allowing it to fight and stay connected even as cellular and internet networks have been destroyed.
Dmitri Alperovitch, a Russia and cybersecurity expert, told CNN’s Alex Marquardt Friday on “CNN News Central” that Musk’s Starlink is “essential to Ukraine in particular because they really could not prosecute this war without” its services.
After Musk trumpeted his early support for Ukraine, SpaceX then abruptly asked the Pentagon to pay tens of millions of dollars per month to fund Starlink in Ukraine and take the burden off SpaceX. In response to that reporting, Musk then abruptly announced on Twitter that he had withdrawn the funding request. Around the same time, Musk used a poll on X to suggest a “Ukraine-Russia Peace” plan that included re-doing elections “under UN supervision” in the regions of the country recently annexed illegally by Russia. After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky questioned Musk’s preference in the war, the tech entrepreneur responded that he “still very much support(s) Ukraine” but feared “massive escalation.”
SpaceX had previously limited its Starlink signal to areas controlled by Ukrainian forces, hampering potential advances that would have relied on Starlink communications. SpaceX then enlarged it to the rest of the country, and earlier this year, Ukraine’s Defence Intelligence claimed it has confirmed the use of Starlink satellite communications by Russian forces in occupied areas. Russia appeared to be buying the terminals from third parties; SpaceX said it did not do business of any kind with the Russian government or its military and that its service would not work in Russia. The statement didn’t address whether it would work in occupied Ukraine.
Ukraine’s claim followed revelations in a biography of Musk, written by Walter Isaacson, about the satellite system’s use in the war. According to an excerpt from the book, Musk did not grant a Ukrainian request to turn on his company’s Starlink satellite communications network near the Crimean coast last year to disrupt a Ukrainian sneak attack on the Russian naval fleet.
Musk’s decision, which left Ukrainian officials begging him to turn the satellites back on, was driven by an acute fear that Russia would respond to a Ukrainian attack on Crimea with nuclear weapons, a fear driven home by Musk’s conversations with senior Russian officials, according to Isaacson.
In October 2022, Musk denied a claim by American political scientist Ian Bremmer that he had spoken with Putin about the war and a proposed “peace plan” to end the conflict.
Musk, who is also the CEO of Tesla and owner of X, has emerged as a major financial figure in this year’s presidential election. He plowed nearly $44 million in October into a super PAC working to restore Trump to the White House — pushing the billionaire’s total donations to the group to nearly $119 million — and he appeared with Trump on the campaign trail earlier this month in Butler, Pennsylvania.
Musk also held his own town halls last week in Pennsylvania, where he urged voters to support Trump and promoted several debunked conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. The two have publicly discussed a potential government role for Musk.
In recent days, Musk also offered splashy, $1 million daily sweepstakes for swing-state voters that has drawn scrutiny from the US Justice Department. Despite a warning from the Justice Department that the payments might be illegal, Musk’s super PAC awarded two $1 million prizes to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday.

CNN
 — 
There is growing intelligence that North Korea has been readying itself for a more direct role in Russia’s war in Ukraine, a move that could reverberate far beyond the frontlines of the war raging in Europe.
The United States, Ukraine and South Korea say that North Korean troops were dispatched to Russia for training with the aim of being deployed to Ukraine.
Russia and North Korea have dismissed the reports, although on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
South Korea has hinted that any deployment could cause it to reassess what level of military support it gives Ukraine.
A group of North Korean soldiers has been spotted in Russia’s Kursk region, an area that borders Ukraine and has seen ongoing military operations, Ukraine’s military intelligence service announced Thursday.
Leaked audio intercepts obtained by the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and released on Friday revealed Russian soldiers raising concerns about how North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit, further heightening fears around Pyongyang’s involvement.
In recent months, Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened their anti-US military partnership and the growing alliance has concerned officials in Kyiv and Washington.
Here’s what we know.
Are North Koreans in Ukraine?
On Wednesday, the White House said at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers had arrived in eastern Russia this month and while it remains unclear what they will do, it is a “highly concerning probability” that they will join the fight against Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly warned that North Korean troops are joining Russia’s war, telling a NATO summit last week that “10,000” soldiers and technical personnel were being prepared.
Zelensky said Friday that according to Ukraine’s intelligence, Russia will deploy its first North Korean troops in combat zones on October 27 and 28, adding, “This is a clear step in Russia’s escalation that matters.”

Meanwhile, South Korea’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service (NIS), said last week that North Korea had shipped 1,500 soldiers, including special forces fighters, to Russia for training.
Those reports appeared to be bolstered when North Korean soldiers were filmed receiving uniforms and equipment at a training ground in Russia’s Far East. Another video circulating on social media and geolocated by CNN showed troops arriving at the Sergeevka Training Ground close to Russia’s border with China.

What is Ukrainian intelligence saying?
The Defense Intelligence of Ukraine said Thursday that some North Korean troops, who had received training in Russia’s far east, have made their way to the Kursk region in western Russia, where Ukraine has maintained a foothold since launching a surprise incursion in August.
Russian soldiers have been heard raising concerns about how North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit, leaked intercepts obtained by the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine and released on Friday show.

“The only thing I don’t understand is that there [should be] three senior officers for 30 people. Where do we get them? We’ll have to pull them out,” one Russian serviceman says.
What’s North Korea’s relationship with Russia?
Russia and North Korea, both pariahs in the West, have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s invasion.
In June, the two nations signed a landmark defense pact and pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its grinding war in Ukraine, a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers.

The arms shipments, which include thousands of metric tons of munitions, have helped Russia replenish its dwindling stockpiles in a war where Ukraine’s forces have long been outgunned and outmanned. Meanwhile, cash-strapped North Korea is believed to have received food and other necessities in exchange.
The hermit nation also seeks to advance its space, missile and illegal nuclear programs.
What has the reaction been?
The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously dismissed the allegations that North Korean personnel had been sent to help Russia as “another hoax.” When asked directly by reporters on Monday whether Moscow was sending North Korean troops to fight in Ukraine, Peskov said that North Korea is a “close neighbor” and the two states were “developing relations in all areas.”
“This cooperation is not directed against third countries,” he said.
North Korea called the claims “groundless, stereotyped rumors,” during a UN General Assembly meeting Monday.
But Seoul is not taking this lightly.
On Monday, its Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador and urged an “immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops.”

South Korean First Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Kim Hong-kyun warned the alleged deployment violates UN Security Council resolutions. The National Security Office held an emergency meeting to discuss a possible South Korean response.
Following the meeting, Kim Tae-hyo, the first deputy director of national security, said the government would implement “phased countermeasures” according to the “progress of the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea.”

It is unclear what the measures would be, but a South Korean government official said that they are preparing “diplomatic, economic and military measures.”
As North Korea is in the “preliminary stage of deploying troops to Russia,” South Korea is assessing whether it will proceed to “actual combat participation,” the government official added.
“We are developing scenarios to understand the potential impacts North Korea and Russia’s actions could have on us,” the government official said.
Seoul, one of the world’s largest arms suppliers, has provided humanitarian aid and financial support to Ukraine, while joining Western sanctions against Moscow. But it has has not directly provided lethal weapons to Kyiv due to arms export controls to countries at war.
The stakes are high.
North and South Korea are separated by one of the world’s most militarized borders and remain technically in a state of war. Relations between the two have deteriorated in recent years with an uptick in fiery rhetoric on both sides of the demilitarized zone.
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said Wednesday the US does not believe the North Korean troops have reached Ukraine, but the movements have generated deep concern as a potentially serious escalation. “It will have impacts not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well,” Austin said.
National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said if the troops are deployed to Ukraine, “They’re fair game. They’re fair targets.”
What’s the significance?
Any intervention by North Korea could be a watershed moment. The isolated and heavily sanctioned regime taking a role in a major international conflict on the other side of the world is something it has not done in decades.
The state has one of the largest militaries in the world, with 1.2 million soldiers, but many of its troops lack combat experience.
Analysts say the North Korean regime would have a lot to gain from deploying troops, including giving its forces battlefield experience and technical training. The arrangement could also help North Korea gain real-world intelligence on the functioning of its weaponry.
“The special forces troops will come back with live battlefield experience, live infiltration experience against an alerted combat opponent. That makes them more dangerous,” said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Command’s Joint Intelligence Center.

“I think Kim is providing the troops to gain the resources he needs to sustain the regime, and lessons learned that he might apply if he thinks the conflict is coming in the peninsula,” he added.
Chun In-bum, a former lieutenant general in the South Korean army, told CNN that the Russians would “get a boost in manpower, which they lack right now” and the North Koreans will get “money, technology” and experience.
Those deployed would be special “elite” forces rather than conventional troops, analysts say.
“If they succeed there, they will get not only firsthand battle experience, but international recognition. So, this could be a real serious problem for the entire world,” Chun said.
“What if the North Koreans make this a habit? What if they become a base for supplying well-trained soldiers? The potential of this deployment should be very concerning.”

CNN
 — 
The thousands of North Korean troops US intelligence says arrived in Russia for training this month have sparked concern they will be deployed to bolster Moscow’s battlefront in Ukraine.
They’ve also turned up alarm from the United States and its allies that growing coordination between anti-West countries is creating a much broader, urgent security threat – one where partnerships of convenience are evolving into more outright military ties.
Hundreds of Iranian drones have also been part of Moscow’s onslaught on Ukraine, and last month the US said Tehran had sent the warring country short-range ballistic missiles as well.
China, meanwhile, has been accused of powering Russia’s war machine with substantial amounts of “dual use” goods like microelectronics and machine tools, which can be used to make weapons. Last week, the US for the first time penalized two Chinese firms for supplying complete weapons systems. All three countries have denied they are providing such support.
Taking stock of the emerging cooperation, a Congress-backed group that evaluates US defense strategy dubbed Russia, China, Iran and North Korea this summer an “axis of growing malign partnerships.”
The fear is that a shared animosity toward the US is increasingly driving these countries to work together – amplifying the threat that any one of them alone poses to Washington or its allies, not just in one region but perhaps in multiple parts of the world at the same time.
“If (North Korea) is a co-belligerent, their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only on in Europe — it will also impact things in the Indo Pacific as well,” US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday in the first US confirmation of North Korean troops in Russia.
‘Driven by survival strategy’
Decades after the Axis powers of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan and the strident anti-West coalition of the Cold War era – and years since George W. Bush’s dubbed US enemies Iran, Iraq and North Korea an “axis of evil” – there’s a perception that a new, dangerous alignment is on the rise, with Putin’s war as its catalyst.
Such an alignment would bring together two long-time nuclear-armed powers, a state believed to have assembled a host of illegal nuclear warheads in North Korea, and Iran, which the US says could likely assembly such a weapon in a matter of weeks.
North Korea’s military partnership with Russia now links the grinding, hot conflict in Europe to an especially tense period in the cold conflict on the Korean Peninsula, as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has elevated his threats toward the South, with which it remains technically at war.
Following the intelligence on the North Korean deployment to Russia, South Korea said it could consider supplying weapons to Ukraine, where the US ally has yet to directly provide arms.
For North Korea, where leader Kim has called to ramp up his country’s illicit nuclear weapons program, there’s been little to lose in sending what’s believed to be millions of rounds of artillery, short-range ballistic missiles and, more recently, troops to Russia.
In exchange, cash-strapped and internationally isolated Pyongyang has likely received food and other necessities – and potentially support developing its space capacities, which could also help its sanctioned missile program.
The importance of drone warfare in Ukraine has also seen Russia look to Iran for procurement – deepening a security alignment that dates to 2015 and the war in Syria, when both backed the regime of Bashar al-Assad.
And for Tehran – weighted by hefty Western sanctions and embroiled in the expanding Middle Eastern conflict with US-backed Israel – supplying Russia weapons is thought to potentially boost its defense sector, while its ties with Beijing and Moscow provide it with diplomatic cover.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping, who declared a “no limits” partnership with Putin weeks before his invasion, has claimed neutrality in the conflict and has largely steered Chinese firms away from supplying direct lethal aid.
Yet it has filled wide gaps in Russian demand of other goods, including products deemed by the US and others to be dual use, and benefited from Russia’s discounted energy. Beijing defends its “normal trade” with Russia. China has also continued to expand joint military drills and diplomatic ties with a country it sees a key partner in pushing back against the West in international fora.
But even as these four countries have their own motivations to cooperate with one another individually, especially within the context of Russia’s war, clear limits exist in any broader coordination, mutual trust, and even interest in working together – at least for now, observers say.
“This is a set of bilateral relationships driven by each country’s survival strategy, or what’s on the menu for geopolitics and what’s the crisis of the day or the decade that they are dealing with,” said Alex Gabuev, director of the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin.
“These are authoritative regimes … and they all see the US as a common adversary. That’s the glue that keeps them together, but whether we can talk about a degree of coordination (between all four) … I think we are very far from that,” he said.
That makes the pressing question whether these current alignments can endure beyond the war in Ukraine and evolve into outright coordination between all four nations.

The China factor
A key factor in how any further alignment develops is China, observers say – by far the most powerful player in the grouping, the lead trade partner for Russia, North Korea and Iran, and the nation viewed by the US as its primary adversary.
As its divisions with Washington have deepened, Beijing has ramped up efforts to challenge US global leadership and shape an international order into one that favors China and other autocracies.
Russia’s role in that effort was on show this week in its southwestern city of Kazan, where Xi and Putin hailed their commitment to building a “fairer” world on the sidelines of a summit of the BRICS group whose membership they’d jointly worked to grow this year.
The two have brought Iran into that diplomatic fold and also largely sided with Tehran in the conflict in the Middle East, where its proxies are fighting Israel. China, Russia and Iran have also held four joint naval drills since 2019, and China is by far Iran’s largest energy buyer.
At the same time, heavily sanctioned Iran is no longer the “favorite state for China’s Middle East policy” as Beijing builds relations with wealthier Gulf countries, according to Jean-Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore’s Middle East Institute.
Beijing also carefully manages its relationship with North Korea – which is almost wholly economically and diplomatically dependent on China. Chinese leaders are widely seen as being wary of the burgeoning Kim-Putin alignment and the potential for an empowered North Korea to cause trouble and draw more US focus to the region.
When asked about the movement of North Korean troops into Russia at a regular press briefing Thursday, China’s foreign ministry said it “does not have information on that.”
While it practices its own aggressive behavior in the South China Sea and toward Taiwan, the democratic island Beijing claims, China may not want to appear to lean too hard into these partnerships and hinder efforts to portray itself as a responsible, global leader.
“Russia, North Korea, Iran is the type of grouping that China least wants to openly associate itself with,” said Tong Zhao, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
China has been “desperate to clarify that it is not a trilateral alliance with Russia and North Korea,” and it also “has more options than these countries … and prefers working with larger number of countries” to compete with the West, he said.

‘A real risk’
Viewed from the West, however, China’s refusal to cut off economic lifelines to a UN sanctions-defiant North Korea and a Russia that has threatened the use of nuclear weapons in Ukraine is often seen as an open endorsement of these regimes.
In July, the Commission on the National Defense Strategy, an independent group tasked by Congress with evaluating US defense strategy, said China and Russia’s partnership had “deepened and broadened” to include a military and economic partnership with Iran and North Korea.
“This new alignment of nations opposed to US interests creates a real risk, if not likelihood, that conflict anywhere could become a multi-theater or global war,” it said.
China has repeatedly insisted that its relationship with Russia is one of “non-alliance, non-confrontation and not targeting any third party.”
NATO has also in recent years moved to ramp up relations with US allies and partners in the Asia-Pacific, with a meeting of defense ministers last week joined for the first time by Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea.
In the short term, Russia’s weapons partnerships also open the door for Iran and North Korea to potentially obtain and produce Moscow’s sensitive weapons technologies and even ship them around the world, according to Carnegie’s Zhao.
The current dynamics also raise the risk that future conflicts – including one where China is at the center and not Russia – see coordination between the four, some analysts assess.
For example, in a potential conflict in the South China Sea or over Taiwan, there is debate over whether Beijing would want to see North Korea or Russia play a role in creating a distraction in North Asia.
But some experts also warn against seeing this “axis” or such a future as a foregone conclusion – as these relationships remain opportunistic, rather than based on deep ideological alignment or trust.
For one, it’s possible that “some more moderate behavior” could be incentivized on the part of China, which could dial down this potential, according to Sydney Seiler, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
But as the optics stand today – “the risk is sufficiently present” that the US could face a future conflagration involves multiple of these countries, he said.

 — 
A group of North Korean soldiers have been spotted in Russia’s Kursk region, an area that borders Ukraine and has seen ongoing military operations, Ukraine’s military intelligence service announced Thursday.
In a post on its official Telegram account, the Defense Intelligence of Ukraine said some North Korean troops, who had received training in Russia’s far east, have made their way to the western Russia region, where Ukraine has maintained a foothold since launching an incursion in August.
The intelligence service said the troops had been seen in Kursk on Wednesday. It added that the roughly 12,000 North Korean soldiers that have been deployed to Russia are receiving training at five military training grounds in the country’s east.
The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but on Thursday at the BRICS summit, Russian President Vladimir Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country.
Last week, CNN geolocated social media videos showing troops arriving at the Sergeevka training ground, close to Russia’s border with China.

Are North Koreans fighting in Ukraine? Here’s what we know
Thursday’s 12,000 figure is larger than had been previously been flagged by US officials. On Wednesday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers arrived in eastern Russia this month.
Ukrainian intelligence services said Thursday that “several weeks” have been allocated for the coordination of the North Korean troops which includes 500 officers and three generals.
Ukraine had repeatedly warned that warming relations between Russia and North Korea could see Pyongyang take a more direct role in the war in Ukraine.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said Tuesday that Kyiv had intelligence about Russia “training two military units from North Korea” involving perhaps “two brigades of 6,000 people each.” He added that Ukraine has seen North Korean “officers and technical staff in the temporarily occupied territories” and believes Russia is “preparing a grouping” to enter Ukraine.
The issue has raised alarm bells among Ukraine’s allies. Lithuanian Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called it a “major escalation in the war” during a Thursday interview with CNN’s Isa Soares. “It’s no longer regional, it’s no longer just European – it is a global conflict, and it affects everybody,” Landsbergis said.
Moscow ‘in contact’ with Pyongyang
Russia’s president did not deny the presence of the North Korean troops when pressed on the issue on Thursday.
When asked by journalists about reports that North Korea was sending troops to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, Putin said his country is “in contact” with Pyongyang.
“We have never doubted that the North Korean leadership takes our agreements seriously,” he told a press conference in Kazan, Russia. “But what and how we will do is our business.”
Russia and North Korea, both pariahs in the West, have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
In June, the two nations signed a landmark defense pact and pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
North Korea has also faced multiple accusations of providing arms to Russia for use in its war in Ukraine – a charge both countries have denied, despite significant evidence of such transfers.
The arms shipments, which include thousands of metric tons of munitions, have helped Russia replenish its dwindling stockpiles in a war where Ukraine’s forces have long been outgunned and outmanned.

141,Ukraine,2024,10,"US and G7 allies moving forward with $50 billion loan package to Ukraine, including $20 billion from the US backed by frozen Russian assets",Sam Fossum,"CNN
 — 
The US and Western allies are moving forward with a $50 billion loan package to Ukraine backed by the profits of frozen Russian assets, which includes a US contribution of $20 billion, the White House announced Wednesday.
“As part of the G7 package, the United States is announcing today that we will provide $20 billion in loans to Ukraine that will be paid back by the interest earned from immobilized Russian sovereign assets,” President Joe Biden said in a statement formally announcing the package. “In other words, Ukraine can receive the assistance it needs now, without burdening taxpayers.”
The president described the loans as supporting Ukrainians “as they defend and rebuild their country.”
“And our efforts make it clear,” Biden added, “tyrants will be responsible for the damages they cause.”
Biden administration officials view the aid as vital for Kyiv’s war-torn economy heading into the winter months.
“Ukraine will receive the assistance it needs now, without burdening our taxpayers,” said White House deputy national security advisor for international economics Daleep Singh.
The announcement comes during a fraught political period in the US, which is less than two weeks away from a presidential election that could return Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has been a public skeptic of US aid to Ukraine, to the White House.
The US will disperse at least half of its $20 billion loan by this December, according to Singh. The administration plans to use half of the loan for economic assistance and the second half for additional military aid to Kyiv. But the White House will need to secure further authority from Congress to provide parts of the loan as military support.
If the White House cannot reach an agreement with the legislative branch securing the requisite authorities, Singh said that the administration would pivot and instead provide the full loan amount as economic aid.
“We’re going to provide $20 billion either way. But we’ll work with Congress over the next few months to assess whether we can get sufficient authority through foreign military financing, loan guarantee authorities to provide half of our assistance through military support,” Singh said.
The other $30 billion in aid will come from the European Union and fellow G7 partners, including the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan.
“As we committed in June, the G7 will begin dispersing assistance for the benefit of Ukraine by the end of this year, so that we can meet Ukraine’s urgent needs as we approach the winter while sending an unmistakable signal, the United States and its G7 partners will not fatigue,” Singh said.
The US-led campaign to reach an agreement between the other G7 nations — the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan — was announced at the group’s summit in Puglia, Italy, earlier this year.
In the ensuing months, the US and its allies have ironed out the finer details of executing the complex loan. European lawmakers on Tuesday approved a loan of up roughly $37.7 billion (35 billion euros) for Ukraine backed by the frozen Russian assets.
Further details will be announced following the forthcoming G7 finance ministers meeting, he added.
Western nations froze Russia’s assets in bank accounts located within Europe and the US as part of a massive wave of sanctions enacted after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Hundreds of billions of assets are frozen in Europe, with just a small amount – roughly $3 billion – located in banks in the US.
This originally led European officials to raise concerns they could be on the hook if Ukraine failed to pay back the loan, but negotiators have ultimately structured the deal so all countries participating share the risk.
Should a peace agreement be reached in the conflict, either the Russian assets will stay frozen and generate interest to repay the loans until they’re repaid, or Russia will pay for the damage it has caused.
G7 countries first started thinking of other long-term sources of funding for Ukraine late last year amid doubts on the future political and financial commitment to continue spending taxpayer money in Ukraine.

 — 
At least 3,000 North Korean soldiers arrived in eastern Russia this month, the White House said Wednesday, and while it remains unclear what exactly they will do, it is a “highly concerning probability” that they will join the fight against Ukraine.
“We assess that between early- to mid-October, North Korea moved at least 3,000 soldiers into eastern Russia,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said. “We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok, Russia. … We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability. After completing training, these soldiers could travel to western Russia and then engage in combat against the Ukrainian military.”
Earlier Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin was the first senior US official to confirm on the record that North Korea had deployed troops to Russia as North Korea and Russia have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
“We are seeing evidence that that there are North Korean troops that have gone to Russia,” Austin told reporters traveling with him in Rome on Wednesday. “What, exactly, they’re doing is left to be seen.”
The US does not believe the North Korean troops have reached Ukraine, but the movements have generated deep concern as a potentially serious escalation in the conflict. Austin said the US is still trying to determine what role the North Koreans will play and whether they intend to travel to Ukraine.
“If they’re a co-belligerent, their intention is to participate in this war on Russia’s behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only on in Europe — It will also impact things in the Indo Pacific as well,” Austin said.
Kirby said Wednesday that the US has briefed the Ukrainian government and are keeping in close consultation with allies and partners.
A senior administration official said earlier Wednesday that the training of North Korean soldiers and possible preparation to send them to find to Ukraine is a sign of serious desperation on Russia’s part.
In Rome, Austin said Putin “may be even in more trouble than most people realize.” Kirby added that turning to North Korea for manpower “would be a sign of weakness, not strength, on the part of the Kremlin.” Kirby also said the move is a violation of UN Security Council Resolutions.
Asked what North Korea will get in return for helping Russia with manpower, Austin said the US is still trying to determine that as well.
In recent months, Moscow and Pyongyang have deepened their anti-United States military partnership and the growing alliance has concerned officials in Kyiv and Washington.
“I can tell you one thing, though,” Kirby said Wednesday. “If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they’re fair game. They’re fair targets.”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly warned that North Korean troops are joining the war on Russia’s behalf, telling a NATO summit last week that “10,000” soldiers and technical personnel were being prepared.
A source in Ukrainian intelligence previously told CNN that a small number of North Koreans have been working with the Russian military, mostly to help with engineering and to exchange information on the use of North Korean ammunition.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s spy agency, the National Intelligence Service, said Friday that North Korea has shipped 1,500 soldiers, including special forces fighters, to Russia for training.

Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged Hong Kong to prevent Russia from using the Asian financial hub to bypass Western sanctions during a visit to the city on Thursday.
The United States and European Union have sanctioned dozens of companies in Hong Kong and mainland China for evading the extensive measures imposed on Russia in response to its invasion of Ukraine, including the supply of critical dual‑use goods such as semiconductors.
Kuleba “called on the Hong Kong administration to take measures to prevent Russia and Russian companies from using Hong Kong to circumvent the restrictive measures imposed for Russia’s aggression against Ukraine,” according to a statement from Ukraine’s Foreign Affairs Ministry issued after the minister met with Hong Kong leader John Lee.
“These restrictive measures are necessary to weaken Russia’s capacity to wage war and kill people in Ukraine,” it added. “The Minister stressed that Russia’s machinations should not spoil Hong Kong’s reputation as a highly developed liberal economy based on unwavering respect for the rule of law.”
Dual-use items are goods, software or technology that can be used for both civilian and military applications. The US has said that some of the dual-use items targeted by its sanctions are critical to Russia’s defense-industrial base.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong government told CNN on Friday that it “implements and strictly enforces” United Nations Security Council (UNSC) sanctions.
While the UN General Assembly has passed resolutions condemning Russia’s invasion and demanding the withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine, similar resolutions at the UNSC have been vetoed by Russia, a permanent member of the group.

Hong Kong officials have previously said the city has no obligation to implement unilateral sanctions imposed by other countries – including when a mega yacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the US, the EU and the United Kingdom dropped anchor in the city in October 2022.
However, international companies based in Hong Kong, including Chinese banks, have generally adhered to US sanctions to avoid any risk of being frozen out of the dollar dominated global financial system.

Kuleba’s visit to Hong Kong was the final leg of his trip to China, the first time the close partner of Russia has hosted a top Ukrainian official since Moscow’s invasion began nearly two and half years ago.
Beijing, which has forged deeper ties with Russia since the invasion and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for Moscow, has repeatedly decried “unilateral sanctions” and what it calls “long-arm jurisdiction” by Western countries, saying they have no basis in international law.
In a meeting in the southern city of Guangzhou on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Ukrainian counterpart that, “although the conditions and timing are not yet ready,” China was “willing to continue to play a constructive role in ceasefire and resumption of peace talks.”
Kuleba told Wang that Ukraine was prepared for peace talks “when Russia is ready to negotiate in good faith,” according to the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry, but stressed that Kyiv saw no such willingness from Moscow.
The Ukrainian diplomat’s visit comes as Beijing faces increasing pressure from the West over its deepening ties to Russia and allegations that it’s aiding Moscow’s war effort by providing dual-use goods. Beijing denies this and says the West is fueling the conflict by supplying arms for Ukraine’s defense.

A Chinese government agency established to promote trade with Russia has been trying to source drone detectors and jammers, adding to concerns that Beijing may be supplying dual-use technology to Moscow.
Foreign companies were seeking “unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipment,” including drone detectors and jammers, according to a procurement notice posted on May 22 on the official WeChat account of the Guangdong Provincial Association for Promotion of Trade with Russia.
The association, overseen by the province’s Commerce Department, said buyers wanted “interference generators, drone detectors (trade names BorisTone, Assel Labs and Bulat) or other similar technology solutions, drone suppressors, and communication band jammers.”

Zelensky says China’s ‘support to Russia’ will extend war in Ukraine during surprise appearance in Asia
Bulat drone detectors were developed by 3MX, a Russian company. They are known for being used by the Russian army during its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
The procurement document has been removed from the association’s WeChat social media account, but it still exists on the account of another government body in the same province.
The Yunfu City’s Association for the Promotion of International Trade posted the same notice on WeChat last week, asking any “interested company” with the products to submit their information.
Drone jammers emit signals at frequencies that drones use to operate and transmit information, overwhelming their ability to communicate.
Ukraine has relied heavily on drones since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion and has piled resources into advancing technology and domestic manufacturing. It has been using them to target Russia’s oil and gas industry, still the biggest source of cash for Moscow’s war effort despite Western sanctions.
The posting of the Chinese notices comes as Beijing faces significant pressure from Western governments to ensure that dual-use products with military applications are not finding their way to Russia’s defense sector or its forces on Ukraine’s battlefield.
The United States has accused Beijing of covertly supporting Moscow’s war by selling such dual-use goods. They include things like semiconductor chips, navigation equipment and jet parts.
Beijing says it is neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and has repeatedly said that it does not provide weapons to either side and “strictly controls” the export of dual-use items.
Notice removed
A person who answered the phone at the Guangdong association denied that the document was intended to secure orders for Russian customers. He told CNN that it was removed because it was “improper.” When asked for further detail, he said that the request was made on behalf of buyers in Kazakhstan, before abruptly ending the call.
CNN has also reached out to the Yunfu trade association for comment.
According to its official WeChat account, the Guangdong association’s main responsibilities include supporting the province’s global trade work, connecting with Russian buyers or sellers, organizing exchanges, coordinating trade settlement with Russia and providing Russia-related legal consultation for Chinese traders.
China has forged deeper ties with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine and become a vital economic and diplomatic lifeline for the country. Last month, Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, both men praising the close relations between their countries.
Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at a meeting of defense chiefs in Singapore that China’s support to Russia would extend the war in Ukraine, adding Ukraine’s voice to concerns raised by the US and European leaders in recent months.
“Beijing does provide a lot of different ways of direct support to Russia’s war in Ukraine, whether it is either the purchase of oil to help fuel its economy or helping them reconstitute the defense industrial base,” said Oriana Skylar Mastro, a fellow at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies.

In Beijing, Xi and Putin left no question of their close alignment in a divided world
Mastro said she is “not particularly surprised” that local Chinese governments would help Russian companies seek drone equipment. But, she doesn’t believe Beijing will have more “direct” involvement in the war.
Last week, the US warned it could act against Chinese firms and financial institutions in response to Beijing’s alleged backing of Russian war efforts.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April that Washington had already imposed sanctions on more than 100 Chinese entities and individuals for allegedly helping support Russia’s war effort.
“Beijing is trying to walk a very thin line between adhering to what the United States is asking them and, specifically, to their foreign policy principle of not selling weapons and equipment and [engaging in] foreign military interference,” said Mastro.
“What they would say is that they are doing their best to prevent the selling of military material to Russia, but things are always [going to] get through,” she said.

145,Ukraine,2024,6,"Fake Tom Cruise documentary is part of a Russian influence campaign aimed at the Paris Olympics, report finds",Sean Lyngaas,"CNN
 — 
Pro-Russian propagandists are ramping up their efforts to denigrate next month’s Paris Summer Olympics and undermine Western support for Ukraine through a series of brazen online and offline stunts, private experts and Western officials told CNN.
The stunts have included using artificial intelligence to impersonate the actor Tom Cruise’s voice narrating a fake documentary attacking the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and placing coffins with an inscription invoking the Ukraine war near the Eiffel Tower, sources said.
The activity appears to be part of an increasingly frantic effort from Russian operatives to tarnish the Olympics and stall any momentum Ukraine is building to use Western-made weapons to attack Russian territory, experts who track Russian disinformation told CNN. The IOC has placed restrictions on Russian athletes’ participation in the Paris Olympics because of Russia’s war on Ukraine.
There is a mix of desperation and opportunism to the recent spate of propaganda, said Gavin Wilde, a former Russia expert at the National Security Council. “For the tech-savvy propagandists working in Russia, the alternative they’re hedging against isn’t irrelevance — it’s a one-way trip to the front lines,” Wilde told CNN.
Russia’s embassy in France called the allegations “Russophobic.”
“The Embassy declares that the Russian Federation has never interfered and does not interfere in the internal affairs of France - our country has other more important priorities,” the embassy said in a statement posted in French. “The Embassy urges the French authorities to put an end to this unfounded and unjustified anti-Russian disinformation campaign.”
Campaign to undermine the West
The Russian operatives used the fake Cruise voice, the Netflix logo and even a fake New York Times review to try to lend the documentary legitimacy, according to analysts at Microsoft, who released a report on the activity on Sunday. The propaganda video, released on social media platform Telegram last year, was “the first glimpse of what would prove to be an extensive campaign” by the same Russian propaganda actor to smear the Paris Olympics, Microsoft said.
Russian propagandists have also been ginning up fake news stories claiming that Parisians are buying property insurance because of fears of terrorism around the Olympics, and fake press releases purporting to come from the CIA and French intelligence warning about terrorism, according to Microsoft.
CNN has requested comment from the Russian Embassy in Washington, DC.
Not all the recent subterfuge has been online.
On Saturday, French police discovered five coffins draped in the French flag, with the words “French soldiers in Ukraine,” near the Eiffel Tower. A French military official told CNN they suspect that Russia was involved in the stunt. French police are questioning three men in connection with the incident.
French President Emmanuel Macron’s refusal to rule out the possibility of sending French troops to Ukraine has infuriated the Russian government.
In recent days, pro-Russia social media accounts have also shared a doctored video of US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller commenting on Ukraine’s potential use of US-made weapons in Russia. The video appears to be compiled from two different press appearances by Miller, showing him wearing different ties.
It’s unclear who made the video. US officials and private experts have not publicly identified the source of the video.
“While this video is obviously fake, it is a step towards what counter-disinformation researchers have been warning about – the use of AI manipulated media to enhance foreign disinformation operations,” the State Department said in a statement to CNN.
The Russian Embassy in South Africa shared a version of the video on its X accounts, according to screenshots captured by a BBC journalist.
Hany Farid, a digital forensic expert and professor at UC Berkley, said the video had hallmarks of being manipulate using AI.
Farid ran the video through multiple deepfake detection systems and said they indicated that the voices in the video had been created using AI and that the lip movements of the State Department spokesperson in the video had been altered using lip-sync AI software.
“Even if the fake is not believed by everyone, the constant bombardment of deepfakes is leading to an overall skepticism of everything we see online,” Farid said.
But Lee Foster, another information operations expert, expressed skepticism that the imagery in the video was made using AI.
“Looking at it from an analytic standpoint, it doesn’t make sense to use AI to manipulate mouth movements such that they are basically identical to the original,” Foster told CNN. “AI manipulation of the video’s audio remains an unresolved question, however.”
Ghosts of Olympics past
Russian antagonism toward the IOC has been years in the making. The IOC has prohibited Russian athletes from competing officially under the Russian flag in Paris because of the Kremlin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Russian athletes have faced similar restrictions at past Olympic games because of Russia’s alleged doping program.
Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency was behind a destructive cyberattack on computers used at the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018, according to the US Justice Department.
Officials at the Paris Olympics are bracing for a similar threat next month.
“The GRU has reserved some its most serious cyberattacks for France and the Olympics, and they carried those out when the geopolitical situation was considerably less strained,” said John Hultquist, chief analyst at the Google-owned cybersecurity firm Mandiant.
The Olympic Games in Paris “will be an incredibly enticing target for these actors,” Hultquist added. “Any attack they cook up will be designed to undermine French prestige and the solidarity at the heart of the event.”

146,Ukraine,2024,5,Ukraine’s Oreo production is back in business after Mondelez repaired its war-damaged factory,,"CNN
 — 
Snack maker Mondelez resumed its production of Oreo cookies in Ukraine, after its plant in a small city in the eastern part of the country was badly damaged during Russia’s invasion roughly two years ago.
Mondelez’s plant in Trostyanets is now fully rebuilt after opening partially last year to make chocolates, according to a company statement.
The company said the Oreo cookies and other chocolates produced at the Ukrainian factory are not being exported to neighboring Russia. Mondelez has three factories in Russia and sells its cookies and snacks there despite boycotts and calls for it to stop from employees, activists and investors.
Mondelez said it was making its business in Russia “stand-alone” with a self-sufficient supply chain by the end of 2023. It appointed new leadership in Europe including Russia earlier this year.
Mondelez’s rivals including Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, continue to sell their products in Russia. Food does not fall under international sanctions.
While the plant in Trostyanets was being repaired, Mondelez imported Oreos to Ukraine, said a source familiar with the company’s plans, who is not permitted to speak to media.
The company said products made in the Trostyanets plant are exported into Eurasian countries such as Georgia and Kazakhstan in addition to being sold in the domestic Ukrainian market.
Plants in Russia previously helped supply those countries, the source said.
“We continue to increase our investments in supporting and rebuilding Ukraine,” the company said in the statement.
Mondelez previously told Reuters there were no more exports from Russia into Europe.
Chocolate wafers with a cream vanilla filling, Oreos are one of Mondelez’s biggest brands, and hit about $4 billion in sales revenue last year, according to a LinkedIn post from CEO Dirk Van de Put. Mondelez’s other top brands include Milka and Cadbury chocolates. It also makes local-brand cookies and crackers.
A little over 30% of Mondelez’s shareholders last week backed a resolution calling for the company to conduct an independent study of the risks of continuing to do business in Russia, according to a company filing.
Norges Bank, Mondelez’s 11th-largest shareholder according to LSEG’s Eikon, backed the proposal, according to the fund’s disclosures. The fund said in the disclosure that when a company “does not meet our needs as a financial investor, we will consider supporting a well-founded shareholder proposal.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/31/business/oreo-ukraine/index.html
147,Ukraine,2024,5,The West is tapping Russian money to arm Ukraine. Much more could follow,Hanna Ziady,"London
CNN
 — 
Money generated by Russian financial assets frozen in Europe will soon start flowing to Ukraine, giving Kyiv a boost as it struggles to counter an advance by Moscow’s troops. Now, the West is trying to turn that trickle of cash into a flood.
Finance officials from the G7 economies met in Stresa, Italy to discuss new ways of using the proceeds from some €260 billion ($282 billion) of Russia’s foreign currency reserves that were frozen by Western countries after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
“Progress has been made … as far as the main issues are concerned,” Italian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said Saturday during a press conference after the meeting, adding that there are some legal technical issues that still have to be resolved.
There is “strong positioning in terms of a political stance by all the G7 countries,” Giorgetti said.
The G7 meeting comes just weeks after Russia mounted a surprise assault in Ukraine’s northern Kharkiv region. As Russia’s attacks intensify, Western leaders are coming under increasing pressure to deliver military aid to Kyiv’s stretched armed forces.
It is “vital and urgent that we collectively find a way forward to unlock the value of Russian sovereign assets immobilized in our jurisdictions for the benefit of Ukraine,” US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during a speech Tuesday in Frankfurt, Germany.
The proposal that reportedly has the broadest backing among US and EU officials involves lending as much as $50 billion to Ukraine, using the future windfall profits from Russian assets held in the European Union as collateral.
The plan “would essentially bring forward that flow of interest proceeds from the assets… (through a loan) given to Ukraine,” Yellen told broadcaster Sky News in an interview this week. “Ukraine has substantial needs, and being able to marshal significant resources to help Ukraine is important,” she said.

G7 finance ministers hope to agree on a way forward that can be signed off when President Joe Biden and other leaders meet for a summit in Italy next month.
The plan stops short of seizing the assets outright. The EU is worried that such a move would discourage other countries from keeping their assets in the bloc. Most of the frozen Russian money is held in Europe, and the euro is the world’s second-most important currency after the US dollar.
The proposal “is a halfway house to full seizure,” Lee Buccheit, a veteran sovereign debt expert and honorary professor at the University of Edinburgh Law School, told CNN.
From $3 billion to $50 billion?
Around two-thirds of Russia’s immobilized assets, or some €210 billion ($228 billion), sits in the EU, mostly at Euroclear, a Belgium-based financial institution that keeps assets safe for banks, exchanges and investors.
Following months of discussions, the EU formally adopted an agreement Tuesday that taps the windfall profits Euroclear makes by reinvesting the cash generated by those assets — such as coupon payments on bonds. Western sanctions mean coupon payments and maturing assets cannot be sent to Russia.

EU leaders endorse plan to tap frozen Russian assets to arm Ukraine
Under the EU agreement, between €2.5 and €3 billion ($2.7-3.3 billion) of these profits will be sent annually to Kyiv. The first payment will be made in July, with 90% earmarked for arms and military equipment.
The split of funds will be reviewed each year starting in January 2025, with the option to shift spending toward rebuilding Ukraine’s war-torn economy as its needs change.
“The EU has chosen a way forward that is legally sound, and flexible so that support can adjust to Ukraine’s most pressing needs,” European Commissioner for Trade Valdis Dombrovskis said in a statement Tuesday.
Unlike the drip feed of funding agreed by the EU, the proposal under discussion by the G7 could deliver a much bigger lump sum, immediately.
Reuters reported Yellen as saying Thursday that a figure of $50 billion had been discussed by G7 ministers but there was no agreement yet on how big the collateralized loan should be.
An even bigger check?
Apart from seizing the stash of assets, or lending Kyiv money backed by the interest they earn, there’s a third option the West might consider — a so-called reparations loan.
Under this approach, Ukraine would borrow money from a syndicate of allies, including G7 members, and pledge as collateral its claim for reparations — or compensation — against Russia. This would give Kyiv access to a much larger amount of money than using future or current windfall profits from Russian assets.
“Ukraine has a claim against Russia for reparations — legally, that is indubitable — and it would in effect be monetizing a portion of that claim by pledging it to secure this loan from the G7,” Buchheit, the debt expert, said.
If Russia failed to pay reparations, then the G7 would be in a position to draw on the pool of frozen assets to recover the value of its loan to Ukraine, he added.
This mechanism also ensures that Russia foots part of the colossal bill for rebuilding Ukraine, which the World Bank has put at $486 billion over the next decade.
“Short of a regime change in Russia, Putin is never going to pay reparations,” said Buccheit. “This $300 billion is probably the only contribution Russia will ever make for paying reparations for what it has done to Ukraine.”

148,Ukraine,2024,8,"Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from occupied Ukraine to counter Kursk offensive, US officials say",Katie Bo Lillis,"CNN
 — 
Russia appears to have diverted several thousand troops from occupied territory inside Ukraine to counter a surprisingly successful Ukrainian offensive inside Russian borders in a move that potentially weakens Moscow’s war effort, two senior US officials told CNN.
The development has drawn American attention and US officials are now working to determine precisely how many troops Russia is moving, but sources said multiple brigade-sized elements made up of at least 1,000 troops each appeared to have shifted to the Kursk region, where Ukraine launched an operation last week.
“It is apparent to us that Mr. Putin and the Russian military are diverting some resources, some units, towards the Kursk Oblast to ostensibly counter what the Ukrainians are doing,” National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby told CNN on Thursday.
The Russian troop movements away from Ukraine “doesn’t mean that Mr. Putin has given up military operations in the northeast part of Ukraine or even down towards the south, towards places like Zaporizhya,” Kirby said. “There’s still active fighting along that front.”
But the movements have raised the tantalizing possibility that what originally appeared to be a quixotic bid by Ukraine to humiliate Russian President Vladimir Putin could have a more significant strategic impact on the battlefield, depending on how long Ukraine is able to hold the Russian territory.
The Ukrainian operation has impressed American officials, particularly the way the Ukrainian military was able to keep its details so secret—the incursion even caught US officials by surprise, officials said.
While the operation has risked softening some of Ukraine’s own defenses along the 600-mile frontline, it may also divert Russian troops who have been making some incremental gains inside Ukraine through the summer, sources added. Ukraine says it has captured over 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles) of Russian territory since the start of its surprise assault, forcing tens of thousands of Russians from their homes.
A senior US official and a senior European intelligence official both said a major goal of the operation appears to be to create “strategic dilemmas” for Putin, particularly when it comes to where Russia should allocate manpower.
Still, Russia is believed to have hundreds of thousands of troops on the frontline in Ukraine, so diverting a few thousand may not have a large impact in the short term, officials said.
Russia also does not appear to be moving its larger and better-trained units away from Ukraine and into Kursk just yet, said two other sources familiar with western intelligence. One of those sources said Russia appears to instead be bolstering Kursk’s defenses primarily with untrained conscripts taken from elsewhere in Russia.
“We haven’t seen a substantial move [of Russian troops] just yet, and we can’t tell whether that’s just because they’re only just getting started moving forces, or whether they just don’t have the forces to move,” said one of the sources familiar with US intelligence.
In addition to the troops moved from inside Ukraine, Russia has also sent personnel from the Leningrad military district and Kaliningrad, in Russia, to help defend Kursk, one of the senior US officials said.
Even as they acknowledged the limited success of the Kursk operation thus far, multiple US and western officials familiar with the latest intelligence cautioned that Ukraine is extremely unlikely to be able to hold the territory for long and emphasized that it’s too soon to judge how the operation will affect the broader outcome of the war.
The US also remains reluctant to allow Ukraine to use long-range, US-provided weapons inside Kursk, multiple officials said—not because of the risk of escalation, but because the US only has a limited supply of the long-range missiles, known as ATACMS, to provide to Ukraine and thinks they would be better used to continue targeting Russian-occupied Crimea, officials said.
Some officials also raised concerns that Ukraine, which one western official said has sent some of its more experienced forces into Kursk, may have created weaknesses along its own frontlines that Russia may be able to exploit to gain more ground inside Ukraine.
“It’s impressive from a military point of view,” the official said of the Kursk operation. But Ukraine is “committing pretty experienced troops to this and they can’t afford to lose those troops.”
“And having diverted them from the front line creates opportunities for Russia to seize advantage and break through,” this person added.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/russia-has-diverted-several-thousand-troops-from-occupied-ukraine-to-counter-kursk-offensive-us-officials-say/index.html
149,Ukraine,2024,7,"Trump says he had ‘a very good phone call’ with Zelensky, discussed Russia-Ukraine war",Kristen Holmes,"CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump said he “had a very good phone call” with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday.
The call between the two leaders, who have had a complicated relationship, marks their first conversation since Trump left the White House and comes the day after he formally accepted the Republican Party’s nomination for president. It also comes amid concerns in Europe about what Trump’s policy toward the Russia-Ukraine war would be if he were to win the presidential election in November.
“President Zelenskyy of Ukraine and I had a very good phone call earlier today. He congratulated me on a very successful Republican National Convention and becoming the Republican nominee for President of the United States,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “He condemned the heinous assassination attempt last Saturday and remarked about the American people coming together in the spirit of Unity during these times.”
Trump continued, “I appreciate President Zelenskyy for reaching out because I, as your next President of the United States, will bring peace to the world and end the war that has cost so many lives and devastated countless innocent families. Both sides will be able to come together and negotiate a deal that ends the violence and paves a path forward to prosperity.”
In a post on X describing the call, Zelensky said he congratulated Trump on his nomination and condemned the “shocking assassination attempt in Pennsylvania.”
“I wished him strength and absolute safety in the future,” he said. “I noted the vital bipartisan and bicameral American support for protecting our nation’s freedom and independence.”
Zelensky concluded, “We agreed with President Trump to discuss at a personal meeting what steps can make peace fair and truly lasting.”
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the Ukraine war in a day, but it remains unclear how he would pursue peace.
In last month’s CNN presidential debate, Trump said that Putin’s terms for an agreement – which would include Ukraine ceding the four territories currently occupied by Russia – are “not acceptable.” But the former president and his allies have also criticized sending US military aid to Kyiv.
But the former president and his allies have also criticized US military aid to Kyiv.
Trump has long been critical of NATO defense spending. In February, the former president said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that doesn’t meet spending guidelines on defense, alarming many leaders in Washington and Europe.
Trump and Zelensky also have their own history. Nearly five years ago, Trump repeatedly pushed for Zelensky to investigate his political rival Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, on a call ahead of the 2020 election. That “perfect phone call,” in Trump’s words, led to his first impeachment.
European diplomats have been preparing for Trump’s potential return to the White House, CNN previously reported, working to set up guard rails for NATO and trying to ensure lasting support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.
Last week, when Zelensky was in the US, he said that “everyone is waiting for November,” including Putin. He also said that Biden and Trump are “very different” but both support democracy, which is why he claimed: “I think Putin will hate both of them.”

150,Ukraine,2024,7,Exclusive: US and Germany foiled Russian plot to assassinate CEO of arms manufacturer sending weapons to Ukraine,Katie Bo Lillis,"CNN
 — 
US intelligence discovered earlier this year that the Russian government planned to assassinate the chief executive of a powerful German arms manufacturer that has been producing artillery shells and military vehicles for Ukraine, according to five US and western officials familiar with the episode.
The plot was one of a series of Russian plans to assassinate defense industry executives across Europe who were supporting Ukraine’s war effort, these sources said. The plan to kill Armin Papperger, a white-haired goliath who has led the German manufacturing charge in support of Kyiv, was the most mature.
When the Americans learned of the effort, they informed Germany, whose security services were then able to protect Papperger and foil the plot. A high-level German government official confirmed that Berlin was warned about the plot by the US.
For more than six months, Russia has been carrying out a sabotage campaign across Europe, largely by proxy. It has recruited local amateurs for everything from arson attacks on warehouses linked to arms for Ukraine to petty acts of vandalism — all designed to stymie the flow of weapons from the West to Ukraine and blunt public support for Kyiv.
But the intelligence suggesting that Russia was willing to assassinate private citizens underlined to Western officials just how far Moscow was willing to go in a parallel shadow war it is waging across the west.
Papperger was an obvious target: His company, Rheinmetall, is the largest and most successful German manufacturer of the vital 155mm artillery shells that have become the make-or-break weapon in Ukraine’s grinding war of attrition. The company is opening an armored vehicle plant inside of Ukraine in the coming weeks, an effort that one source familiar with the intelligence said was deeply concerning to Russia. After a series of gains earlier this year, Moscow’s war effort has once again stalled amid redoubled Ukrainian defenses and punishing losses in personnel.

The series of plots, not previously reported, helps explain the increasingly strident warnings from NATO officials about the seriousness of the sabotage campaign — one that some senior officials believe risks crossing the threshold into armed conflict in eastern Europe.
“We’re seeing sabotage, we’re seeing assassination plots, we’re seeing arson. We’re seeing things that have a cost in human lives,” a senior NATO official told reporters on Tuesday. “I believe very much that we’re seeing a campaign of covert sabotage activities from Russia that have strategic consequences.”
The National Security Council declined to comment on the existence of the Russian plot and the US warning to Germany. But, NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement, “Russia’s intensifying campaign of subversion is something that we are taking extremely seriously and have been intently focused on over the past few months.
“The United States has been discussing this issue with our NATO Allies, and we are actively working together to expose and disrupt these activities,” she said. “We have also been clear that Russia’s actions will not deter Allies from continuing to support Ukraine.”

German officials declined to comment on the specifics of CNN’s reporting. But speaking on the sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington on Thursday, Germany’s Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said it shows how Russia is “waging a hybrid war of aggression” on European allies.
“We have seen that there have been attacks on factories. And this underlines once again that we as Europeans must protect ourselves as best we can and not be naive,” Baerbock said.
In a separate statement sent to CNN, the German Interior Ministry said that Berlin “will not be intimidated by the Russian threats﻿,” emphasizing that they are fundamentally aimed at “undermining the support of Germany and our partners for Ukraine in its defense against the Russian war of aggression.”
A spokesman for Rheinmetall, Oliver Hoffman, declined to comment.
“The necessary measures are always taken in regular consultation with the security authorities,” Hoffman said.
CNN has asked the Russian embassy in Washington for comment.
NATO members seeking to strengthen intel sharing
Russia’s sabotage campaign has been a major point of discussion among NATO officials gathered in Washington for the bloc’s 75th anniversary summit. NATO has sought to improve intelligence sharing across the alliance so that the nations will be able to connect the dots between what otherwise might appear to be disparate criminal activities unique to their own country.
But the campaign — and in particular Russia’s willingness to take lethal action against European citizens on foreign soil — has raised difficult questions about how the alliance should respond. In theory under Article 5, an armed attack on a NATO member state is an attack on all.
Russia’s sabotage campaign has, at times, smacked of a shotgun approach carried out by amateurs. Some of the crimes linked to the campaign have not had obvious links to the conflict in Ukraine; Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk publicly suggested that a fire at an IKEA in Lithuania could have been the work of Russia, for example. In Poland, CNN has reported, a Ukrainian man was recruited over Telegram by a Russian handler he never met in person and was paid just $7 to spray anti-war graffiti. Later, he was asked to plant surveillance cameras and burn down the fence of a Ukrainian-owned transportation company.
Some analysts have referred to the effort as a “hybrid” campaign, one that uses non-military tools like propaganda, deception and sabotage. But US and European officials are gradually hardening against defining Russia’s sabotage efforts that way.
“I fundamentally reject the idea that what we’re seeing is a hybrid campaign from Russia. There are hybrid elements of it. When I think of ‘hybrid’, I think of … defacing monuments,” the senior NATO official said. “Things that meet that traditional definition of ‘below the threshold of armed conflict.’”
Because Russia is recruiting operatives to carry out arson and plotting assassinations — lethal action — “I’m not as confident that those all fall below this threshold that ‘hybrid’ implies,” the official said.
It was not clear whether the intelligence related to Rheinmetall suggested Russia intended to kill Papperger directly or hire a local proxy.
Other Russian efforts have been far more serious than spraying a little graffiti or vandalizing a diplomat’s car: US military bases across Europe were placed on a heightened state of alert last week for the first time in a decade after the US received intelligence that Russian-backed actors were considering carrying out sabotage attacks against US military personnel and facilities, multiple sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
In April, two German-Russian nationals were arrested for allegedly plotting bomb and arson attacks on targets including US military facilities on behalf of Russia.
In London in March, several men were charged with working with Russian intelligence services to set fire to a Ukrainian-linked warehouse. Poland is investigating whether an arson attack that destroyed Warsaw’s largest mall in May was connected to Russia and has arrested nine people in connection with Russia-linked acts of sabotage, the prime minister said in May. And French authorities last month detained a Russian-Ukrainian man who was allegedly building bombs as part of a sabotage campaign orchestrated by Moscow.

“They’re doing it now because they believe that as there are a number of elections happening throughout the west, that this is a prime opportunity to try to undermine public support for Ukraine,” the senior NATO official said.
The official also said that Russia sees a window of opportunity before additional weapons and ammunition promised by the west arrive on the battlefield in Ukraine.
For Russia, this “is a prime time to target the west in these types of operations to try to undermine support and prevent the flow of weapons there.”

151,Isreal,2024,11,"Israeli attacks reportedly kill dozens across Gaza, including 27 in one strike",Mohammad Al Sawalhi,"CNN
 — 
An Israeli airstrike on a multi-story building in northern Gaza killed at least 27 people, relief officials said, as the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders in the area, where it is mounting a major offensive.
The home of the Mbahouh family in Jabalya was struck on Thursday afternoon, according to the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal.
He said the four-story property was sheltering more than 50 displaced people, and some had been trapped in a warehouse at the bottom of the building.
CNN is reaching out to the Israeli military on the target of the strike.
Also on Thursday, an Israeli airstrike hit Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City. Another killed at least four people in Al-Rimal School, west of Gaza City, Basal said.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed the airstrike on Al-Shati refugee camp and claimed the school was used as a “command and control center” by Hamas. The IDF said it not comment on the second attack without coordinates.
The Israeli military campaign in Gaza since the October 7 Hamas-led attacks has demolished entire neighborhoods and rendered large swathes of the strip uninhabitable.
At least 43,469 Palestinians have been killed and another 102,561 people injured in Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health there.
Human rights agencies warned of “apocalyptic” survival challenges for Palestinians trapped in Jabalya, home to a large refugee camp, where the Israeli military ramped up aerial and ground attacks in early October that it says are targeting Hamas’ renewed presence in the area.
The UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, accused Israel of “making Palestinian survival in northern Gaza impossible as part of a policy of sustained pressure and forcible expulsion,” in a statement to CNN on Monday.

Israeli airstrikes and shelling reportedly killed at least 30 other people in Gaza since Wednesday. Most of those Palestinians were killed by Israeli attacks in the Beit Lahiya area of northern Gaza.
An Israeli airstrike struck a residential building in the Mashrou’ neighborhood of Beit Lahiya, killing six people and injuring several others, journalists and medics say, who added that a further six people were killed in second strike in the same area. Four others were killed in a separate drone strike in Beit Lahiya, they said.
In addition, six people had been killed, according to local journalists, as a result of Israeli artillery shelling west of Jabalya camp in northern Gaza.
The head of field hospitals in Gaza, Dr. Marwan Al-Hams, told CNN Thursday that the “health situation in the north is more than catastrophic… Three hospitals in the north of the Strip are out of service, and we cannot perform surgeries.”
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said that “troops started to operate in the area of Beit Lahiya following prior intelligence information and a situational assessment indicating the presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure.”
The IDF said it also continues operations in Jabalya in northern Gaza and had killed some “50 terrorists” over the past day.
‘A new Nakba’
An aid worker displaced in Gaza City recounted the mental anguish of being uprooted from one neighborhood to another, after the Israeli military issued fresh evacuation orders to Palestinians in northern Gaza on Thursday.
Mahmoud Shalabi, the deputy director of programmes for MAP, said he has been forced to flee at least seven times since October 2023 – including from northern Gaza to Gaza City. Shalabi’s testimony was shared with CNN by MAP.
“I am really unsure whether I will be able to see my home again. And even if I am allowed to go back, will our homes remain as they are?” he said on Thursday. “It’s as if it’s a new Nakba.
“We are being forced to flee from our homes under brutal force,” he added. “My three children keep asking me, ‘When are we going to return back home?’ And I really can’t answer that question.
“To exist on this land is to resist,” said Shalabi. “I will not leave. I want to live a dignified life.”

Adraee said that the “specified area has been warned multiple times previously. We inform you that the specified area is considered a dangerous combat zone, so for your safety, move south immediately.”
Elsewhere, in central Gaza, according to a CNN stringer at the scene, Civil Defense said it had recovered eight bodies after a strike in Al-Nuseirat refugee camp on Wednesday night.
A male witness, Salim Mohammed Alaa Abu Najeh, told CNN that his sister’s home was targeted.
“They were at home when suddenly a missile hit their building… They have no connection to any organizations or anything like that. They were unarmed, poor people with difficult circumstances, who struggled to build this home.”
Among those in the building were orphans who had been raised by their grandmother, Abu Najeh said.
CNN has asked the IDF about the target of the attack.

The Palestine Red Crescent said paramedics had transferred five bodies to hospital as a result of an Israeli drone attack in the Al-Janina neighborhood, east of Rafah city in the southern Gaza Strip. Journalists said four of those killed were from the same family.
Additionally, they said, two people were killed in a strike launched from an Israeli military quadcopter.

 — 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant after months of clashes over domestic politics and Israel’s war efforts.
In a recorded statement Tuesday evening, Netanyahu said that “trust between me and the minister of defense has cracked.”
Israel Katz, currently the foreign minister, will become defense minister. Gideon Sa’ar will replace Katz as foreign minister, the prime minister’s office said Tuesday. Neither has extensive military experience, though Katz has served in the cabinet throughout the war.
The move came as voters in the United States, Israel’s most important ally, voted for their next president. Gallant is a close interlocutor for the US administration, and has been said to have daily conversations with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
The reshuffle happened at a crucial moment for Israel, which is fighting bloody wars in Gaza and Lebanon while awaiting a potential retaliatory attack from Iran.
Gallant responded to the decision shortly after it was made public, posting on X that the “security of Israel has been and will always be my lifelong mission.” In a televised statement, he said his dismissal was the result of a dispute over three things: the issue of ultra-Orthodox military service, the abandonment of hostages in Gaza, and the need for an official inquiry into Hamas’ October 7 attack.

“There isn’t and won’t be forgiveness for abandoning the hostages,” he said. “This will be a ‘mark of Cain’ that the Israeli society bears, as well as those leading through this wrong path.”
Netanyahu said Tuesday he had “made many attempts” to bridge differences with Gallant, but that they “kept widening” and “came to the public’s knowledge in an unacceptable manner.” He continued: “Worse than that, they came to the knowledge of the enemy - our enemies enjoyed it and greatly benefited from it.”

Police arrest Netanyahu aide as opponents accuse him of leaking intelligence to thwart Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal
Israel’s political class has long speculated that Netanyahu would fire Gallant and replace him with a political ally to shore up his domestic power. Netanyahu has struggled to maintain a hold over his fragile, right-wing governing coalition and its muddle of competing interests, whose collapse could spell the end of his leadership.
When Netanyahu first sought to fire Gallant last year, over his opposition to proposed judicial reforms, it led to mass nationwide demonstrations. Minutes after Netanyahu made the announcement, opposition leaders called for Israelis to take to the streets in protest.
Demonstrations erupted in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Protestors outside Netanyahu’s residence in Jerusalem shouted “shame!” In Tel Aviv, protesters blocked a main highway while families of hostages held in Gaza chanted “Bibi is a traitor,” using the prime minister’s nickname.
Einav Zangauker, whose son Matan is still in Gaza, said in a statement that firing Gallant “during a war and appointing a yes-man, who lacks security related experience, in his place, is sending a clear message – no one will stand up to Netanyahu and prevent him from torpedoing deals and prolonging the war.”
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called it an “act of madness.”
“Netanyahu is selling out Israel’s security and IDF (Israel Defense Forces) soldiers for his despicable political survival,” Lapid posted on X Tuesday.

Clashes over the war and domestic politics
The relationship between both men was rarely cordial and often caustic. There was little love lost between them – over the state of negotiations with Hamas, Israel’s military strategy and Netanyahu’s bid to bring in a sweeping overhaul of the judiciary in 2023.
Netanyahu and Gallant have often disagreed over the war in Gaza. In August, Gallant told a closed-door Knesset committee that Netanyahu’s goal of “absolute victory” in Gaza was “nonsense,” according to Israeli media. Netanyahu then took the extraordinary step of releasing a press statement accusing Gallant of adopting an “anti-Israel narrative.”
Gallant was also highly critical of Netanyahu’s emphasis on controlling the Gaza-Egypt border, known as the Philadelphi Corridor. He said that prioritizing its control over a ceasefire and hostage deal was a “moral disgrace.” In the cabinet, he voted against continued occupation there. “If we want the hostages alive, we don’t have time,” he said.

Israel’s top court rules ultra-Orthodox Jews must be drafted into military, in blow to Netanyahu
But it may be domestic politics that ultimately played the biggest role.
Netanyahu on Tuesday was forced to withdraw draft legislation that would have allowed ultra-Orthodox Israelis to get government subsidies for daycare even if the father of the children does not serve in the IDF, as all other Jewish Israelis must do. Netanyahu relies on ultra-Orthodox parties to govern, and they have threatened to upend his coalition if they are forced to serve in the military en masse.
Gallant had been outspoken against the idea that ultra-Orthodox Israelis be exempt from service, saying that “the security system under my leadership will not submit it to legislation.”
Sa’ar, whom Netanyahu has tapped for foreign minister, is thought to be an influential interlocutor to the ultra-Orthodox parties. Netanyahu, in his statement, said that Sa’ar’s appointment “will enhance the stability of the coalition and the stability of the government, and these are very important at any time, but especially at wartime.”
Also on Tuesday, Israeli police announced that a criminal investigation had been opened “concerning events at the outset of the war,” without offering further details. Israeli media reported the investigation is related to suspicions that records of sensitive cabinet and security meetings were allegedly changed.
Gallant has repeatedly called for an official inquiry into the October 7 attack. It is the second investigation this week that threatens to ensnare Netanyahu. On Sunday, a court revealed that police had arrested a top Netanyahu aide for allegedly leaking classified and faked intelligence to foreign media.

Netanyahu had faced pressure from far-right members of his cabinet to dismiss him. On Tuesday, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir congratulated Netanyahu, accusing Gallant of being an impediment to “complete victory.”
Netanyahu’s relationship with Gallant deteriorated when the prime minister threatened to fire him in March 2023, after he criticized the government’s judicial overhaul legislation. The bill, which provoked widespread popular protests in Israel, would have granted the ruling coalition more sway in selecting judges.
Gallant was the first minister to oppose it, saying: “The deepening split is seeping into the military and security agencies - this is a clear, immediate and real danger to Israel’s security. I will not facilitate this.”
Netanyahu said he would fire the defense minister, but reversed his position following pressure. The rancor between the two men has persisted and grown since the Hamas attack last October.
Following news of the firing, US officials reiterated their partnership with Israel. “Minister Gallant has been a trusted partner as Israel’s Minister of Defense,” Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement.
“America’s commitment to Israel’s security remains ironclad and the U.S. Department of Defense will continue to work closely with Israel’s next Minister of Defense.”

CNN
 — 
If his first term in the White House is any indication, President-elect Donald Trump is likely to keep the Middle East high on his agenda.
During his first four years, Trump made history by selecting Saudi Arabia for his first foreign trip, attempted to broker a “deal of the century” between Israelis and Palestinians, strengthened the Jewish state’s regional integration, and significantly intensified pressure on Iran.
But the Middle East has changed significantly since he left office in 2021, and all regional actors are keenly watching how the new president will navigate these shifts.
“Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America. This is a huge victory!” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted on X on Wednesday.
Gulf Arab states also welcomed the president-elect’s victory. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman congratulated Trump, and the United Arab Emirates said: “the UAE and US are united by our enduring partnership based on shared ambitions for progress.”
Iran downplayed the significance of the election, saying there is “no significant difference” in who becomes president in the US, state media reported. Fatemeh Mohajerani, spokesperson for the government, was cited by Iranian media as saying that the “general policies of the US and Iran are unchanged” after Wednesday’s ballot.
Here’s how Trump’s election could affect key players in the Middle East:
Israel and the Palestinians
Ending the wars in Gaza and Lebanon and integrating Israel in the Middle East are likely to be at the top of the president-elect’s Middle East agenda, analysts said.
“Netanyahu will face a much tougher president than he is used to in the sense that I don’t think that Trump would tolerate the wars in the manner that they are happening,” said Mustafa Barghouti, leader of the Palestinian National Initiative, adding that for Palestinians, it won’t make a major difference “because both administrations were totally biased” toward Israel.
Trump doesn’t want those wars “on his desk as a burning issue” come January 20, when he is inaugurated, Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat, told CNN.
“He will say: wrap it up; I don’t need this,” Pinkas said, adding that Trump will likely ask the Israeli prime minister to “announce victory” and then strike a deal through mediators.

Throughout his campaign, Trump has not specified how he would approach the Israel-Hamas war if reelected, or how his policies would differ from predecessor Joe Biden’s. In April, Trump did say that Israel needs to “finish what they started” and “get it over with fast,” noting that it was “losing the PR war” because of the images coming out of Gaza.
Trump, Pinkas said, “couldn’t care less about the Palestinian issue.” During his first term, he didn’t throw his weight behind the US’ longstanding support for an independent Palestinian state, saying he would like the solution “that both parties like.”
There is fear, said Barghouti, that Trump may allow Israel to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which would spell “the end of the two-state solution.”

During his first term, Trump took several steps in Israel’s favor. In 2017, he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upending decades of US policy and international consensus. He also recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 war.
But while Trump has often claimed to be most pro-Israel president in modern history, and even touted his close and personal relationship with Netanyahu, ties between the two leaders haven’t always been friendly.
In 2021, when both were out of office, Trump accused Netanyahu of betrayal when the Israeli leader congratulated Biden on winning the presidency in 2020.
Shortly after Hamas’ October 7 attack on Israel last year, Trump criticized Netanyahu and Israeli intelligence services for being unprepared, claiming the attack would not have occurred if he was president.

Boaz Bismuth, a member of Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, from Netanyahu’s Likud party, told CNN that Trump’s election came at “the right time” as it would provide an opportunity to expand the Abraham Accords as the wars in Gaza and Lebanon are coming to an end.
The accords, a set of agreements facilitated by Trump’s first administration that saw Israel normalize relations with four Arab nations, put prospects of an independent Palestinian state on the back burner, he said.
“When the war will be over, you’ll need a real restart in the Middle East,” and Trump will be the best person to bring about a “new Middle East,” Bismuth added.
Nadav Shtrauchler, a political strategist who has worked closely with Netanyahu, said Trump’s election sends a message to Israel’s enemies in Iran.
The Israeli prime minister is also likely emboldened domestically, a day after he fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant after months of clashes over domestic politics and Israel’s war efforts.
“He’ll calculate his next moves maybe different from he would if Harris was elected,” Shtrauchler said, adding that Trump’s unpredictability could mean that there will be more pressure on Israel to end the wars in Gaza and Lebanon, potentially to refocus efforts at confronting Iran.
Iran
The next four years could be the Islamic Republic’s biggest test since its founding in 1979, with Tehran under Trump’s scrutiny that would most likely lead to a return of the “maximum pressure” campaign he imposed during his last presidency, which increased Iran’s isolation and crippled its economy, experts say.
Trump, who prides himself as a master dealmaker, failed to contain Tehran’s influence in the Middle East despite withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear agreement to curtail Iran’s nuclear program, reimposing sanctions on it, and even ordering the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the military commander who oversaw ties with Iran’s proxies in the region.

Since Trump left office in 2020, Iran has ramped up enrichment of uranium, increased its oil exports, stepped up support for regional militant groups, and has set a precedent by striking Israel in a direct attack twice.
But as Israel continues to degrade Tehran’s regional capabilities by striking its proxies, Iran finds itself losing its deterring powers as it faces economic turmoil and widespread internal discontent.
“The Islamic Republic appears as fragile as the threats against it are formidable,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project and senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, adding that 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has limited bandwidth to be dealing with all the crises happening at the same time.
As the Middle East teeters on the brink of a wider war, with Iran threatening to respond to an Israeli attack on its territory this month, there are concerns that Trump’s election may empower Netanyahu to strike Iran’s nuclear facilities, something the Biden administration warned against.

“There is one scenario that Trump will tell Netanyahu to finish the job before he formally takes over, that means we might see a sharp escalation in tensions in November and December – Israel trying to push its advantage to weaken Iran and its Axis of Resistance (of militant groups) before Trump comes to office… then Trump comes in and takes credit on being a peacemaker,” Vaez said.
That could change if the Biden administration decides to “pull the plug” on Israel’s ability to escalate tensions in its final months in office, he said. The US has already laid the ground for that by sending a letter to Israel last month warning of repercussions if Israel does not improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

With worst-case scenario averted for now, White House and Harris campaign still face a serious risk in Middle East conflict
An important factor in Iran’s relationship with the next US president will be how Trump responds to recent US intelligence reports suggesting that Tehran attempted to assassinate him – allegations Iran dismissed as “unsubstantiated and malicious.”
But there must be a clear distinction between Trump and the Trump administration, said Vaez.
“Trump might be attracted by the allure of outwitting the Iranians at the negotiation table because that for him would be the ultimate test of his mastery in the art of the deal,” he said, adding that during his first term, he was attracted to the prospect of dealmaking with Iran.
“Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!” Trump wrote in a tweet in 2020.
Vaez noted that a revival of Trump’s “maximum pressure” approach might be paired with a policy of “maximum support” for Iranian people – a potential regime changing policy. This, he argued, would make it unlikely for the two countries to return to the negotiating table.
“I don’t think anyone in (Trump’s) national security team would share the objective of reaching a mutually beneficial deal with the Iranian regime,” he added.
Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states
Anticipating his possible comeback, Gulf Arab states continued to engage with Trump after he left office. Analysts say that could prove fruitful for them.
Relations between Saudi Arabia and the US under Trump’s first term flourished. He made history by choosing Riyadh for his first foreign visit as president in 2017 and stood by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during the crisis surrounding the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the hands of Saudi agents in 2018, when the Saudi heir faced global isolation.
“Gulf states place a lot of premium on the ability to work with a likeminded leader and conduct relations through interpersonal contact… It reflects the way they do business with other countries as well,” said Hasan Alhasan, senior fellow for Middle East policy at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain.
During his first term, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were engaged in wars in Yemen, and both countries’ ties with Iran were at their worst in decades.
But Gulf states have significantly modified their foreign policies since, opting to limit their military interventions and reach out to former foes like Iran, while diversifying alliances in an increasingly multipolar world amid skepticism over the US’ role in the Middle East.

“With Iran, there is a chance that Trump reverts to a maximum pressure stance and given the improved relations with Iran (Gulf states) could be subjected to greater pressure from the US to abide by the maximum pressure,” Alhasan said.
One challenge that emerging middle-powers like Saudi Arabia and the UAE could face under Trump will be managing their closer relationship with China. Over the past years, the oil-producing states have expanded trade and technology ties with China despite competition between Washington and Beijing.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE were invited to join the BRICS group of developing nations, and Saudi Arabia was granted dialogue partner status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) – a China-led Asian security and economic bloc.
Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have used Chinese technology for key infrastructure, and despite pledges to limit Beijing’s influence on their emerging artificial intelligence sectors, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have increasingly relied on Chinese expertise.
“It’s a question of whether the Trump administration will exert greater pressure on Gulf states to decouple from China in certain areas, not to mention the tariff and trade wars that are likely to be exacerbated under a Trump administration which could have an impact on (Gulf) exports as well,” Alhasan said.
Trump also hopes to expand Israel’s integration in the Middle East but may face a challenge in Saudi Arabia’s refusal to normalize relations with the Jewish state until it sees a pathway for Palestinian statehood, which Israel has refused.
Qatar, one of the first nations to congratulate Trump, has become indispensable to US efforts in reaching a ceasefire in Gaza due to its relations with Hamas. Those relations may however prove to be a liability under Trump, according to Alhasan.
“They’re probably quite worried about what a Trump 2.0 might be,” he said.

A series of Israeli raids and airstrikes in towns and villages in the occupied West Bank that stretched overnight from Monday into late Tuesday have killed at least eight people, according to Palestinian authorities and local residents.
Two Palestinians were killed in the town of Tamoun, said the governor of nearby Tubas, Ahmad Assad, alleging that one of the bodies was removed from the scene by the Israeli military with a bulldozer. CCTV footage from the neighborhood, seen by CNN, appeared to show a bulldozer moving a body.

In the village of Al-Shuhada, near the city of Jenin, an Israeli airstrike killed two people, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, who were identified by local residents as a man and his nephew. Footage obtained by CNN of the aftermath of the strike shows bloodied footprints smeared along a dusty pathway.
Elsewhere, at least four people were killed in the city of Qabatya, according to the health ministry and emergency responders. Two were killed by Israeli gunfire, and two others killed when an Israeli military vehicle rammed a car and opened fire, according to residents and video seen by CNN.
Qatari-owned Al Araby TV alleged that Israeli fire in Qabatya also injured a Palestinian employee working there. Rabe’e Al-Munir, a photojournalist, is now hospitalized in stable condition, it said.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the incidents. Israel has previously described its stepped-up military offensives in the West Bank as targeting militants and “terrorist infrastructure.”
The bloodshed comes as violence surges in the West Bank, where the Israeli military has intensified incursions following the Hamas-led October 7 attacks.

Since October 7, 2023, Israeli troops and settlers have killed at least 775 Palestinians, including 167 children, in the occupied West Bank and Jerusalem, the Palestinian health ministry reported on Tuesday.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli settlers vandalized and set fire to vehicles in the city of Al-Bireh, in what Ramallah governor Laila Ghannam warned “could have ended in a massacre.”
Video taken by CNN in the aftermath of the fire showed burned vehicles, some reduced to ashes, next to an apartment block with burn marks on its walls. A community of residents, including young children, can be seen standing bewildered outside the block.
“I woke up to the sound, I started screaming,” said Ihab Al-Zahben, a father-of-four who lives in the area, to CNN.
The West Bank, a territory that lies between Israel and Jordan, is home to 3.3 million Palestinians living under Israeli military occupation, as well as hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis who began settling there some 57 years ago.
In total, nearly 1,600 settler attacks against Palestinians have been recorded since October 7, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on October 31.

155,Isreal,2024,11,US soldier injured earlier this year on Gaza pier mission has died,Haley Britzky,"CNN
 — 
A US soldier who was critically injured over the summer while on the temporary Gaza pier mission died last week, the Army said Monday.
The soldier, 23-year-old Sgt. Quandarius Davon Stanley, was one of three US service members injured in non-combat incidents during the mission, though two were immediately returned to duty after suffering minor injuries. He was assigned to the 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary), out of Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia.
Stanley joined the Army in July 2020 as a motor transport operator, according to his service record. He was medically retired by his unit on October 25 because his injuries meant he would be unable to continue military service, a defense official said. He died on October 31.
“Stanley was injured while supporting the mission that delivered humanitarian aid to Gaza in May 2024 and was receiving treatment in long-term care medical center,” Capt. Shkeila Milford-Glover, a spokesman for the 3rd Expeditionary Sustainment Command, said Monday.
“Sgt Quandarius Stanley was an instrumental and well respected first line leader in the 7th Transportation Brigade Expeditionary (TBX), especially during the mission to provide humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza,” Col. John “Eddie” Gray, commander of the 7th TBX, said Monday. “We will continue to provide support to his family during this difficult time. Our entire unit mourns alongside his family.”
It’s unclear how exactly Stanley was injured, though officials have emphasized that it was not combat related. Stanley’s injury — as well as the minor injuries of the two other troops — were first confirmed by Vice Adm. Bradley Cooper, deputy commander of US Central Command, who told reporters in May one individual was “undergoing care at an Israeli local hospital. He was injured out on a ship at sea.”
Stanley was transferred back to the US for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, in June.
The pier mission was a highly visible effort by the Biden administration to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza amid Israel’s war with Hamas. Due to repeated logistical and weather issues, the pier was only operational for a total of roughly 20 days, and delivered 19.4 million pounds of aid.
A recent report from the Government Accountability Office found that US Army watercraft — which carried out the pier mission — are poorly maintained and experiencing a low state of readiness due to “aging vessels, supply shortages, and obsolete parts.”

156,Isreal,2024,11,Israel has long wanted to dismantle the UN’s Palestinian refugee agency. The consequences could be disastrous for all,Mick Krever,"Jerusalem
CNN
 — 
Benjamin Netanyahu sat down for his regular cabinet meeting and had some words for a new ally – and an old enemy.
“Last week I met with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley,” the Israeli prime minister told his colleagues. “I thanked her, on your behalf as well, for her decisive words in favor of the state of Israel – and against the anti-Israel obsession at the UN.”
“It is time UNRWA be dismantled,” he declared.
It was June 2017: the beginning of Donald Trump’s presidency. The possibilities for Netanyahu – who once bunked in the childhood bed of Trump’s son-in-law – seemed endless. In a few months, the American president would buck decades of foreign policy precedent and move his country’s embassy to the disputed city of Jerusalem.
In the case of UNRWA – the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees – Netanyahu would not get his wish so quickly. It would take another eight years.
The Israeli parliament, or Knesset, on October 28 voted through legislation to ban UNRWA from Israel and prohibit any contact between it and Israeli officials. Israel on Monday officially notified the UN that it was cancelling its 1967 agreement allowing the agency to work. The two laws do not mean the immediate end of the agency. Nor do they technically prevent it from working in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. But given the near-inextricable link between the agency’s ability to function there and the Israeli authorities, they almost certainly mean the end of UNRWA’s operation as we know it.
On Monday, a UN spokesperson warned “there is no alternative” to UNRWA, adding that Israeli authorities maintain responsibility to provide for the population in Gaza.
“If the law is fully implemented and the Israeli government makes it impossible for UNRWA to operate, this will have no effect on Israel’s responsibility to provide for the population,” said UN Secretary-General spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric.
There are as many opinions on why UNRWA, which provides services and aid to millions of Palestinians across the Middle East, was banned as there are people to ask.
Many point to allegations by the Israel Defense Forces that a handful of UNRWA’s 13,000 employees in Gaza participated in the October 7 massacre, which saw 1,200 people killed and around 250 taken hostage. In a country still reeling from the worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, this has been a potent and impossible to ignore argument against UNRWA.
Others see the move as another step in the erosion of Palestinian rights and the removal of their distant but long-promised right to return to the villages, now in Israel, from which they and their ancestors were violently evicted when the Jewish state was created in 1948.
In any case, the head of UNRWA has said that the legislation “will only deepen the suffering of Palestinians, especially in Gaza where people have been going through more than a year of sheer hell.”
‘Low-hanging fruit’
Boaz Bismuth, a Likud member of Knesset, wrote one of the two bills to ban UNRWA, which passed 92 to 10. In the wake of October 7, he believed that dismantling the agency was urgent.
“I did not see December ’49,” when UNRWA was created, he insisted. Nor, he said, was he motivated by the claim that UNRWA perpetuates Palestinian refugee status. “All this is totally irrelevant for me. What was relevant for me in my bill was the fact that they participated on the 7th of October massacre, and this is why they will not work in Israel anymore.”
The Israeli government in January said that 12 UNRWA staff members in Gaza had participated in the Hamas-led attack on Israel, and later added more to that list. The agency immediately fired most of the individuals concerned. A UN investigation found that nine employees “may have” been involved in the October 7 attack.

The Washington Post in February obtained CCTV footage from Kibbutz Be’eri on October, which it said showed one of the UNRWA employees accused by Israel of involvement, carrying the corpse of an Israeli man killed by Hamas militants.
UNRWA to this day maintains that Israel never provided it with evidence against its former employees. The agency says it had regularly provided Israel with a full list of its staff members, and has accused Israel of detaining and torturing some of its staffers, coercing them into making false confessions about ties to Hamas.
But Bismuth said that “for me, UNRWA equals Hamas” – and his view is widespread in Israel. In a country where Netanyahu is politically ascendant against the odds, supporting his party’s legislation was plain old good politics.
“UNRWA was low-hanging fruit for this Israeli government,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime American policymaker in the Middle East who was a key player in the last serious round of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, in 2000.
A long history
UNRWA is nearly as old as Israel itself. The violence surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948 displaced close to a million Arabs from their homes in what had been British-mandate Palestine – an event Palestinians call the Nakba, or “catastrophe.”
The UN General Assembly, which had consented to Israel’s creation, declared that all the displaced Arabs should be allowed to return “at the earliest practicable date.” A year later, it created UNRWA “to prevent conditions of starvation and distress.”

To Israelis, UNRWA is an anachronism that represents the unrealistic and distant dream of millions of Palestinians to return to their homes in what is now Israel. That is what Netanyahu means when he says the agency “perpetuates the Palestinian refugee problem.” Philippe Lazzarini, the Swiss commissioner-general of UNRWA, has made clear that even if his agency were dissolved, it “will not strip the Palestinians from their refugee status.”
Israelis have long accused UNRWA of perpetuating anti-Israel ideology in schools they run. A UN-commissioned inquiry found that examples in textbooks of anti-Israel bias were “marginal” but nonetheless constituted “a grave violation of neutrality.”
Israeli leaders believe that Palestinians do not deserve their own refugee agency and should permanently resettle where they now live – assisted, if need be, by the agency responsible for all other refugees in the world, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR.
“What makes Palestinian refugees different is that they’re not seeking refuge in a third country,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian human rights lawyer. “They want to go home.”
‘What more do they want?’
Saleh Shunnar, displaced from his home in Gaza by the year-long war, knows what it means to be a refugee.
“Israel has always wanted to do this,” he said, speaking from a tent encampment in Deir Al-Balah, in central Gaza. “If they shut down UNRWA, that means there is no Palestinian refugee cause. They took away the Palestinian cause.”
Those fears run deep for many Palestinians. But concerns about the impact on so-called final status negotiations are “tethered to a galaxy far, far away, rather than to the realities back here on planet earth,” said Miller, the former American negotiator.
“I can understand why the Palestinians would regard this as a systematic first step to undermine the right of return,” he said. But the issues facing any negotiations over a Palestinian state are so numerous and so fraught that the right of return is far down the long list of obstacles, he said.

That is particularly the case when so many Palestinians face an imminent humanitarian catastrophe. On Monday, the head of UNRWA warned that the latest legislation will further jeopardize the trickle of aid entering Gaza.
Lazzarini said Israel approved an average of 30 daily aid trucks into Gaza last month – just six percent of what was going into the enclave before the war. However, the Israeli agency that controls the flow of aid into Gaza said 146 trucks entered via the Kerem Shalom and Erez crossings on Sunday.
Other humanitarian agencies expressed alarm over the two new laws. On Tuesday, UK-based NGO Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) told CNN that Israel had crossed “every imaginable red line.”
“From bombing and starvation, to systematically dismantling the health system, to now outlawing the UN agency on which millions of Palestinians depend for their most basic survival needs, Israel is attacking the very foundations of Palestinian survival in Gaza and, increasingly, across the region,” MAP said.
“These are the simplest of needs,” Deir Al-Balah resident Ghalia Abd Abu Amra said of the aid she receives. “What more do they want to take from us than what they already have? Our homes are gone, now they want to take UNRWA too?”
The massive tent camps for internally displaced Gazans have steadily become entrenched. Cloth walls become tarpaulin. Mud floors are replaced with wood. This transformation has been happening for decades across the 58 refugee camps run by UNRWA in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere in the region, as tent camps became residential blocks.

For millions of Palestinians, UNRWA functions as a parallel government. It is a vast organization that provides services that governments – whether in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza, or the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem – are unable or unwilling to provide. It educates half a million students. It employs 3,000 medical professionals. It helps feed nearly two million people.
“UNRWA has saved Israeli taxpayers billions of dollars over the last 57 years,” said Chris Sidoti, an Australian human rights lawyer who sits on the UN’s Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory. “Israel, as the occupying power under the fourth Geneva Convention, is responsible for the care, protection, and the provision of services to persons under occupation.”
“The international community has been doing that by its financial support for UNRWA,” he told journalists in New York. “So if UNRWA is kicked out, the cost for the Israeli taxpayer is going to be ginormous. So this is a decision that is bad for the Palestinians and ridiculous for Israeli taxpayers.”

Bismuth, the Knesset member who authored the UNRWA legislation, said that Israel would step in.
“You will not have a vacuum,” he said. “I feel good with my bill. Because all the services that they got – not only will they continue to get it, but we will even upgrade it.”
Indeed, UNRWA’s benefit to Israel had long been recognized by those in the government responsible for Palestinian affairs, said Nadav Tamir, a former diplomat who now serves as executive director of J Street Israel, a left-wing lobby group. He characterized their view as: “‘Of course UNRWA is problematic, but we don’t have another option, we need someone to take care of the issues.’” Before October 7, he explained, politicians could not overcome the “realpolitik” that UNRWA was an asset in taking a problem off Israel’s plate.

What that will look like remains a mystery to most. Miller is blunt: “Israelis don’t have a long-term solution.” In conversations with UNRWA staff members in the refugee camps around Jerusalem – who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak with the media – confusion reigned.
No one knows whether, when the legislation fully go into effect in three months, schools will remain open or medicine will be delivered. Tens of thousands of Palestinians who work for the agency could soon be unemployed.
“Most Israelis don’t really know the facts,” Tamir said. “They don’t really understand that there is no alternative. They think, ‘Oh, we can just bring another organization, or we could somehow do it on our own.’”
Even if the Israeli leadership decides that it can cast aside the moral issue of providing for Palestinian civilians, shutting down services for millions poses a threat for Israel itself.
“It’s a strategic issue that will promote more terrorism and of course all kind of epidemics that are not stopping at the border,” Tamir said. “So people who really know the situation I think are concerned. But most people and most politicians don’t really care about the reality. It’s all about the perception.”

157,Isreal,2024,11,Police arrest Netanyahu aide as opponents accuse him of leaking intelligence to thwart Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal,Irene Nasser,"CNN
 — 
Israeli police have arrested a top aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over allegedly leaking classified information to foreign media.
Opposition leaders say the intelligence was “faked,” and part of a ruse to thwart a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza.
The investigation centers on allegations that the prime minister’s office promoted to foreign media the claim that Hamas was planning on smuggling hostages out of Gaza over the Egyptian border and creating divisions in Israeli society to pressure Netanyahu into a hostage release and ceasefire deal.
Eliezer Feldstein, who has been named by opposition politicians as an aide to Netanyahu, is among several people being interrogated over the leak of “classified and sensitive intelligence information,” according to court documents. A court order made public on Sunday said that information taken from the Israeli military’s systems and “illegally issued” may have damaged Israel’s ability to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
CNN is attempting to reach Feldstein for comment.
A spokesperson for Netanyahu denied that there have been leaks from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), and that the “person in question never participated in security-related discussions,” apparently referring to Feldstein.
The PMO also downplayed the possibility that the leak impacted negotiations with Hamas over the release of hostages from Gaza, calling the claim “ridiculous.”
Opposition leader Yair Lapid on Sunday accused the prime minister’s office of leaking “faked secret documents to torpedo the possibility of a hostage deal – to shape a public opinion influence operation against the hostages’ families.”
Families of hostages held in Gaza have accused Netanyahu of repeatedly thwarting an agreement with Hamas, believing that an end to the Gaza war would force the prime minister to hold elections. Netanyahu is alleged to have, in the past, torpedoed agreements with 11th hour demands – something he denies.

The alleged leaks were the basis of two articles published in September, one in the Jewish Chronicle, in the United Kingdom, and another in Germany’s Bild, both citing Israeli intelligence sources and supporting a narrative being pushed by Netanyahu at the time.
The articles were published as ceasefire and hostage release negotiations were ongoing, but also as thousands of Israelis demonstrated almost daily calling on the government to strike a deal with Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home.
Those demonstrations intensified after the Israeli military announced on September 1 that six Israelis were killed in Gaza – four of them were due to be released in a first wave of the potential deal.
The next day, Netanyahu held a news conference and presented an alleged Hamas document he said was found in a tunnel in Gaza. The document, he said, showed that Hamas was trying to divide Israelis. “I am not going to surrender to this pressure,” Netanyahu said, and reiterated his demand that Israel control the Gaza-Egypt border, also known as the Philadelphi corridor. Doing so would “prevent the smuggling of our hostages to Sinai,” he said. “They can pop up in Iran or Yemen.”

Just days later, Jewish Chronicle published an article claiming that intelligence sources said “Sinwar’s plan was to smuggle himself and the remaining Hamas leaders along with Israeli hostages through the Philadelphi corridor to Sinai and from there to Iran.”
The article said that the information was gleaned “during the interrogation of a captured senior Hamas official, as well as by information obtained from documents seized on Thursday, August 29, the day the six bodies of the murdered hostages were retrieved.” It has since been deleted, but an archived version is still available.
The prime minister’s son, Yair Netanyahu, promoted the article on his social media.
During a news conference on September 10, the Israeli military’s spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, told a reporter: “I don’t know the kind of information you mentioned regarding Sinwar and the hostages in Philadelphi.”
During that same period, an article in the German newspaper Bild said a Hamas document it alluded was written by Yahya Sinwar allegedly showed how the group was drawing out the war and was trying to create divisions within Israel and build pressure on the families of the hostages’ families so they in turn could pressure the government. Bild cited an intelligence document and echoed the claims Netanyahu had made in his September 2 news conference.

In a statement on September 8, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the document cited by Bild was not written by Sinwar and that it was an old document found five months ago and “written as a recommendation by middle ranks in Hamas and not by Sinwar.”
The information did not “constitute new information,” the IDF said, adding that it was “presented to the decision makers several times, even before the document in question was located.” The statement added it is investigating the leak of the document, which “constitutes a serious offence.”
Following the court’s lifting of a gag order on Sunday, families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza pointed their fingers at the prime minister’s office, saying “suspicions indicate that people associated with the prime minister acted to carry out one of the biggest deceptions in the history of the country.”
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz – who quit Netanyahu’s wartime cabinet earlier this year – have seized on the alleged leaks as a failure at the very top of government, with Gantz calling it a “national crime.”
Both have blamed Netanyahu’s office for the leak, with Gantz accusing Netanyahu of leveraging the leaks for political gains. Lapid also questioned whether the leak might have been intentional as hostage negotiations with Hamas foundered earlier in the year, according to a joint statement by the two opposition leaders on Sunday.
“It is suspected that Netanyahu’s team published secret documents and faked secret documents to torpedo the possibility of a hostage deal,” Lapid said in a statement. “This affair came out of the Prime Minister’s own office, and the investigation must examine if it wasn’t at the Prime Minister’s orders.”

 — 
The Israeli military says it has captured a senior Hezbollah operative in an amphibious special forces raid in northern Lebanon.
Members of the elite Shayetet 13 force seized the alleged Hezbollah operative after landing on the coast in Batroun, a town in northern Lebanon, then took him back to Israeli territory, an Israeli military official told CNN.
The official added that the seized operative was now being investigated by Unit 504 – an intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
Israel’s Shayetet 13, which operates out of the Atlit naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast, is sometimes likened to America’s Navy SEALS. The Israeli military has previously described Shayetet 13’s role to CNN as carrying out “strategic sabotage activity across enemy lines, including damaging vital structures during wartime and the enemy’s seaports.”

Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA) reported Saturday that eyewitnesses had seen “an unidentified military force carrying out a landing operation on the Batroun beach” at dawn the day before.
The troops “moved with all their weapons and equipment to a chalet near the beach, where they kidnapped the citizen Imad Amhaz and took him to the beach, (then) left by speedboats to the open sea,” NNA reported.
The Lebanese government said its security services were investigating “an incident that took place in the Batroun area,” at dawn Friday.
Hezbollah released a statement referring to an incident of “Zionist aggression in the Batroun area” but did not provide further details. CNN has reached out to Hezbollah for comment.
The Israeli military official told CNN the country’s forces “will continue to act wherever necessary to protect the state of Israel and its citizens.”
The raid comes a little more than a month after Hezbollah said it had targeted a naval base on Israel’s northern Mediterranean coast that houses an elite Israeli naval commando unit – thought to be a reference to Shayetet 13.

159,Isreal,2024,10,Israel launched strikes on Iran in a retaliatory attack. Here’s what we know,Helen Regan,"CNN
 — 
Israel said on Saturday it had struck military targets inside Iran in response to earlier Iranian attacks, again raising fears that the long-running confrontation between the two powerful militaries could escalate into an all-out regional war that draws in the United States.
The Israeli military said it had targeted Iranian missile manufacturing sites and aerial defense systems in what appeared to be a highly calculated response that avoided critical energy infrastructure, such as oil fields and nuclear facilities.
Calling the strikes a “clear violation” of international law, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement that it “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself.”
But Iran also appeared to downplay the impact, claiming its air defenses had successfully countered the strikes in three provinces – Tehran, Ilam and Khuzestan – and that the damage was “limited.”
The Iranian army said Saturday morning that two soldiers were killed in the strikes, without clarifying where the deaths happened. The Iranian soldiers died “confronting the projectiles of the criminal Zionist entity,” a reference to Israel, the army said in a statement, which was published on state media.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel’s strikes on Iran had severely damaged its defense capabilities, without providing further details on what was targeted.
“Two days ago, we hit the head of the octopus. To the people of Iran I say - our struggle is against a tyrannical regime that threatens the entire region. Whoever hurts us, we hurt them.”
The US meanwhile described the attack as “an exercise in self-defense” that “specifically avoided populated areas and focused solely on military targets.”
Israel had vowed Iran would pay for its large-scale missile attack on October 1 that saw around 200 missiles fired at Israel, forcing people across the country to take cover in bomb shelters. For weeks Israeli leaders have been deliberating on the nature and scope of such a response.
Here’s what we know.
What happened?
In the early hours of Saturday local time, Israel launched direct airstrikes against Iran, conducting what it said was “precise strikes on military targets.”
The Israeli military said its air force struck “missile manufacturing facilities” that it said were used to produce the missiles that Iran had fired at Israel over the last year.
It also said the Israeli military struck “surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.” It is unclear if those manufacturing facilities also produced missiles launched by Iranian proxies Hezbollah, Hamas and Houthi rebels in Yemen.
Iran later confirmed the attack but said the strikes caused only “limited damage” in some areas, while images broadcast on state media showed the calmness on the streets of the capital Tehran.

Iran’s state news agency reported strikes targeting “military centers in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam” had been “successfully intercepted.”
Several explosions were heard west of Tehran around 2:15 a.m. local time (7 p.m. ET Friday), according to the state news agency. Iranian officials said blasts heard around the country were related to air defense systems being deployed.
The initial strikes were closely followed by a second wave, as video posted to social media by Tehran residents showed tracer fire and explosions illuminating the Iranian capital’s sky as dawn neared. A third and final wave then followed.
By about 6 a.m. local time, the Israeli military said it has concluded its operation, saying the “mission was fulfilled” and Israeli jets “have safely returned home.”
How did we get here?
Saturday’s strikes are part of Israel’s long-awaited retaliation to Iran’s missile attack earlier this month, as the ongoing war in the Middle East continues to escalate to dangerous new levels.
On October 1, Iran launched 200 projectiles towards Tel Aviv and Israeli military bases in what it said was a response to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others, its largest ever such attack.
That missile barrage came about 24 hours after Israel launched a ground war in Lebanon, opening a new front in its war against Iranian-backed militants.
Israel and Iran have been fighting a shadow war through proxies and covert actions for decades. In April, that war came out into the open when Iran launched a wave of drones and missiles at Israel in an unprecedented attack in response to a suspected Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in Damascus, Syria.

Iran engages in urgent diplomacy as it braces for Israel’s response to missile attacks
In recent weeks, Israel has ramped up its attacks against Iran’s proxies, including launching strikes targeting the Houthis in Yemen, and militants in Syria.
But it’s in Lebanon where Israel has refocused its operations after tit-for-tat strikes across the border escalated after Israel eliminated the leadership of Iran-backed Hezbollah in series of assassinations and airstrikes.
Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike on his underground headquarters in Beirut in September. Netanyahu had previously said his killing was “a necessary step” toward changing “the balance of power in the region for years to come.”
Israel’s war in Lebanon has since killed more than 2,500 people, displaced 1.2 million and created a unprecedented humanitarian crisis, according to Lebanon’s leader and international health officials.
In a statement issued at the outset of Saturday’s actions, the Israeli military accused Iran and its regional proxies of relentlessly attacking Israel beginning with last year’s 7 October attack by Iran-allied Hamas, during which more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and another 250 abducted.
Following the October 7 attacks, Israel declared war on Hamas and launched military operations in Gaza that have killed more than 42,000 people.
The UN’s human rights chief warned Friday that “one of the darkest moments” of the war is unfolding in the north of Gaza where the Israeli military is “subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and starvation.”

What happens next?
A major concern of increasing military escalations is that Israel and Iran will become entangled in a full-scale war, one that risks drawing the US – Israel’s closest ally and biggest weapons supplier – into the fray.
A senior US administration official said President Biden has “encouraged” Netanyahu last week to “design” a retaliatory attack that would “deter future attacks against Israel.”
In recent weeks, the US and other allies have urged Netanyahu to exercise restraint and avoid striking Iran’s nuclear and oil assets.
The US’ Gulf allies, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Qatar, expressed similar concerns as an attack on Iranian oil facilities could create negative economic and environmental impacts for the entire region, an Arab diplomat told CNN.
The White House said the US “was not a participant in this operation” and urged “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.”
By refraining from attacking Iran’s oil or nuclear sites, Israel has potentially left room for de-escalation. But it is unclear whether Iran will respond to this latest attack.
Israel’s top military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said after the conclusion of strikes that if Iran were to begin “a new round of escalation,” Israel will be “obligated to respond.”

160,Isreal,2024,10,Trump in Michigan makes play for Arab American and Muslim voters angry over war in Gaza,Kate Sullivan,"Novi, Michigan
CNN
 — 
Former President Donald Trump on Saturday invited several Muslim leaders onstage with him at a campaign rally in Michigan as he courts Arab American and Muslim voters disillusioned or angry over US policy on Israel and Gaza in the critical battleground state.
“They could turn the election one way or the other,” Trump said in the Detroit suburb of Novi, located about a half hour from Dearborn, which last year became the first Arab-majority city in the US.
Trump said in his speech that he had held a meeting earlier in the day with Muslim leaders. He was joined onstage by what his campaign described as “prominent leaders of Michigan’s Muslim community,” including Imam Belal Alzuhairi, who described Trump as the “peace” candidate.
“We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace – he promises peace, not war,” Alzuhairi said. “We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine.”
Trump has criticized Israel’s war in Gaza on public relations grounds, saying Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his military need to “get it over with fast.” He has also slammed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for not adequately supporting Israel, though the current administration – and Harris’ campaign – has largely refused to criticize Israel or consider halting weapons shipments to the country.

With worst-case scenario averted for now, White House and Harris campaign still face a serious risk in Middle East conflict
In an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on the first anniversary of Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attacks inside Israel, Trump mused about real estate prospects in beleaguered Gaza, home to roughly 2 million Palestinians.
“You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place – the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,” Trump said. “It could be so beautiful.”
During his first month as president, in 2017, Trump issued an executive order banning entry for 90 days by citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries: Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. The order indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and blocked all refugees from entering the US for four months. (After a lengthy court battle, the “travel ban” survived in part. Biden revoked the orders in 2021 immediately after being sworn in.)
The Trump campaign and its allies, though, have sought to seize on Arab American and Muslim anger over continued US support for Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and, more recently, Lebanon, by criticizing Harris and Biden from both sides – telling anti-war voters that Trump would secure peace and claiming to pro-Israel voters that the Democrats don’t have their back.
Trump has frequently questioned why Jewish Americans would consider voting for Harris, repeatedly saying that Jewish Democrats “should have their head examined.” At an event in September billed as opposing antisemitism, he even warned that “the Jewish people would have a lot to do” with his potential loss in November.
Harris, who has called for a ceasefire in Gaza and has said she supports a two-state solution in the region, has taken more heat from pro-Palestinian and anti-war activists, who have pleaded with her to break from Biden and say she supports conditioning military aid to Israel.
During a brief meeting three weeks ago in Flint, Michigan, a group of Arab American advocates and leaders pressed Harris “to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don’t agree with,” as Wa’el Alzayat, the CEO of Muslim American advocacy group Emgage Action, told CNN afterward.
Trump at his rally on Saturday claimed that “Jews, Catholics, evangelicals, Mormons, Muslims are joining our cause in larger numbers than ever before and now the most wonderful thing is happening.”
“The Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan and across the country want a stop to the endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East. That’s all they want,” Trump said.
Trump also, again, used Harris’s recent round of campaigning alongside former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, whose father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, was one of the leading architects of the US invasion of Iraq and the yearslong war that followed. Both Cheneys have endorsed Harris.
Hours later, Harris, while campaigning in Kalamazoo, Michigan, was interrupted early in her speech by a protester, who shouted, “No more Gaza war.”
“On the topic of Gaza, we must end that war. And we must end the war and bring the hostages home,” Harris said, as the audience tried to drown out the demonstrator.

 — 
Ten days before the American presidential election, uncontrollable war in the Middle East appears to have been avoided for now, much to the relief of President Joe Biden’s aides at the White House and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign team in Delaware.
“It looks like they didn’t hit anything other than military targets. My hope is this is the end,” Biden said after receiving an update on Israel’s strikes on Iran early Saturday from his intelligence analysts. 
Such an outcome was hardly a foregone conclusion at the start of this month, when a massive Iranian ballistic missile barrage launched on Israel led to fears of major, escalatory reprisal — potentially targeting Iranian nuclear or oil sites. Still, if in Biden’s mind a worst-case scenario was prevented, the larger knot that is the Middle East conflict remains as firmly gnarled as ever.
The direct attack inside Iran brings the region to a new, more dangerous place, with Tehran now mulling its own response to the response.
Biden and Harris joined a call Saturday with their national security team and were briefed on the the latest developments in the region according to the White House.
“We maintain the importance of supporting Israel’s right to defend itself,” Harris told reporters not long after that briefing, “and we are also very adamant that we must see de-escalation in the region going forward, and that will be our focus.”
Asked her message to Iran, Harris said, “We as the United States feel very strongly that Iran must stop what it is doing in terms of this threat that it presents to the region, and we will always defend Israel against any attack by Iran, in that way.”
Beyond Iran’s actions, however, the region remains at a boil.
Israel continues to expand its operations in Lebanon, which have killed hundreds of women and children and tested American patience — but so far not leading to a major break.
And the conflict in Gaza appears no closer to ending than it was before the death this month of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, whose demise Biden hoped would lead to renewed efforts toward a hostages-for-ceasefire deal.
That window of opportunity remains cracked, at least in the mind of top Western diplomats, and negotiations will resume this week in Qatar.
But few believe there will be any resolution before the November 5 US presidential election, leaving Biden and Harris’ inability to bring stability to the region a serious political liability.
That is not where the US was hoping it would be in the immediate lead-up to Election Day, even if full-blown war between Iran and Israel isn’t currently breaking out.
American officials don’t believe Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees much incentive to end his multifront operations before the election.
And there is little question in their minds Netanyahu sees former President Donald Trump — whom he has phoned up at multiple points in the weeks preceding Election Day — as a close ally.
Campaigning in Michigan on Saturday, Trump brought a group of imams on stage after what he said was a private meeting backstage.
“Muslim and Arab voters in Michigan across the country want a stop to endless wars and a return to peace in the Middle East like we had under President Donald J. Trump, have you ever heard of him?” Trump said. “They want strength in the Oval Office, law and order, and common sense.”
Speaking Saturday before heading off on what has become a rare campaign trail appearance, Biden declared himself “not surprised” that Trump was in regular contact with Netanyahu. He acknowledged some concern that the Republican nominee was not representing the US in those conversations.

For her part, Harris has offered little evidence she would adopt a different approach if elected. Questioned by a voter at CNN’s recent town hall in Pennsylvania about how she would “ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by US tax dollars,” Harris pointed, again, to the nascent ceasefire deal, without saying how she would succeed where Biden has failed.
But pressed by CNN’s Anderson Cooper on what she would say to voters who won’t vote for her because of their fury over the administration’s handling of Gaza, she said — essentially — that Trump would just make things worse.
“Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don’t know that anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened,” Harris said. “But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.”
Those answers have done little to convince Arab American voters to throw their support behind Harris, who has given them little to indicate she would not simply act as an extension of the Biden administration on the issue.
Abdullah Hammoud, the Democratic mayor of Dearborn, Michigan — a city with one of the highest concentrations of Arab Americans — declined this week to endorse any candidate, encouraging residents instead to “vote your moral conscience.”
“I have not found any candidate, especially the candidate with the party I’ve affiliated myself with, who has been willing to depart from the current course that President Biden has taken us down on the genocide in Gaza and the broader conflict that has now touched Lebanon,” he told The Hill in an interview on Wednesday.
A trip across the region this week by Secretary of State Antony Blinken yielded little discernible evidence either that Hamas was willing to update its demands for releasing the hostages or that Israel was newly interested in reaching a deal.
While a main focus of his attention was planning for a post-war Gaza, the steps to reach that day remain as elusive as ever.
For months, Biden has been trying without success to pressure Netanyahu into an agreement that would end the fighting in Gaza, which in his mind would lower temperatures across the region and potentially unlock a wider, transformative normalization across the Middle East.
He’s been rebuffed at nearly every turn, leading to enormous frustration and long periods of silence between the two men.
That pattern lent a degree of uncertainty to the past weeks, as Biden and his aides sought to discern how Israel would retaliate against Iran’s October 1 ballistic missiles attack.
From the start, they signaled a different approach from April, when Israel’s successful interception of Iranian rockets and drones led Biden to encourage Netanyahu to “take the win” and forgo a response.
The scale of the ballistic missile barrage made this time different, Biden’s aides said, necessitating action.
But in a notably candid string of public comments, the president made clear he opposed strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, and recommended against going after the country’s oil reserves.
In a phone call on October 9 — their first in nearly two months — Netanyahu provided reassurance those targets were not in Israel’s sights, despite pressure from some conservatives in his own government to seize a moment of Iranian weakness to go after them.
It made for a rare instance over the past year of Biden’s advice being adopted by his Israeli counterpart, even if Netanyahu had his own reasons for avoiding the most sensitive Iranian targets and made clear his country’s decision-making was independent of Washington’s guidance.
“It was extensive. It was targeted. It was precise. It was against military targets across Iran. It was in multiple ways, very carefully prepared. And again, I think it was designed to be effective,” a senior US administration official said late Friday.
“As far as we’re concerned, that should close out the direct exchange between Israel and Iran,” the official went on.
Whether that is what ultimately transpires, of course, is an outcome entirely out of Biden’s hands.

After Israel’s attack on Iran Saturday, US officials were quick to caution both countries against perpetuating the cycle of violence, but analysts say lasting de-escalation is not a foregone conclusion.
The airstrikes “should be the end of this direct exchange of fire between Israel and Iran,” a senior US administration official said after the attacks.
After reports emerged of explosions heard in Tehran, Israel in a statement said it launched what it described as “precise strikes on military targets in Iran” early Saturday. The strikes were in response to Iran’s barrage of missiles fired at Israel on October 1, in retaliation to the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others.

Israel strikes Iran in high-stakes retaliation
Iran said Israel “attacked parts of military centers” on Saturday in the provinces of Tehran, Khuzestan and Ilam, causing “limited damage” in some areas.
Iran appeared to have downplayed the Israeli strike, Iranian experts said. State media broadcast images showing calm on the streets of Tehran, with traffic moving and people going about their daily business.
Iran’s foreign ministry condemned the attack, calling it “clear violation” of international law. The ministry added that Iran “considers itself entitled and obligated to defend itself” after the Israeli strikes.
Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in Washington, DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “more reflective of their desire to de-escalate than a true assessment of the damage Israel inflicted on Iran,” like Israel’s attempts to hide damage caused by Iran’s October 1 attack.
Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense for Democracies, also based in DC, said Iran’s downplayed response may be “a strategic move to save face and keep US constraint on Israel.”
After several hours of strikes Saturday, the Israeli military said it had targeted manufacturing sites used to produce missiles that Iran has fired at Israel over the past year. Israel also said it hit Iranian aerial defense systems early Saturday to allow its aircraft to attack the other targets.

Israel’s decision to strike early Saturday morning came after weeks of deliberations within its security cabinet about the nature and scope of such an attack, Israeli officials said.
American officials have been keen to show the extent to which Israel’s attack was restrained and precise, especially as the US pushed Israel not to attack Iran’s energy infrastructure, for fear of igniting a broader conflict, a request Israel seems to have heeded, according to preliminary reports.
After Israel’s retaliatory strikes against Iran ended, National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said the White House urges “Iran to cease its attacks on Israel so that this cycle of fighting can end without further escalation.”
But Israel has not always met the demands of its American ally. Throughout the war, Israel has defied the US’ calls for restraint – on the Rafah operation in southern Gaza, and more recently on a ground war in southern Lebanon.
Disagreements between the two governments culminated in an October 13 letter from the US to Israel, demanding the Jewish state act to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza within the next 30 days or risk violating US laws governing foreign military assistance, suggesting US military aid could be in jeopardy.
Danny Citrinowicz, a research fellow with the Iran Program at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a retired Israel Defense Intelligence officer who specialized in Iran, said it was too early to predict how the coming hours and days will unfold. “But one thing is clear,” he said, “Israel and Iran came closer than ever last night to the brink of direct war.”
“The ball is now in the Iranian leadership’s court,” Citrinowicz said on X, adding that the Iranian regime likely faces a familiar dilemma: to strike back for reputational gains, or take Israel’s attack as an end to the direct conflict.
Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that “if Iran chooses to exercise restraint… then this chapter may be closed, yet the conflict will remain very much alive.”
When Iran chose restraint after Israel’s retaliation in April, it emboldened the Jewish state to take out key Hezbollah leaders in Beirut, which triggered the next cycle of aggression.

Experts say that while Israel presses on with its wars in Gaza and Lebanon, any pause in direct fighting between Iran and Israel is likely to be short-lived.
As long as those regional wars persist, the overall trajectory of the Israel-Iran conflict will escalate. “While we may see some tactical de-escalation, the trajectory remains escalatory,” Parsi said, adding “a new exchange of fire between Israel and Iran will only be a question of time,” with the next round likely to be “more ferocious.”
Israel has long tried to push Iran and other Iranian proxies back into deterrence.  But experts say Israel’s strategy may not be entirely effective.
“Iran will not be deterred from escalating in the future if it so sees fit, neither would Israel,” H.A. Hellyer, scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies in London, told CNN’s Paula Newton, adding that deterrence is often used as an excuse by the attacking state, but only leads to more regional instability.
“It doesn’t de-escalate through escalation,” he said, “which is the most incredible thing I’ve heard.”

Donald Trump can claim a lot out of his 2024 election win:
► It’s a comeback for the ages for a president to go from a pariah after trying to overturn one election to president-elect after the next.
► A rightward shift in election results gives him a mandate to start trying to remake the US government like he promised he would.
► If Republicans win control of the US House of Representatives, he’ll have control of the entire US government to help him enact change.
What Trump cannot claim is a landslide victory, although that’s how he will describe it.
As of Saturday, Trump is winning the popular vote with a little more than 74.5 million votes, although millions of votes have yet to be counted in California, Washington and Utah, among others. The final 2024 popular vote tally likely won’t be known until December.

America’s red shift: See the counties where Trump boosted his share of the vote
When he lost convincingly in 2020, Trump got a little more than 74 million votes. So while it’s true that much of the country moved to the right in this election, it’s also true that there was some voter apathy if, at the end of the day, turnout is down from 2020.
That doesn’t mean this will end up being a low turnout election. The University of Florida Election Lab estimates as of Friday that turnout in 2024 will be about 62.3% of the voting-eligible population, down from the high-water mark of the modern era of more than 66.4% in 2020 but still above other recent elections. Turnout in 1996 and 2000 was not much over 50% of the voting-eligible population.
In terms of the Electoral College, Trump won 312 electoral votes. It’s a solid win, but in the lower half of US presidential elections.
It was a better showing than either his or Joe Biden’s 306 electoral votes in 2016 and 2020, respectively. It also outperformed both of George W. Bush’s electoral victories in 2000 and 2004. But it was far short of Barack Obama’s 365 electoral votes in 2008 and 332 in 2012.
Bill Clinton never reached 50% in the popular vote because both of his presidential elections featured a strong third-party candidate in Ross Perot. But Clinton did run away with the Electoral College vote, winning 370 electoral votes in 1992 and 379 in 1996.
Even those strong victories are dwarfed by Ronald Reagan’s 1984 win, a true landslide. Reagan lost only Washington, DC, and Minnesota, the home state of his Democratic rival, Walter Mondale, thereby securing 525 electoral votes and more than 58% of the popular vote.
Both Richard Nixon in 1972 and Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 exceeded 60% in the popular vote for their reelection campaigns, something that seems impossible in today’s political climate. It’s also incredible to think that two such massive landslides would occur within eight years. Nixon’s reelection rival in 1972, then-Sen. George McGovern, lost even his home state of South Dakota and won only Massachusetts and Washington, DC.
Voters were much more likely to split their tickets in those years. While Johnson, a Democrat, enjoyed a strong Democratic majority in the House after his 1964 landslide, voters who gave both Nixon and Reagan all but one state also checked them with a Democratic-controlled House.
The more recent trend is for voters to align their votes for House, Senate and the White House. That trend has led to a period during which the White House and Congress change hands more frequently, although Democrats will keep Senate seats in multiple states won by Trump this year.
Trump’s 2024 win marks the third straight presidential election in which voters have thrown out the incumbent party. The last time that happened in three straight elections was in the late 1800s when Grover Cleveland became the first president to be elected to nonconsecutive terms. Trump is the second.
Trump will never be on a presidential ballot again, because the 22nd Amendment limits presidents to two terms. But voters will get an opportunity to weigh in on how he and Republicans use their power in two years, during the 2026 midterm elections.
The past three presidents, including Trump in his first term, all lost control of the House after their first two years in office. If Trump does end up with a friendly Republican majority this year, he’ll have to work hard to keep voters on his side two years from now.

164,2024 Elections,2024,11,The common national experience that explains Trump’s 2024 gains,Ronald Brownstein,"CNN
 — 
The most impressive aspect of Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week was the uniformity of his gains across the electoral landscape.
But paradoxically, the very magnitude of his gains may offer Democrats their best hope of recovery in the next few elections. The across-the-board nature of Trump’s improvement suggests that his victory wasn’t primarily driven by the two campaigns’ tactical choices, messaging decisions or advertising strategies.
Trump gained ground in urban, suburban and rural counties and improved on his vote share, as of the latest counts, in 49 of the 50 states. A preliminary CNN analysis concluded that Trump ran better than he did in 2020 in fully 9 in 10 of the nation’s counties where results are available.
Those sweeping gains document how much ground Democrats lost this year — not only in places where they were bracing for further retreat (including both in rural communities and urban centers) but also the racially diverse, well-educated suburbs that had earlier keyed the resistance to Trump. Those losses leave Democrats in a weaker electoral position, in most respects, at the start of the second Trump presidency than at the outset of his first.
But the scale of Trump’s advance this year points toward a common national experience in all regions of the country — a shared disappointment in the results generated by President Joe Biden’s administration, primarily on inflation, but secondarily around other issues led by immigration and crime. The evidence that the outcome was driven largely by a negative verdict on Biden’s performance underscores the possibility that Democrats could recover sooner than now seems possible if Americans one day conclude that Trump hasn’t delivered the better results he has promised.
RELATED ARTICLE
Still-stunned Democrats begin to squint toward their future
The consistency of the Democratic decline this year “reflects a very broad sense of discontent across many different demographic groups, across every major population group, with the direction of the country under Biden,” said Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. Trump and the GOP, he said, face the same risk of reversal if the president-elect pursues some of the policies that voters remained uneasy about even as they voted for him — especially if he can’t ease the cost-of-living squeeze that drove much of this year’s result.
Experts agree that factors beyond disappointment in the Biden administration’s outcomes also influenced the results. These ranged from a widening cultural gap between Democrats and Latinos, especially men, to continuing resistance among some voters to entrusting the presidency to a woman, to the GOP’s successful efforts to portray Harris as an extremist cultural liberal largely through attacks on views about transgender issues she expressed during her 2020 presidential campaign.
But more targeted dynamics can’t explain a shift as comprehensive as the one the country experienced last week. Harris’ loss, as a quasi-incumbent, followed a well-established pattern: When an outgoing president faces widespread discontent over his performance, his party has almost always failed to hold the White House in the election to succeed him. (That dynamic applied when Democrats Harry Truman in 1952 and Lyndon Johnson in 1968 stepped down rather than seek reelection, and again in 2008 with Republican George W. Bush leaving office after his two terms.)
“People struggle to find explanations for what is going on with Hispanic men, or with young people, but the most common explanation [to all of them] is the right one,” said UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck, the co-author of well-respected books on the 2016 and 2020 elections. “Nobody thinks things are going well, and if you are the incumbent you own that.”
Two sophisticated new geographic analyses of the results underscore just how powerful and pervasive the movement toward Trump was this year. One comes from the Daily Yonder website published by the nonpartisan Center for Rural Studies.
The center has developed a system that categorizes the nation’s roughly 3,100 counties into six categories from the most urban (major metro core counties) to the most rural (nonmetropolitan counties). In between, the center divides counties into the categories of suburbs of those major cities; medium-sized cities; the suburbs of those medium-sized cities; small communities; and the rural, nonmetropolitan counties.
ANALYSIS
Trump is already wielding power and causing massive disruption
According to the preliminary analysis of the election results the group provided to me, Trump gained in all six kinds of counties — and by strikingly similar amounts. Trump improved his vote by 4 percentage points in each of the two most populous categories —the major metro core counties and their suburbs — and by 3 percentage points in each of the other four groupings of smaller places.
This was a more consistent rise than the center has recorded across the spectrum of urban-rural counties in any recent election. From 2004 to 2008, Barack Obama improved on John Kerry’s performance in all six kinds of counties, but Obama’s gains varied more — from about 3 points in the smallest places to roughly double that in the largest. From 2008 to 2012, Obama improved slightly in the three groupings of largest places but lost ground in the three smaller categories. In 2016, Hillary Clinton ran better than Obama in the largest places, but Trump ran far better than Mitt Romney, the GOP’s 2012 nominee, in the smaller ones.
Tellingly, the closest recent comparison to Trump’s uniform gains this year was Biden’s performance four years ago. Biden improved on Clinton’s share of the vote by between 1.5 to 2 percentage points in all of the center’s categories of midsized counties, and by 0.5 points in the two poles of their scale: the very largest urban centers and the smallest rural places.
Biden in 2020 did not gain ground across the country in as large a percentage of counties as Trump did in 2024. But, as the center’s data showed, Biden then, like Trump now, improved quite consistently across the map, from the most urban to the most rural places.
Abramowitz says the state-level results send a similar message about how much Trump’s electoral recovery this year resembles his decline four years earlier. In 2020, five states flipped from Trump to Biden; in 2024, they all flipped back to Trump (as did Nevada, which narrowly backed Biden four years ago). In 2020, Biden won Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, the three former “blue wall” states that decided the election, by a combined 257,029 votes. As of last weekend, Trump led in those three states, all of which he won, by a combined margin of 256,940 votes.
In all, Biden in 2020, according to the CNN analysis, improved over Clinton’s showing four years before in 42 states. That’s not as many as moved toward Trump this year; but both elections, Abramowitz noted, look quite different from the much more mixed results of 2016, when Trump improved on the GOP’s 2012 performance in 38 states but lost ground in 13 others.
Vavreck said Trump’s first election in 2016 produced a lasting ideological and demographic “reshuffling” that moved states with large populations of non-college White voters (such as Iowa and Ohio) toward the GOP while cementing the Democratic advantage in diverse and well-educated states that became light blue during the Obama years (Colorado and Virginia).
But since then, she said, the similarly uniform shift away from Trump in 2020 — and then back toward him in 2024 — points toward voter assessments of performance, rather than big further ideological shifts, as the main driver of the results. Just as Trump, as the incumbent, suffered from a negative verdict on his performance in 2020, Harris, as the quasi-incumbent successor to Biden, suffered from a negative verdict on the president’s performance four years later.
RELATED ARTICLE
We asked Americans what they’d heard about Trump and Harris throughout the campaign. Here’s what they told us
“A lot of that is kind of pure retrospective voting: Things are not going well, so kick the incumbent out,” Vavreck said. “In 2020, Biden picks up everywhere. Now we look from ’20 to ’24 and the Democrats are losing [ground] everywhere.”
A second new geographic analysis of the 2024 election results also underscores the comprehensive nature of Trump’s gains. The center-left Brookings Metro think tank for several years has correlated the election results with federal data that records how much each county contributes to the nation’s total economic output.
Those analyses consistently have found that Democrats now dominate the nation’s highest-output counties, which tend to be large metro areas that have transitioned the fastest into the 21st century information-age economy. Republicans, meanwhile, run best in places generally on the outskirts of the major metro areas that are more dependent on the powerhouse industries of the 20th century: agriculture, energy extraction and manufacturing.
The group’s new analysis shows those divisions largely holding this year. “The first thing to say is that the country remains extremely divided economically,” said Mark Muro, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro who directs this research. “That hasn’t changed.”
But the results this year also show Trump establishing what Muro called a “toehold” in the nation’s most productive metro areas, particularly across the Sun Belt. In 2020, Trump won just five of the 100 counties that contributed the most to the nation’s overall economic output, while Biden carried an astounding 95. This year, Trump has already won 17 of the 100 most productive counties and Harris 78 (with five still to be called).
Trump’s gains in those very high-output counties, as well as his success in flipping at least another roughly 70 counties from blue to red, has dramatically increased the share of national economic output contributed by the places that support him. In 2020, Biden won only a little more than one-sixth of the nation’s counties, but the places he captured generated over 70% of the nation’s total economic output. This year, Trump has already won counties that account for 40% of the nation’s economic output (with 161 counties still to be called at the time Brookings conducted this analysis late last week).
The highest-output counties Trump flipped were almost entirely in the Sun Belt: from Hillsborough (Tampa) and Tarrant (Fort Worth) to Maricopa (Phoenix). Trump’s recapture of Maricopa was especially dramatic, after Biden in 2020 became the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the county since Truman in 1948.
Muro says Trump’s gains in high-output metros across the Sun Belt, like his support from Elon Musk and other conservative Silicon Valley leaders, show Trump’s potential to establish a beachhead in new-economy bastions that almost all viewed him with suspicion during his first term. “This is the sort of the leading edge of the Trump governing base that now has picked up a number of significant economic centers in addition to its literally thousands of small-town and rural places,” Muro said.
The question, Muro said, is whether Trump can preserve that beachhead while pursuing policies he pledged, such as the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, sweeping tariffs, rescinding the Biden-passed incentives for clean energy and possibly also semiconductor manufacturing, and potentially moving to restrict civil rights and liberties. “The Trump agenda,” Muro said, “does not seem like one conducive to maximizing the output of the country and particularly the dense blue metros.”
RELATED ARTICLE
Why Trump surged in New York, but House Democrats succeeded in the state
Muro’s question about the high-output metros applies more broadly: While disappointment with Biden provided a huge lift for Republicans last week, moving forward Trump will need to sustain support on the strength of his own agenda, leadership style and results.
The exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN, as well as the VoteCast study done by NORC in partnership with the Associated Press and other media organizations, made clear that even as voters returned Trump to the Oval Office, many of them retained doubts about his agenda and personal style. Across the two studies, a majority of voters described Trump as “too extreme” and likely to steer the US toward authoritarianism, while majorities also expressed opposition to his mass deportation plan; majorities also indicated support for legal abortion and a greater government role in ensuring health care coverage for Americans.
The surveys made clear that those concerns were submerged by the towering discontent with the results of the Biden presidency. In the exit polls, about three-fifths of voters said they disapproved of Biden’s performance, and two-thirds described the economy in negative terms. About 80% of the voters who disapproved of Biden voted for Trump, as did about 70% of those who expressed negative views about the economy, the exit polls found.
As a result of those cross-cutting pressures, a critical share of voters who expressed concerns about Trump or his agenda in the two surveys voted for him anyway: For instance, one-fourth of women who described themselves as supporting legal abortion in the exit polls still voted for Trump. So did about one-fourth of Latinos who said in the exit polls they opposed mass deportation. About 1 in 8 voters who described Trump as too extreme, or said he would lead the US toward authoritarianism, likewise backed him anyway.
Vavreck said it should be surprising that even many voters resistant to elements of Trump’s agenda prioritized more immediate concerns — particularly their frustration over the cost of living, as well as issues such as the border and crime. Those frustrations created an almost insuperable barrier for Harris.
But in a little over two months, Trump, once again, will be the incumbent. And in Vavreck’s phrase, he and his party will own the results of the coming years. If Americans feel he has made progress on the problems they elected him to solve, he will likely maintain a strong position. But if they feel he has not, or if they conclude he has created new problems with his policies, there could be a turn away from Trump and the GOP in the 2026 and 2028 elections that is just as uniform as the movement toward them last week.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/trump-wide-gains-2024-analysis/index.html

 — 
Americans heard starkly different messages about Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in the final days of the 2024 election, according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracked what average Americans actually heard, read and saw about the presidential nominees throughout the general election campaign.
In the final pre-election survey, fielded from November 1 through 4, the single word most associated with Trump’s winning campaign was “garbage.” That incorporated references to several stories: the racist joke about Puerto Rico told by a comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, the former president’s own comment that the US was “like a garbage can for the world” and Trump’s seizing of a garbled remark from President Joe Biden to hold a news conference from inside a garbage truck while wearing a yellow safety vest and then rallying in the same attire with supporters.
The most common words used about the final days of the Harris campaign were, by contrast, remarkably generic: “campaign,” “rally” and “ad.”

Senior adviser to Trump campaign explains ‘massive disconnect’ between voters and Democratic party
The most commonly used phrase about Trump in the final week was “garbage truck,” versus “middle class” for Harris – but mentions of the former were roughly twice as common as the latter, suggesting relatively little consensus about the closing narrative of the vice president’s campaign.
The data doesn’t necessarily offer a clear-cut story about Trump’s path to victory, either. It may, in fact, suggest some limits as to how much a siloed news environment can affect vote choice in an election where partisans often diverged in their recounting of current events and where roughly 8 in 10 voters said in exit polling that they made up their minds sometime prior to September.
But the project, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, provides one account of how the nation experienced the campaign. In the abbreviated race between Harris and Trump, the research found, the single presidential debate between the two nominees in September was perhaps the last campaign event to draw truly universal attention.
Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org

What also stands out in the charts over time is the lack of a sustained narrative about either candidate. That partially echoes 2016, when researchers found that “there was no single persistent negative theme that emerged when we asked people daily what they had read, seen or heard about Trump.” That, Gallup’s Frank Newport wrote four years ago, “reflected his campaign’s ability to define news coverage through attention-getting tactics that defied existing norms of political decorum, and the inability of the opposing campaign … to come up with a powerful negative narrative to use against him.”
But the parallels to 2016 are far from absolute. In 2024, while no single story stuck to Trump, the overarching word “lie” did, reaching the top five words associated with him in all but one week of the election’s final two months. And notably, while impressions of Hillary Clinton in 2016 were consistently dominated by stories about her emails, no topic – positive or negative – filled a similar role for Harris in 2024.
On average, over the 20 weeks The Breakthrough survey was fielded this year, roughly 76% of US adults said weekly they’d heard at least some news about Trump. In the 15 full weeks of data following Harris’ entry into the race, a slightly smaller share – about 71% on average – said they’d heard something about her. There was less of a disparity in the final week of the campaign when roughly three-quarters of Americans reported reading, hearing or seeing at least something about each candidate – 76% for Trump and 74% for Harris.
Those numbers also suggest that the scope of the public’s attention actually narrowed as the calendar moved further into the fall. In July, the share who’d heard news about Trump topped out at 89% following the first assassination attempt against him, while the share hearing about Biden peaked at 84% in the wake of his presidential debate performance and subsequent decision to leave the race. The share with something to say about Harris never rose higher than the 77% she hit in mid-August.
Georgetown University, University of Michigan and s3mc.org
That pattern – a peak focus during the summer and a decline during the election’s final days – also stands out from the past two elections. In 2020, the share of voters reporting they’d heard news about Trump and Biden rose modestly but mostly steadily throughout the fall; attention in 2016 was more sporadic but peaked in mid-October.
The Breakthrough project also tracked the sentiment of survey responses – that is, not the feelings Americans expressed about the candidates personally, but whether the terms and tone they used to frame what they’d heard tended to be more positive or negative. In the first months after Harris entered the race, her sentiment score was more positive than Trump’s, the poll found. But that distinction largely faded in the last month of the campaign. Although Harris saw a small uptick in the final week before Election Day, sentiment scores for both candidates remained well under water.
Sentiments expressed by political independents when talking about the news surrounding Trump were negative throughout the campaign. Their sentiment when discussing what they’d heard about Harris, which was close to neutral at the start of her candidacy, declined modestly throughout the fall, undercutting her advantage over Trump on that metric.

166,2024 Elections,2024,11,Trump’s 2024 victory revealed voter shifts that could reshape America’s political landscape,Eric Bradner,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump won across the map — improving on Republican margins nearly everywhere and delivering on his promises to win over more non-White voters on his way to defeating Vice President Kamala Harris.
Now that the dust has settled on the 2024 presidential election, a dive into CNN’s exit polls and county-by-county results compared with previous races offers an even more detailed glimpse at how Trump won.
And perhaps more important for Democrats, the results paint a daunting picture of a party whose national coalition has fractured — with suburbs where they’ve won squeezed as tight as they can be, Latinos rapidly realigning with the GOP, and Trump posting the sorts of marginal gains among both urban and rural voters that are difficult to overcome.
Here are five takeaways on the voters Trump won and what it means moving forward:
The Latino realignment
A trend with the potential to remake the American political landscape is the huge shift in Latino voters toward Trump. His gains were visible nationwide, but were particularly glaring in Florida.
Trump cruised to a nearly 12-point win in Miami-Dade County, home to a massive population of Cuban Americans and a large and growing number of Venezuelan immigrants. He was the first Republican presidential nominee to win the county in 36 years.

President-elect Donald Trump is claiming a mandate after making inroads with multiple demographics en route to a popular vote victory. In this episode, we hear from a formerly reliable Democratic voter about why he voted for Trump this time around.  Guest: Nevin Skalko

...
Perhaps more ominous for Democrats outside of the Sunshine State, though, was Trump’s strong performance in the Orlando area, where the Latino population is largely Puerto Rican — and therefore the results more reflective of what’s happening outside Florida as well. Harris’ campaign had hoped the pro-Trump comedian referring to the island as “garbage” at a Madison Square Garden rally would pay off with those voters. But the results showed they had moved hard in Trump’s favor.
Trump’s 1.5-point win in Osceola County flipped a location that President Joe Biden won by 14 points four years earlier. Trump’s performance similarly improved in Orange County, home of Orlando, where Biden won by 23 points in 2020 but Harris won by just 5.6 points this year.
CNN’s exit poll showed the dramatic swing in Latino voters over just a four-year period.
In 2020, Biden won Latino voters nationally, 65% to Trump’s 32%. For Harris, the advantage was just 52% to Trump’s 46% — a huge slippage among a demographic that makes up 12% of the overall electorate.
With Latino men, the numbers were even more stark. Trump won Latino men by 12 points — a 35-point swing from 2020. If the dramatic shift continues in future elections, it could remake the American political map, with consequences ranging from presidential races to state legislative battles and more.

GOP’s big border gains
Latino voters’ shift was also on display on the border — particularly in the Rio Grande Valley in southeast Texas.
Starr County, which is 97% Hispanic, hadn’t backed a Republican presidential nominee since 1892 — and it hadn’t really been close: Hillary Clinton won there by 60 points in 2016. But Trump broke that streak this year, winning Starr County by 16 points. It was a vivid example of the valley’s rapid political evolution.
The tough-on-border-security message Trump hammered nationally hit home in the Texas borderland, where residents — many of whom have been in the United States for generations — feel the effects of border crossings acutely. Republicans’ cultural appeals and organizing efforts have also paid dividends.
There is reason for Democrats to believe they can stop, or at least slow, this shift. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz made gains but did not rack up the same huge border wins that Trump did. A Democratic incumbent, Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, narrowly held on to his Rio Grande Valley seat — though it was a much closer race than he’d faced against the same opponent in 2022. So did Rep. Henry Cuellar, the most conservative Democrat in the House.
The good news for Republicans: It wasn’t just Texas. In the swing state of Arizona, Yuma County — a border county in the state’s southwestern corner — went to Trump by 6 points in 2020. He won the county by 29 points this year.

Trump’s urban improvement
Trump criticized Detroit while he was in Detroit. He accused Harris of ruining San Francisco, where she’d been district attorney. He held a rally in deep-blue New York City, despite the state not being in play.
While the effectiveness of his campaign tactics is debatable, what’s undeniable is that the former president tapped into a simmering discontent in urban areas, where local governments are led almost exclusively by Democrats.
Trump’s percentage of the vote in Wayne County, home of Detroit, ticked upward by 3.4 percentage points compared with 2020. Harris’ percentage dropped by 5.7 points. And the Democratic ticket won the state’s most populous county — one where racking up huge margins is critical to the party’s hopes statewide — by 85,000 fewer votes than it had in 2020. Trump’s gains are explained in part by his appeals to Black men, and his efforts to reach out to Arab American voters.
The urban swings toward Trump were evident across the political map. He gained significant ground in New York City and the surrounding counties. But even small gains, like the 2 to 3 points he appears to have improved in Philadelphia compared to 2020, is significant: It chopped the Democratic raw vote edge there down by about 55,000 votes.
Trump’s improvement was fueled in part by Black men. CNN’s exit polls showed just a 2-point shift among Black men toward Trump nationally. But the shift was much bigger in some key states, like Pennsylvania, where Biden’s 89% to 10% edge turned into a 72% to 26% win for Harris, and North Carolina, where Biden’s 91% to 8% advantage was just 78% to 21% for Harris.

Harris’ suburban flatline
Headed into Election Day, two potentially outcome-deciding questions loomed: Would Trump’s yearslong efforts to appeal to men, particularly young and non-White men, show up at the polls? And would Harris be able to outpace him by further building on recent Democratic wins in the suburbs?
The answers: Yes. And no.
The only group with whom Harris improved on Biden’s margins was college-educated women. Her campaign had hoped for big gains with those voters — people who helped drive Democratic midterm wins in 2018 and 2022, and who might have backed former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary. It’s why she campaigned alongside former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who lost her House seat in a 2022 primary after vehemently opposing Trump, in the race’s closing days. But they were nowhere near enough to stop her overall slide.
One window into Harris’ failure is the counties surrounding Detroit. Oakland County, sprawling suburban territory that both campaigns had visited in the race’s closing days. Harris won by 10 points and 85,000 votes — short of the 14-point, 114,000-vote win Biden had notched there in 2020. Macomb County, where Trump had won by 8 points and 40,000 votes four years ago, went to the former president by 14 points and 70,000 votes.
Those marginal gains for Trump add up very quickly in a state where he defeated Harris by 78,000 votes.
Trump also showed improvement in the Western battlegrounds, including Nevada — where different mail-in ballot counting rules means the vote is being tallied more slowly, but early indications are that Trump made significant gains, particularly among newly registered independent voters in and around Las Vegas. Independents made up a bigger share of Nevada’s overall electorate than they did in 2020, and they swung 8 points in Trump’s favor.
Where Democratic presidential nominees can’t win
The deep challenge the national Democratic Party faces with rural voters was on vivid display in two states the party hasn’t won on the presidential level in a generation: Missouri and Kentucky.
In Missouri, policies broadly backed by Democrats won popular support. Voters this year approved statewide ballot measures guaranteeing abortion rights, raising the minimum wage and mandating paid sick leave.
Harris, though? Blown out by 15 points.
In Kentucky — the same state that reelected a Democratic governor, Andy Beshear, last year in a campaign that focused largely on cultural battles like abortion rights and transgender rights — voters resoundingly rejected a proposed school voucher program.
They also rejected Harris, handing Trump a 30-point victory.
Virtually across the board, Trump picked up even more votes in the largely White, working-class, rural regions where Republicans have long dominated. Those marginal gains made the challenge for Harris of putting together a winning coalition even more daunting — and, ultimately, impossible.
What Democrats will have to grapple with as the party enters a period of soul-searching is why the national party’s brand is so toxic with voters who have sided with the party on policy, and at times handed the party local victories.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/10/politics/trump-voter-shifts-nationwide/index.html

Pick one word to describe Republicans and Donald Trump, the focus group moderator asked, and one word to describe Democrats and Kamala Harris.
“Crazy,” said the White woman in her 40s, who hadn’t gone to college. Then: “Preachy.”
The focus group organized by Harris supporters in western Pennsylvania, not long after the presidential debate in September, was made up of a dozen people who voted for Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 but who were undecided this time, except for being sure that they’d vote.
Asked to pick between the two words, the woman said she’d “probably go with ‘crazy,’” anguish clearly in her voice.
“Because ‘crazy’ doesn’t look down on me,” she said. “‘Preachy’ does.”
In CNN’s conversations with two dozen top Democratic operatives and elected officials since Election Day, the fear isn’t just that no one knows the answer to what’s next – it’s that they don’t even know what the question is at this point.
“Why is it that Donald Trump did 8 points better than he did against Hillary Clinton in Illinois and yet down ballot, Democrats held every office and gained at the local level across the state,” said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who has already begun analyzing the results and planning for what’s ahead, with an eye on other down-ballot Democratic successes last week in Trump-won states like Michigan. “Donald Trump is a uniquely more popular figure, but what is it about him that makes him that way? We can all guess, but why don’t we actually look and find out?”

Democratic governors and AGs prepare for battle with Trump administration
Democrats’ shell shock is real, and not just because top Harris aides were telling Biden senior staff and former President Barack Obama aides past 9 p.m. on Tuesday that she was about to win. It goes to the core of their conception of their party.
A few months after Obama won reelection in 2012, his aides started a group called Battleground Texas, emblematic of their faith in massive demographic shifts, particularly among Latinos, that they figured would define a Democratic era, turn the Lone Star State blue by 2028 and lock Republicans out of the Electoral College.
Instead, Latino voters, Black men and other marginalized groups shifted toward Trump nationally this year, ushering Democrats into an unprecedented moment for a modern political party – grappling with gutting losses for president and other offices; being potentially locked out of power in Washington with no clear leaders; and an incoming president who campaigned on radically remaking America and punishing the “enemy within.”
And Texas went redder than it has since Obama’s reelection.

Some of the recriminations since Trump’s resounding win have taken a self-validating turn.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, fresh off winning a fourth term, issued a long statement slamming Democrats for having “abandoned working class people,” despite getting fewer votes than Harris there Tuesday and after four years of cheering on Biden’s record, which union leaders have described as the most pro-labor in American history.
Harris campaign senior adviser David Plouffe responded to the blowback from his social media post implying blame on Biden by deleting his own X account – even as other Harris aides complained to CNN that the decisions and consolidation of power by Plouffe, campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon and leading communications strategist Stephanie Cutter were what sucked the Harris-specific energy out of the run as they tried jamming her into being an Obama redux.
But what Democrats face is much deeper than the usual finger-pointing by a losing campaign or speculation about the next set of presidential primary candidates. It goes beyond easy comments about talking more to the working class when Democrats lost ground among nearly every demographic in the presidential race.
“The actual way to think about this is not moderate or progressive, liberal or conservative, but, ‘Are you with the people, and against the elites with power?’” argued Rep. Pat Ryan, a New York Democrat who said he massively outperformed Harris in his competitive Hudson Valley district. “That’s the reality for the people on the ground.”

Hill Democrats say their warnings about the party’s shortfalls on the border were ignored
Decades of Democrats talking about and making substantive moves to improve the economic standing of people outside the wealthiest didn’t make much of a difference. Nor did the measures enacted by the Biden administration and the forward-looking promises Harris made after she took over the campaign, much to the consternation of the president and top aides.
“In any political landscape, we need normal people to feel a sense of agency. We need people who are driving trucks and changing diapers and turning wrenches to run for office,” said Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, who won a tight rematch in Washington state against a Trump-style Republican she’d first beaten coming straight out of the auto repair shop she runs with her husband. “It’s not that we shouldn’t have lawyers in Congress. It’s that we need a body that’s representative of the American experience. We need to change our idea of who is credentialed and capable of holding elected office.”
“We don’t fix politics,” Gluesenkamp Perez said, “by becoming more political.”

No clear leaders, no clear path to get to them
From when Biden declared for reelection through when Harris took over, aides at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, would often brag about the “trusted voices” they were lining up – community leaders or niche celebrities who could validate the candidate to voters who weren’t sold. Democrats who won on Tuesday told CNN that getting to more wins and a future for America that isn’t forever defined by Trumpism would require candidates themselves to be those trusted voices.
One party strategist argued the focus shouldn’t be so much on finding a “Joe Rogan for Democrats,” as has become a popular postelection cause on social media, but finding Democrats who can go on Rogan’s podcast or similar outlets. (Rogan, who endorsed Trump a day before the election, had backed Sanders in the 2020 Democratic primaries after the Vermont senator’s appearance on his podcast.)

How Donald Trump completed a historic political comeback
Factors like that will define the next generation of Democrats, multiple leading operatives and strategists argued, even as some prospective leaders start making moves – Pritzker with a news conference Thursday vowing to stand in the way of any Trump attempts to hurt people who live in his state; Tim Walz drawing a similar line as he returned to his duties as Minnesota governor; and California Gov. Gavin Newsom calling for a special legislative session in a show of preemptively pushing back on the incoming president.
And more Democrats around the country are turning to Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, especially if enough of the outstanding races break their way to make him speaker.
But Democratic operatives involved in key races told CNN they don’t know how to figure out what those voters who went for Trump want, or how they’re doing in appealing to them.
Asked who she sees as potential leaders for the party going forward, Minnesota Rep. Angie Craig said it was “too early to answer that question.”
“That would be coming to a conclusion before we’ve actually had a true opportunity to dissect what happened and figure out how to move forward,” she told CNN on Friday, days after winning a fourth term in a district south of the Twin Cities.
Craig is a moderate. She’s also a married lesbian with a strong Democratic voting record, with four bills from her first term in Congress that Trump signed. On the trail, she talked about reproductive rights and freedom, but also about apprenticeships over student loans and getting tough on the border.
In a state where her popular governor was the No. 2 on the Democratic ticket, Craig said she ran ahead of Harris in a district the vice president barely won.
“If I’m talking to working folks and I’m really listening to them, when an administration puts forward a college loan debt forgiveness program, my immediate reaction is, ‘My God, my noncollege-educated working people are going to be really pissed off about that,’” Craig said. “If you don’t know where the American people are, or if you dismiss them and say, ‘Well, I don’t like where you are,’ this is going to continue over and over and over again.”
Taking ‘back the reins on what is sexy’
The concerns that have aired out since the election aren’t new. In sessions over the past year with up-and-coming House Democrats at his office in Washington, Obama urged them to think about how not to come across as “coastal elites.”
Find bills that seem like they’re relevant, he told them. Legislation introduced by Gluesenkamp Perez and New York Rep. Joe Morelle to clear the way for people to get the parts to repair their own cars and other products without going through the usually more expensive manufacturers’ processes was a perfect example, the former president said, according to people in the room. Another was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s campaign promise, fulfilled with an executive order on his first day in office, to remove the college degree requirement for a range of government jobs.

Where Harris’ campaign went wrong
Harris said in the final week of her campaign that she would sign a similar order on her first day in office, but it came in response to a question, almost as an afterthought rather than a big announcement or consistent theme.
“We need to take back the reins on what is ‘sexy,’” Gluesenkamp Perez said.
Pennsylvania Rep. Chris Deluzio, who increased his own 2022 vote margin in his district outside Pittsburgh and said he ran ahead of both Harris and Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, attributed his victory in part to acknowledging that the border was a problem but also to making local economic arguments that went hard at big corporations for raising prices in ways that evoked the New Deal more than “Bidenomics.”
“The more Democrats have gotten away from that, the more you’ve given space for a guy like Trump to yell about tariffs – and people want to listen,” Deluzio said.
To Deluzio, the woman in that western Pennsylvania focus group from September sounded like voters he knows in his district.
“You cannot have a candidate or a movement or a party be perceived as resenting people,” he said.

Looking for silver linings in a new generation
By the time of the next election, though, Obama will be 67, a full generation from his victory speech in Grant Park, and more time into his post-presidential life removed from the young voters – especially the young Black men he still feels most in touch with. Biden will be 86. Bill Clinton will be 82. Jimmy Carter, if he keeps holding on, will be 104. And though Harris’ concession speech was written in part to position her as a future party leader, several in the know said she hasn’t spent time thinking what that would be. The generation of operatives that came with each of them are aging out, too.
Democrats looking for silver linings point to 2004, when George W. Bush’s reelection and wide-scale Democratic defeats were followed two years later by the party taking control of Congress and then Obama leading them to victory in 2008 and ultimately a 60-vote majority in the Senate. They also note that Trump’s last election in 2016 spurred its own revolution in creating new Democratic stars.

Trump’s win was real but not a landslide. Here’s where it ranks
Much will change over the next four years, including culture and technology. Liberals will be entering a decade into outrage at Trump. A generation of voters will have grown up fully in the age of Trump. The scale of what he will do to upend the government and the economy can only be guessed. Politics is certainly going to change, in ways that are impossible to predict.
It already has, at least internally among Democrats. Because ranked-choice voting decided San Francisco’s mayoral election, Tuesday also saw what was effectively the first primary of this new era, with Levi Strauss heir and political newcomer Daniel Lurie unseating incumbent London Breed, a fellow Democrat, by running on a platform of rejecting liberal sensibilities in favor of managing a city that has seen spikes in concerns about street crime and open drug use in recent years.
In the end, the money and energy that went into Harris’ multi-city election eve concerts, which ended with Oprah Winfrey introducing will.i.am for a rehashed “Yes She Can” version of his pro-Obama song, missed what was happening on the ground miles from the concert sites. The millions that went toward those concerts – and the campaign debts left to cover – may turn out to be a perfect metaphor for the chapter of the Democratic Party now closing.
And to Democrats or progressive activists in deep-blue areas who still believe that the answer should be doing more of the same, just faster and stronger, those who held on this year plead no.

 — 
Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego will win a closely watched US Senate seat in Arizona, CNN projects, defeating Republican Kari Lake to become the state’s first Latino senator.
Gallego will succeed retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat, as he joins the soon-to-be-GOP-controlled chamber in January. His win is a bright spot for Democrats, who lost the presidency and their Senate majority last week. CNN has not yet projected the race for control of the US House of Representatives.
With Donald Trump winning Arizona, Gallego also becomes one of several Democrats who were able to win Senate seats this year while the president-elect was carrying their states.
The Senate election in Arizona pitted Gallego, a fifth-term congressman who rebranded himself as a moderate in the general election, against Lake, the 2022 GOP nominee for governor and a close Trump ally who pushed false conspiracies about the 2020 election and her own loss two years later.
Gallego on Monday thanked Republicans who voted for him, saying, “They took a chance on me.”
“And we’re not going to agree all the time, and I’m going to always seek the input, and we’re going to find middle ground where we can,” he said at a news conference shortly after the race was called. “But at the core, I’m always going to defend the Constitution of the United States and the interests of everyday Arizonans.”
Asked what he’d fight against with a Republican White House and Senate majority, Gallego said, “When it’s time to fight we will fight the administration. When there’s places that we can find common ground, we’ll find common ground,” but that he’d ultimately do “what is the best for Arizona.”
The race was defined by issues such as the economy, high cost of housing, illegal immigration into the border state and abortion rights.
Gallego, who would be the first Latino senator from Arizona, vowed to “fight to fix a broken immigration system and security” and to “lower costs on everything, gas, groceries, rent and more.”
Preelection polling showed Lake struggling to match Trump’s numbers, especially among independents.
Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, outraised and outspent Lake, who did not receive help from the main Senate GOP super PAC tied to Republican leader Mitch McConnell.
Born in Chicago, Gallego is of Colombian and Mexican heritage. He served in the US Marines and was deployed to Iraq. He has spoken about seeing some of the worst fighting there and has been open about his struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Gallego was first elected to Congress in 2014 to represent a deep-blue district in the Phoenix area. He previously served two terms in the Arizona House.

Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen will win reelection in Nevada, CNN projects, holding off Republicans from adding to their incoming majority in the US Senate.
Rosen, a former synagogue president who was first elected in 2018, is projected to narrowly defeat Army veteran Sam Brown. The Republican’s campaign had appeared to struggle to gain traction in this battleground state, but in the end, he kept the race close.
With Donald Trump projected to win Nevada, Rosen becomes one of several Democrats who were able to win Senate seats this year while the president-elect was carrying their states.
Democrats focused much of their attacks on Brown over abortion rights – with Rosen attacking him on the issue even before he emerged from a June primary. While Brown had said he would not support a federal abortion ban and backs exceptions for victims of rape or incest, he once backed a 20-week ban in Texas, which would not have made exceptions for rape or incest, when running for a Texas legislative seat a decade ago.
His wife, Amy Brown, spoke out during the campaign about having an abortion before she met her husband and how that experience shaped their views on the issue.
Rosen, for her part, campaigned on being a staunch supporter of abortion rights. Nevada, where abortion is legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy, was one of several states that voted this year on ballot initiatives to enshrine reproductive rights in their state constitutions. CNN projected that Silver State voters will approve a measure that would establish the fundamental right to an abortion up to the point of fetal viability in the state’s constitution.
Brown, who moved to Nevada from Texas in 2018, first ran for Senate in 2022. He lost the Republican nomination to former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who then narrowly lost the general election to Democratic incumbent Catherine Cortez Masto. This year, Brown leaned heavily into his endorsement from Trump, using the former president’s praise of him and criticism of Rosen in ads.
In both of his Senate runs, Brown faced accusations of being a carpetbagger.
In one case, Brown landed on the wrong side of one of the most politically toxic issues in the state: stalled plans to send nuclear waste to a federal repository at the state’s Yucca Mountain. Brown was forced to backtrack on his support for opening the facility after his remarks were reported.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/08/politics/jacky-rosen-nevada-senate-race/index.html

The State Border Guard of Ukraine had intended to use the trademark to sell a wide range of goods, as well as for publishing, education, entertainment, and sports services.

Associated Press
 — 
A doctor accused of criticizing the war in Ukraine in front of a patient was convicted Tuesday of spreading false information about the Russian military and sentenced to 5 and a half years in prison, part of an unrelenting Kremlin crackdown on dissent.
Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, was arrested in February after Anastasia Akinshina, the mother of one of her patients, reported the pediatrician to authorities. Akinshina alleged that Buyanova told her and her son that his father, a Russian soldier who apparently was killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv’s troops and had blamed Moscow for the war.
A video of the outraged Akinshina complaining about Buyanova was widely publicized, and chief of Russia’s Investigative Committee Alexander Bastrykin personally demanded a criminal case be brought against the doctor.
Buyanova, who was born in western Ukraine, denied the accusation, insisting she never said what she was accused of saying. In a tearful closing statement to the court last week, she had urged it to acquit her.
Her defense argued the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place, including any recordings of it, and alleged that her accuser fabricated the story out of animosity toward Ukrainians, according to the independent news site Mediazona, which reported all of the hearings in the trial.
In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said it was “painful” to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down.

“A doctor, especially a pediatrician, is not capable of wishing harm to a child, his mother, or traumatizing the child’s psyche. Only a monster is capable of this – and of the words that I allegedly said to them,” Mediazona quoted her as saying.
Buyanova’s case drew national attention, with more than 6,500 people signing an online petition demanding her freedom and supporters regularly attending court hearings. As the judge read out the verdict, they shouted, “Disgrace!” before bailiffs escorted everyone from the courtroom.
Her lawyer, Oscar Cherdzhyev, told reporters afterward that the verdict was “unexpectedly harsh” and “monstrously cruel.”
“We didn’t expect this,” he said.

172,Ukraine,2024,11,"Ukraine is fighting 50,000 troops in Russia’s Kursk region, Zelensky says",Ivana Kottasová,"CNN
 — 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that Russia has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk, the southern Russian region where Kyiv launched its surprise counteroffensive in the summer.
Ukrainian troops “continue to hold back” the “nearly 50,000-strong enemy group” in Kursk, Zelensky said in a post on Telegram after receiving a briefing from General Oleksandr Syrskyi, the Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces.
Russian forces launched offensives into Kursk in several waves on Monday, a spokesperson for one of Ukraine’s mechanized brigades said Tuesday, though none of them were successful.
“They stormed with a battalion-sized force,” Anastasiia Blyshchyk said, adding that Ukrainian forces destroyed Russian vehicles and equipment, and that “the Russian invaders were eliminated.” It was “a black day for the Russian occupiers,” she said.
Kyiv launched its incursion into Russia’s Kursk region in August, taking by surprise not just Moscow, but also its allies. It said at the time that the operation was necessary, because Russia had been planning to launch a new attack on Ukraine from the region. It said it was aiming to create a “buffer zone” to prevent future cross-border attacks.
The Kursk offensive, the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II, caught Moscow completely unprepared.
Ukrainian troops advanced quickly, deep into Russia’s territory and have since maintained control over hundreds of square miles of Russia’s territory. And while Russia has reclaimed some settlements, the line of control has barely changed over the past months.
A US official told CNN on Sunday that Russia has amassed a large force of tens of thousands — including recently arrived North Korean troops — to carry out an assault on the Ukrainian positions in Kursk. The official said the offensive was expected in the coming days.
The Kremlin has not commented on the presence of North Korean troops on its territory. At a meeting of the UN Security Council last week, Russia refused to answer questions from the US about its deployment of North Korean troops.
At the same time though, Russian state media TASS reported Saturday that Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law ratifying a mutual defense treaty with North Korea, while North Korean media reported Monday that Kim Jong Un had also signed the treaty into law.
The pact is the most significant agreement signed by Russia and North Korea in decades and is seen as something of a revival of their 1961 Cold War-era mutual defense pledge. It also consolidates the Kim regime’s powerful link with a world power that wields a veto on the UN Security Council.
Russia and North Korea have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but most of its troops lack combat experience.
Zelensky said last week that 11,000 North Korean soldiers were now in the region.
Separately, a Ukrainian commander told CNN Sunday that North Korean troops were taking part in direct combat operations in Kursk, as well as defensive operations in the neighboring Belgorod region of Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.
North Korean troops deployed to Russia’s Kursk region have fought Kyiv’s forces on the battlefield, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday, adding that the clashes resulted in fatalities.
Kyiv braces for second Trump presidency
Ukraine is once again finding itself in a difficult position. Russia has been launching near daily waves of long-range drone strikes on its cities while also struggling to hold back Russian advances at multiple locations along the more than 600-mile (1,000-kilometer) frontline.
Over the weekend, Russia and Ukraine exchanged record numbers of drone strikes, with Moscow launching a total of 145 drones on Saturday night.
Ukraine meanwhile fired an unprecedented number of drones towards Russia’s capital overnight on Saturday into Sunday.
At the same time, Kyiv is trying to gauge the impact of Donald Trump’s victory in the US election last week. Trump has previously said he could end the conflict in 24 hours and in September he declared: “I think it’s in the US’ best interest to get this war finished and just get it done.”

Russia has amassed a large force of tens of thousands — including recently arrived North Korean troops — to carry out an assault on the Ukrainian positions in Russia’s Kursk region expected in the coming days, a US official told CNN on Sunday.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday that about 11,000 North Korean soldiers are in the region, where Ukraine’s three-month military incursion into Russian territory has stalled.
The New York Times reported Sunday that some 50,000 Russia and North Korean troops are set to take part in the assault.
CNN has reached out to the Ukrainian government for comment.
A Ukrainian commander told CNN Sunday that North Korean troops were taking part in direct combat operations in Kursk, as well as defensive operations in the neighboring Belgorod region of Russia and in Russian-occupied Ukrainian territories.
“Mostly, the tasks are defined as the second echelon of defense. In the Kursk region, these are direct combat operations,” he said, adding that among the personnel were specialist artillerymen and snipers.

Ukraine’s war effort faces uncertain future as Russia mounts record drone strikes
“These groups will be directly involved in combat operations in the short term on the territory of Ukraine. They are highly likely to emerge in the occupied territories of Ukraine as well,” the commander said.
He said the North Korean troops were a “significant resource” for Russia’s war on Ukraine, as even those being deployed defensively would free up Russian troops for assault operations elsewhere and would themselves eventually be used in direct combat.
“In military terms, they amount to three full-blooded brigades. Imagine that now the enemy withdraws 10,000 soldiers from the second line of defense, puts soldiers from North Korea there, and sends these three brigades to one of the (places where) active hostilities are underway. Are three full-blooded brigades a significant resource? Yes, it is a significant resource,” Fedorenko said.
Reports that North Korea was sending troops to Russia began appearing last month, though both countries dismissed the allegations at the time. Russia and North Korea, both pariahs in the West, have forged increasingly friendly ties since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but most of its troops lack combat experience.
Ukraine invaded the Kursk region over the summer, shocking Russia, in the first invasion of the country since World War II.

Russia and Ukraine exchange record numbers of drone strikes
But Ukraine’s incursion hasn’t stopped Russia’s steady advancement in the eastern part of Ukraine, where its army chief has warned his forces are facing “one of the most powerful Russian offensives” since the start of the war.
Moscow is also unleashing near-constant waves of long-range drone strikes on Ukrainian cities and firing decoy drones without warheads to overwhelm Ukraine’s air defenses, according to a spokesperson for Ukraine’s air force.
The Ukrainian president said from Budapest on Thursday that world leaders are not listening hard enough to his pleas to allow Kyiv to use long-range weapons as it faces a “new wave of escalation” involving “the army of another state in the war against Ukraine.”
All of this comes amid questions about Ukraine’s future with US President-elect Donald Trump set to take office in January. Trump has promised to end the war in “24 hours.”
Throughout his election campaign, Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, cast doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv. They made comments suggesting the US could pressure Ukraine into an uneasy truce with Russia, causing Kyiv and its NATO allies to brace for the possibility of a dramatic reduction in US support two and a half years after Moscow invaded.

Biden administration to allow American military contractors to deploy to Ukraine for first time since Russia’s invasion
On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin made his first public comments on the US election, saying he is ready for dialogue with the Republican president-elect and noting that Trump’s comments on ending Russia’s war in Ukraine “deserve attention at the very least.”
Trump and Zelensky spoke the day after the election, when the Ukrainian president called to congratulate the president-elect for what a source briefed on the call described as a positive conversation. Trump put the call on speaker, and tech billionaire Elon Musk joined the conversation. The call was roughly seven minutes long, and no policy was discussed, according to a source with knowledge of the situation.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration on Friday lifted a de facto ban on American military contractors deploying to Ukraine to help the country’s military maintain and repair US-provided weapons systems, an official with direct knowledge of the plan told CNN. The move allows the Pentagon to provide contracts to American companies for work inside Ukraine for the first time since Russia invaded in 2022.

 — 
Since September 1, the Ukrainian capital Kyiv has been spared from Russian drone attacks on just one night – October 14.
Every other night, many of its 4.5 million residents have been woken by sirens and rushed to some form of shelter or hidden in their bathrooms.
In the first week of November alone, sirens blared for 43 hours.
The onslaught is just one indicator of Russia’s ability to prosecute its assault at full throttle, even as Ukraine faces deep uncertainty about future support from the US and Europe.
The cities of Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia and Odesa have also suffered frequent drone and missile strikes in recent weeks in what appears to be a renewed Russian effort to break the resolve of Ukrainian civilians.
On Saturday night, Ukrainian air defenses detected a record 145 incoming Shahed drones.
The spike in attacks on cities comes as Russian forces continue to make incremental gains in Donetsk, while Ukrainian units suffer from manpower shortages and are increasingly stretched along the vast front line.
‘Constant anxiety’
Residents of Kyiv have told CNN of long and frightening nights of sirens and strikes, with debris falling on apartment blocks, businesses and homes.
Viktoria Kovalchuk said that after debris from a drone fell close to her home last week her 6-year-old son Teo was “very scared and grabbed onto me.”
Kovalchuk said Teo was in a state of constant anxiety. “For the past two months, when the shelling has become more frequent, we have been hiding in the bathroom or going down to the shelter in the basement,” Kovalchuk said.

“I don’t remember when we had a proper night’s sleep.”
Businesses are also suffering. A man who gave his name as Maksym told CNN debris pierced the roof of his restaurant last week, causing some $10,000 in damage.
“We will restore everything on our own and continue to work as we have been doing,” he insisted.
Alarms alone are hugely disruptive to the city’s life. Bridges close, public transport is halted, and the two parts of the capital either side of the Dnipro river are effectively cut off.
Konstantin Usov, Deputy Mayor of Kyiv, told CNN that during attacks, “the city freezes … This alone leads to enormous delays in the functioning of the city’s economy.”
Many children don’t come to school during alerts, Usov said.
Many air defense batteries are run by volunteers from all walks of life – among them one of the judges on Ukraine’s Supreme Court, Yuriy Chumak.
Chumak told CNN that territorial defense units included members of parliament, an opera singer and a TV presenter.
“We have been doing this for over two years,” he said, but the intensity of drone attacks had peaked over the past two to three months.

Their equipment is low-tech – machine-guns on the roofs of eight high-rise buildings. “Drones were flying low, (so) it was realistic and cheap to shoot them down with a machine gun.”
“At night, we are on duty continuously. There are attacks every day now,” Chumak added.
The drone attacks seem calculated to instil fear rather than cause mass casualties, but several people have been killed in recent weeks. Among them was 15-year-old Mariya Troyanivska, described by her Kyiv school as an inspiration “who loved life and gave joy to everyone around her.”
The relentless attacks do appear to be eroding morale. The Kyiv International Institute of Sociology regularly asks people whether Ukraine should continue fighting for as long as it takes. The number saying yes has fallen from 73% in February to 63% last month.
‘Difficult’ front lines
That perception is likely fed by news from the front, where Russian assaults continue to erode Ukrainian defenses, especially close to the key hub of Pokrovsk in Donetsk.
The commander in chief of the military, Oleksander Syrskyi, said Saturday that, “the situation remains difficult and tends to escalate. The enemy, taking advantage of its numerical superiority, continues to conduct offensive actions and focuses its main efforts on the Pokrovsk and Kurakhove directions.”

After a two-week trip to Ukraine last month, analyst Konrad Muzyka of Rochan Consulting said the key problem is to integrate newly mobilized troops.
Muzyka posted on X that the Ukrainian incursion into the Russian region of Kursk “has stretched the already small Ukrainian forces even further.”
The Ukrainians are using a variety of battlefield drones to inflict losses on the Russians. Syrskyi said more than 52,000 enemy targets were destroyed or damaged by drones in October alone.
But drones cannot compensate for a shortage of infantry, Muzyka reflected. Despite a law passed earlier this year to improve mobilization, “the presence of newly mobilized units/soldiers is practically imperceptible.”
“We have a situation in which the Ukrainians not only cannot keep up with replacing losses, but also lose soldiers at an increasingly rapid pace due to falling morale,” Muzyka said on X.
Russian forces have become more adept at exploiting weaker points on the front line, enabling them to eat away at Ukrainian defenses within 6 miles (10 km) of Pokrovsk.
On many other parts of the 600-mile frontline, the Ukrainians are also on the defensive, with some analysts expecting another Russian push in the south. The only gains for the Ukrainians this year have been inside Russia, where they launched a surprise incursion in the Kursk region in August.
The negative outlook has darkened the mood among Ukraine’s allies, who talk much less about Kyiv prevailing on the battlefield – and much more about it holding enough ground to force the Kremlin to negotiate.
US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin implied as much. “No single capability will turn the tide. No one system will end Putin’s assault. What matters is the combined effects of Ukraine’s military capabilities — and staying focused on what works.”

Rym Montaz of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, assesses that there is a “growing, quiet consensus that negotiations, which will entail accepting at least a temporary loss of sovereignty over territories, are the only way to end this war.”
“Kyiv is at one of its weakest points since February 2022, and the prospect of selling such a negotiation is a political minefield” for Zelensky, Montaz says.
Victory, defined by the Ukrainian government as ousting Russian troops from all its territory, is widely seen as unattainable.
In a new essay in Foreign Affairs, Richard Haass says that “Washington must grapple with the grim reality of the war and come to terms with a more plausible outcome.”
“There is no game-changing weapon or lifted restriction that would allow Ukraine to simultaneously defend what it already controls and liberate what it does not,” Haas writes.
Ukrainian officials are putting a brave face on a gloomy outlook.
Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Saturday: “I am convinced that we are all united by the goal of achieving a just peace for Ukraine and stopping Russian aggression … We are talking about a just peace, not appeasement.”
The path to any negotiation is – to put it mildly – unclear. The Kremlin says its goals in Ukraine are unchanged: the annexation of four eastern and southern Ukrainian regions. Russian forces already occupy almost all of Luhansk and substantial parts of Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson – altogether some 20% of Ukraine.
“If Ukraine wants to persuade Russia to join peace talks, it must first stabilize the front and rebuild its forces enough to be able to conduct offensives,” says Muzyka.

Talk of how to end the conflict will now go into overdrive with Donald Trump’s election triumph. Trump has previously said he could end the war in 24 hours and in September he declared: “I think it’s in the US’ best interest to get this war finished and just get it done.”
One option favored by his vice president-elect, JD Vance, is to freeze the conflict on its current lines with a heavily fortified demilitarized zone to deter future Russian aggression. Along a poorly defined front line hundreds of miles long, that would be a daunting and perhaps impossible task.
It would reward the Kremlin with control of territories already seized. Moscow would also demand guarantees of Ukraine’s neutrality or at least the indefinite suspension of its drive to join NATO.
Even if on the backfoot, this would be impossible for President Volodymyr Zelensky to swallow without guarantees of Ukraine’s future security. And after the sacrifices of the past 1,000 days, it would also be unpalatable to many Ukrainians.
Chumak, the Supreme Court judge, insisted to CNN: “Our mood is patriotic, it hasn’t changed, we are ready to go all the way.”

With the reelection of Donald Trump, Ukraine may soon have to adjust to a dramatic reduction in US support that could have a decisive impact on the war with Russia.
Throughout his campaign, the Republican president-elect and his running mate, JD Vance, have cast strong doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv as the war drags on more than two and half years after Russian forces invaded. Moreover, Trump has made comments that suggest the US could pressure Ukraine into an uneasy truce with Russia.

Trump will win second term, CNN projects, in historic comeback after losing four years ago
Trump’s victory comes at a precarious moment in the conflict for Kyiv. Russia has steadily been making gains in the eastern Donbas region, which Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to capture in full.
Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said in a statement on Telegram on Saturday that the situation on the front line “remains difficult” and that certain areas “require constant renewal of resources of Ukrainian units.”
Meanwhile, Russia is understood to be bolstering its manpower with North Korean forces. As many as 10,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, US officials have warned.
Under the Biden administration, the US has provided tens of billions of dollars in aid to Ukraine, in the form of both weapons and budget assistance. The administration plans to continue to surge as much support as possible to Kyiv before Trump takes office.

Trump has repeatedly praised Putin – and repeatedly criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he has a complicated history. Trump’s efforts to leverage US military aid to Ukraine to force Zelensky to investigate the former president’s political rivals were the key focus of Trump’s first impeachment in 2019.
Zelensky congratulated Trump on Wednesday and said he appreciates Trump’s commitment to “peace through strength.”
“We look forward to an era of a strong United States of America under President Trump’s decisive leadership. We rely on continued strong bipartisan support for Ukraine in the United States,” Zelensky wrote in a social media post. “We are interested in developing mutually beneficial political and economic cooperation that will benefit both of our nations.”
Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Ukraine-Russia war would not have started if he had been president. He has also vowed to end the war, sometimes even claiming he would stop the years-long conflict before taking office. In July, he said he could settle the conflict in one day.
In his September presidential debate against Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump refused to say he was committed to Ukraine defeating Russia. Later that month, he suggested that Ukraine should have “given up a little bit” to Moscow, saying at a campaign event that “any deal, even the worst deal, would have been better than what we have right now.”
“If they made a bad deal, it would have been much better. They would have given up a little a bit and everybody would be living,” Trump said.
Just days after those comments, when Trump met with Zelensky in New York City, he stressed that he would work to get a good deal for “both sides.”
“We have a very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin. And I think if we win, we’re going to get it resolved very quickly,” Trump said.
“I think long before I, before January 20, before I would take the presidency – it’s January 20 – but long before that, I think that we can work out something that’s good for both sides. It’s time,” he added.

Zelensky has drawn up a “victory plan,” and has said Ukraine is not opposed to negotiations, but they must be from “a position of strength.” At a press conference in late October, the Ukrainian president said that “Trump talks a lot, but I didn’t hear him say he would reduce support for Ukraine.”
Zelensky said Wednesday that in their September meeting, he and Trump “discussed in detail the Ukraine-U.S. strategic partnership, the Victory Plan, and ways to put an end to Russian aggression against Ukraine.”
Still, in an interview with South Korea’s KBS, Zelensky acknowledged that “the next US president may strengthen or weaken support for Ukraine.”
“If that support weakens, Russia will seize more territory, it would prevent us from winning this war. That is the reality. Our stance isn’t about territorial compromises but exploring potential diplomatic paths that rely on the US maintaining its commitment. A genuine desire from the United States to end this war swiftly is crucial,” he said.
Ahead of the election, the US and its allies sought ways to “Trump-proof” that support. Earlier this year, NATO announced it would establish a mission to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine – an effort that has been largely led by the US. The Biden administration put forward $20 billion of the G7’s $50 billion loan package to Ukraine, which is also funded by frozen Russian assets.

 — 
As Moldova’s pro-EU president Maia Sandu celebrated victory in the early hours of Monday morning, in an election campaign she claimed involved “unprecedented” interference by Moscow, pro-Kremlin voices in Russia turned to the next page in their playbook: casting doubt on the result.
Sandu narrowly won a second presidential term in Sunday’s runoff vote, beating former prosecutor Alexandr Stoianoglu. According to Moldova’s Central election commission, with 100% of votes counted, Sandu had 55% of the total.
Konstantin Kosachev, deputy speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament, lamented the “disgraceful organization” of the election in a post on Telegram Monday, claiming the opportunity to vote overseas was “exclusively” provided to those who supported “one candidate” (implying Moldova provided more opportunities to vote to the diaspora in European countries, who typically favor Sandu, than to Moldovan citizens in Russia, who may have favored her opponent, who had promised friendlier ties to Moscow).
Another senior Russian senator, Andrey Klishas, took a similar line, suggesting Moldova had actively falsified the diaspora vote, which proved decisive in Sandu’s victory. “You count the votes, understand how many are lacking from the ‘correct’ candidate, and bring in the necessary number from overseas polling stations,” he wrote on Telegram Monday.
The Kremlin has officially denied accusations by Moldova that it orchestrated and funded a widespread interference campaign ranging from disinformation and cyber attacks to simple vote-buying to try to influence not only the presidential election but a referendum on October 20 on whether to enshrine Moldova’s intention to join the European Union in its constitution. That referendum secured a “yes” vote with a less than 1% margin.
And yet Moscow had a lot to gain from installing a Russia sympathizer in Chisinau and upending Moldova’s path to EU membership.

Russia already has a small military presence in Transnistria, an unrecognized breakaway republic in Moldova that borders Ukraine. Geographically, that region offers a potential staging ground for Russian attacks on Ukraine. But the concern for Moldova is that Russian intentions go beyond Ukraine.
In February, Transnistria appealed to Moscow for “protection” from what they claimed were threats from Moldovan authorities, echoing Russian claims of a similar appeal from Ukraine’s Donbas region, which Moscow used as part of its justification for its full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Another region in Moldova’s south, Gagauzia, is also keen to build closer ties with Moscow. Its leader, a regular visitor to Russia, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in March.
In his congratulatory note to Sandu Monday, US President Joe Biden declared “Russia failed” in its attempt to undermine Moldova’s democracy. But both the tight victory for Sandu and Moldova’s electoral calendar in the year ahead offer clear incentives for Moscow to keep up the pressure.
News coverage in Russia is already emphasizing the fact that Sandu narrowly lost the election within Moldova but secured victory due to an unprecedented turnout by Moldova’s large expat population — more than 80% of which voted for her.
In her victory speech, Sandu acknowledged the divisions in the country, promising to be “the president for all of you.”
She now has less than a year to address those divisions before parliamentary elections next summer, which many fear could be another target for Moscow.

Lithuania’s foreign ministry wrote on X Monday, “With parliamentary elections around the corner, (the) EU should do its best to help Moldova investigate all of Russia’s malign interference & bring its perpetrators to justice.”
Recent parliamentary elections in Georgia, where the pro-Russian Georgian Dream party secured victory amid widespread reports of Russian interference, may have also given Moscow a taste of success.
Meanwhile, Ukraine is breathing a sigh of relief at the results of Moldova’s election.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky immediately called to congratulate Sandu, vowing to strengthen the two country’s partnership.
And yet, Moldova looks at Ukraine with growing trepidation. Russia is currently advancing in the east in what Ukraine’s commander-in-chief described as “one of the most powerful Russian offensives since the start of the war.”
Attacks on Odesa and Ukraine’s Danube ports have already brought the war far too close for comfort for Chisinau.

Russia has steadily been making gains in the eastern Donbas region, which Russia’s President Vladimir Putin aims to capture in full. Reuters, citing open source data, reported that Russia has been advancing at its fastest pace in at least a year.

Kyiv’s forces, he said, are “holding back one of the most powerful Russian offensives since the beginning of the full-scale invasion.”
Over the weekend, Russia claimed the capture of two settlements in the Donetsk region - Kurakhivka and Vyshneve. Ukrainian officials have not confirmed either claim.
Vyshneve is close to Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the east and a major target of the Russian offensive.
Meanwhile Russian drone attacks continue, with Ukraine bracing for what could be a difficult winter with energy infrastructure already badly hit.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia launched over 50 drone attacks at Ukraine overnight into Sunday. Over the past week, Russia has dropped more than 900 bombs on Ukraine, and launched about 30 missiles and nearly 500 Shahed drones in various regions of Ukraine, he added.
Most of the strikes were directed against civilian objects and critical infrastructure, the statement said.
Zelensky spent recent weeks trying to drum up additional support but has so far been unable to secure consent to fire deeper into Russia.
He repeated his plea for Western aid, adding in the statement that “all of these strikes would not have been possible if we had sufficient support from the world.”
Zelensky warned that “Russia is gradually increasing this activity” and added that Moscow still has the ability to “use Western components for this purpose.”
“All this is supplied to Russia from abroad,” Zelensky continued. “And unfortunately, it comes from companies in China, Europe, and America - a lot of micro-contributions to the constant Russian terror.”

If elected, Kamala Harris is expected to largely continue the supportive policies of the Biden administration. Taking a drastically different position, Donald Trump has suggested he will end support for Kyiv’s war effort and claimed he could settle the war “in one day.”

Russia is watching US policy like a hawk.
That was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s message to reporters last week in Kyiv as he answered a question about Moscow’s willingness to negotiate. “It depends on the elections in the United States,” he said.
If elected, Kamala Harris is expected to largely continue the policies of the Biden administration, which have been supportive of Ukraine despite some friction points, like the use of Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia.
Taking a drastically different position, Donald Trump has suggested he will end support for Kyiv’s war effort and claimed he could settle the war “in one day.” Terms of a peace plan floated by his vice-presidential nominee JD Vance are strikingly similar to Putin’s wish list.
American policy is at a crossroads, but that won’t necessarily translate to a turning point in peace negotiations, analysts say.
That’s because nothing suggests Russia is ready to come to the table, regardless of who ends up in the White House.

US says it expects North Korean troops to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days
“What [Trump] thinks he can do, what leverage he has, is unclear at this point – but I don’t think it’s a quick process,” said Thomas Graham, a Russian foreign policy expert and distinguished fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
A reduction in US aid spending could very well translate to changes on the battlefield, though, experts say.
With either potential president, Putin will be looking to exploit what he sees as political dysfunction in the United States, as well as “cracks in Western unity,” Graham told CNN.
Those cracks could come in the form of a Trump administration reducing US aid and taking a lesser role in NATO, or a split US Congress, among other factors. Financial pressures on European allies also play a role, as well as rifts in NATO, with pro-Russian leaderships in member states such as Hungary and Slovakia.
“Absent Western unity, absent a clear demonstration that the West and Ukraine have a common vision of what they’re trying to achieve… Putin has no reason to reconsider what he is doing in Ukraine at this point,” Graham added.
The scope of the war is also too large for a simple negotiation between Moscow and Kyiv, experts say. They argue it’s a much broader conflict between Russia and the West.
For Putin, “Ukraine is just a means to an end, and the end is to further limit US influence in international affairs,” said John Lough, an associate fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London think tank Chatham House.
“When [Trump’s] advisers explain to him what’s really going on here and the fact that China has played a key role in sustaining Russia’s ability to continue fighting this war… he may feel suddenly very strongly that he’s not so well disposed to Putin,” Lough said, adding that Beijing will perceive any concessions “as a further indication of US weakness.”
That goes against Trump’s tough rhetoric on the threat posed by China.
Attritional war playing into Putin’s hands
Ukraine is already outmanned, and Putin appears ready to accept a high number of casualties. More than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded, according to NATO.
“The enemy is increasing its troops to drive the Ukrainian Armed Forces out of the Kursk region at any cost,” said Oleh Shiryaev, commander of the 225th Separate Assault Battalion that is fighting in Ukraine’s surprise incursion across the Russian border. “Russia’s main element in this war is the number of its troops – these are meaty assaults and offensive actions. They do this in all parts of the frontline.”

In Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, another commander with the Security Service of Ukraine said, “By sending a large number of personnel into battle as cannon fodder, they are trying to gain a foothold in the grey areas of the front.” The officer, who asked to be named only by his call sign “Bankir,” which means accountant, told CNN that a complex system of fortifications in Zaporizhzhia is helping Ukraine defend the frontline.
But Kyiv knows that’s not enough. On Wednesday, Ukraine’s Parliament voted to extend martial law and the draft for an additional 90 days. There are plans to call up an additional 160,000 people, the National Security Council announced.
The Ukrainian servicemen who spoke to CNN said Russia has other advantages too, like countless drones, expensive aircraft and more vehicles that enable fighting during the muddy fall and winter.
Ukraine needs support for both its infantry and its equipment coffers, servicemen said.
“We have ammunition, but as artillerymen say, there is never enough,” said 15th Brigade National Guard Spokesman Vitaliy Milovidov, who is fighting in the eastern Donetsk region, where Russian forces continue to make incremental gains.
If a potential Trump administration cuts US aid, Ukraine would become increasingly outgunned.
European nations are scrambling to increase ammunition production for Ukraine to prevent backsliding, in the event that US support drops off.
But even if US policy continues along the current trajectory, Kyiv’s Western allies don’t appear willing to send the level of resources needed to make major battlefield gains.

“My hunch is that this is going to continue, at a lower intensity possibly, but for a long time,” Chatham House’s Lough added. “A Harris administration certainly wouldn’t sell out the Ukrainians, but it would really test their Ukrainian resolve and whether they are prepared to continue to fight this attritional war.”
That’s why Putin’s strategy also appears aimed at demoralizing Ukraine’s population.
Russia has repeatedly attacked civilians and civilian infrastructure. It has also hammered Ukraine’s energy grid, which exacerbates problems for everyday Ukrainians who will face a winter marred by lack of heating and water.
Analysts say the Ukrainian population is certainly exhausted, but they too don’t appear ready to settle in any way. After the mass killings of civilians in Bucha and Mariupol, the brutal treatment of Ukrainian prisoners in Russian custody, and the forcible deportation of Ukrainian children by the Russian state, they know the brutal realities of Russian occupation.
Zelensky, meanwhile, continues to call for support from both parties.

 — 
As many as 8,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, top US officials announced Thursday.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking alongside Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and their South Korean counterparts in Washington, said the troops have been trained “in artillery, UAVs, basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in frontline operations.”
Although the US has not yet seen the troops engaged in the actual fighting, Blinken warned Thursday that “should these troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.”
The 8,000 North Korean troops now in Kursk represent a majority of the 10,000 the US says were deployed to Russia. The announcement of their impending use in combat comes as the US and its allies weigh how to respond to the escalating military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang.
“We are consulting closely with our allies and partners in other countries in the region on these reckless developments and on our response,” Austin said at Thursday’s press conference. The US will announce additional military support to Ukraine “in the coming days,” Blinken said.
Ukrainian forces have held territory in Kursk since launching a surprise incursion into the Russian border region in August. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called for South Korea to take a more active role in supporting Kyiv, warned Thursday that when the North Korean troops are deployed, “they will be pushed forward, sustaining heavy losses, as Russia tries to minimize its own troop mobilization.”
Asked if he believed Ukraine would be able to hold its territory in Kursk with the additional North Korean forces deployed to the region, Austin said the “answer is yes.”
Russian troops have suffered heavy losses throughout the more than two years of full-scale war against Ukraine. The US defense secretary noted Thursday that the number of North Korean troops sent to Kursk “pales in comparison” to the number of casualties Russia sees regularly.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday praised what he called “very close contacts” with the North Korean military and intelligence services.
“This helps to solve very important tasks for the security of our and your citizens,” Lavrov said at the start of a meeting with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui.
The meeting in Moscow marked the sixth time the Russian and North Korean foreign ministers are meeting this year, according to Lavrov.
On Thursday, Blinken and Austin redoubled their calls for China to use its influence with North Korea to stem its “provocative actions.”
“We’ve had communications with China – in fact, we had a robust conversation just this week, and I think they know well the concerns that we have and the expectations that, both in word and deed, they’ll use the influence that they have to work to curb these activities,” the top US diplomat said. He added that Beijing should be concerned by the deepening cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow.
“We’re very focused on and concerned about what Russia might be doing in order to enhance the (North Korean) capacities, its military capacity – that too should be a real concern to China, because it’s profoundly destabilizing in the region,” Blinken noted.
“I’m surprised by China’s silence” on North Korea’s support for Russia, Zelensky said in an interview with South Korea’s KBS. “I can’t say that China is on our side, but as a regional security guarantor, its silence is striking.”

180,Ukraine,2024,10,"North Korea likely to ask for nuclear technology from Russia in exchange for troops, South Korea says",Natasha Bertrand,"CNN
 — 
North Korea is “very likely to ask” Moscow for advanced technology related to nuclear weapons in exchange for deploying troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine, South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun said at the Pentagon on Wednesday.
North Korea will likely request Russian technology transfers relating to tactical nuclear weapons, the advancement of North Korean intercontinental ballistic missiles, reconnaissance satellites and nuclear submarines, Kim said, speaking through a translator alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.
The arrangement would mirror one Russia has with Iran, in which Moscow has been sharing technology on nuclear issues with Tehran in exchange for weapons and military support for the war in Ukraine, the White House said in September.
Kim said that, ultimately, he did not believe North Korea deploying troops to help Russia would increase “the possibility of war breaking out on the Korean peninsula” but that it could result in “the escalation of the security threats on the Korean peninsula.”
South Korea has been raising alarms about North Korea’s troop deployment to Russia for weeks and briefed NATO allies on the intelligence about the troop movements on Monday. A source familiar with the matter said that South Korea has dramatically increased its intelligence sharing with the alliance in recent weeks as their concerns have grown about the North Korean movements.
The US independently confirmed for the first time last week that thousands of North Korean troops had been sent to Russia for military training. At first, the US said only 3,000 were there but revised that number this week to 10,000. South Korea says 13,000 have been deployed.
A small number of North Korean troops are already in Ukraine, CNN reported on Tuesday, and officials are growing increasingly concerned that the forces will enter into combat alongside Russian troops.
“The evidence now suggests that North Korea has sent around 10,000 soldiers to train in eastern Russia,” Austin said on Wednesday. “Some of these DPRK troops have already moved closer to Ukraine, and we’re seeing them outfitted with Russian uniforms and provided with Russian equipment.”
Asked what would happen if North Korean troops are killed with American-made weapons provided to Ukraine, Austin said that “those kinds of things will happen” if the North Koreans join the Russians in the war.
“If the DPRK soldiers are fighting alongside Russian soldiers in this conflict and attacking Ukrainian soldiers, Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend themselves, and they will do that with the weapons that we provided and others have provided,” Austin said. “If they are fighting alongside Russian soldiers, they are co-belligerents, and you have every reason to believe that those kinds of things will happen, that they will be killed and wounded as a result of battle.”
It is still unclear how helpful the North Koreans will be to the Russians on the battlefield. Many of the troops deployed are special forces, CNN reported on Tuesday, but North Korea’s military has not fought in an actual war for over 70 years. Intelligence officials believe the North Korean government sent them in large part so they could gain combat experience.
Kim, the South Korean defense minister, did not respond directly when asked on Wednesday whether South Korea will begin providing military aid to the Ukrainians to help counter the North Koreans, which would be at odds with the South Koreans’ longstanding policy of not arming countries at war.
But he did say that South Korean military analysts could be deployed to observe the North Koreans fighting the Russians to gain more insight into North Korea’s military readiness.
“I believe it could serve as a great opportunity for our analysis team or observer to learn the movements or trends of the North Korean troops,” Kim said. “I believe if we can collect such information diligently and then utilize it for our future safety of and stability of our country, I believe it can serve as an opportunity for us to provide better protection toward the people of Republic of Korea.”
“I believe it is an obvious task that our military should play to send observers and analysis team to the Russia-Ukraine war,” he added. “And I would even say that if we don’t send our observers or analysis team, it would mean that we are not faithfully doing our jobs.”

181,Ukraine,2024,10,Russia claims control of key town of Selydove in Ukraine’s Donetsk region,Daria Tarasova-Markina,"Kyiv, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Tuesday it had taken the Ukrainian town of Selydove, southeast of the key city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region.
Russian forces have been advancing on Selydove in the last several weeks, according to frontline reports. It’s part of Russia’s ongoing assault and incremental territorial gains in eastern Ukraine.
Selydove was an important staging area for Ukraine’s defenses and a key foothold to prevent Russia’s advance toward Pokrovsk.
Ukrainian authorities have not yet commented on Russia’s claims of control.
On Sunday, a spokesman for a Ukrainian national guard brigade fighting in Selydove told CNN the town had been “constantly attacked from several directions” for a week.
“[Russia] continues to assault with very large troop numbers. They used reserves from the north of the frontline’s Pokrovsk section to increase pressure on Selydove,” 15th brigade national guard spokesman Vitaliy Milovidov said.
“At the same time, the enemy is not destroying the city’s infrastructure,” he added. “Most likely, they want to keep the town as a foothold for themselves in the future. Selydove is a large town where you can accommodate a large number of people and hide equipment.”
Video released by Russian state media TASS on Tuesday reportedly shows troops raising the Russian flag in Selydove.
Russia also continued aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities overnight into Tuesday.
At least nine Ukrainian people were killed and 46 injured across the country as Russian forces attacked the cities of Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih and the capital Kyiv. In the Odesa region, a 71-year-old man was killed by falling debris following an intercepted Russian missile strike launched by a fighter jet from the Black Sea.

182,Isreal,2024,11,FBI arrests alleged leaker of US intelligence documents related to Israel’s attack plans against Iran,Hannah Rabinowitz,"CNN
 — 
The Justice Department has charged a man for allegedly leaking highly classified US intelligence about Israel’s plans for retaliation against Iran, according to court documents and a person familiar with the case.
Asif W. Rahman was indicted last Thursday for willfully retaining and transmitting national defense information, according to court documents. He was arrested Tuesday in Cambodia and will first appear in court in Guam, though the department has asked a federal judge to move him to Virginia to stand trial.
Rahman was employed by the CIA, according to a person familiar with his employment. Court documents indicate he was employed by the US government.
Rahman held a top secret security clearance and could access sensitive compartmentalized information.
The New York Times first reported Rahman’s indictment.
The documents were posted by a Telegram account in mid-October called “Middle East Spectator.” They are marked top secret and have markings indicating they are meant to be seen only by the US and its “Five Eyes” allies — Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.
CNN previously reported that one of the documents, which says it was compiled by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, discussed a plan involving Israel moving munitions. The other, which says it is sourced to the National Security Agency, outlines Israeli Air Force exercises involving air-to-surface missiles.
One of the documents also suggests something that Israel has always declined to confirm publicly: that the country has nuclear weapons. The document says the US has not seen any indications that Israel plans to use a nuclear weapon against Iran.

183,Isreal,2024,11,UN sounds alarm at Israel’s ‘severe violations’ at key buffer zone with Syria,Nadeen Ebrahim,"CNN
 — 
The United Nations has accused Israel of “severe violations” of a 50-year-old agreement with Syria, saying it has engaged in “engineering groundwork activities” that encroach on a key buffer zone in the Golan Heights.
“Violations of the 1974 Disengagement Agreement have occurred where engineering works have encroached into the AoS (the area of separation),” the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF), which has maintained the ceasefire between Israel and Syria since 1974, said in a statement Tuesday.
Satellite imagery from Planet Labs and the European Space Agency shows that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been conducting excavation activity near Jubata Al Khashab, Syria since mid-August. A large earthen berm, roughly 40 feet (12 meters) wide, is being dug.
The trench now stretches almost five miles (eight kilometers).
Work on extending the trench even further is continuing, according to recent satellite imagery. In a Planet Labs image taken on November 5, an excavator and other vehicles can be seen working.
The “extensive engineering groundwork activities” run along the so-called Alpha Line that separates Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, UNDOF said, adding that the construction began in July and includes the use of “excavators and other earth-moving equipment with protection from armored vehicles and soldiers.” Main battle tanks of the IDF were also occasionally present in the demilitarized zone, violating the 1974 agreement.
The UN peacekeeping mission said it has “repeatedly engaged with the IDF to protest the construction” work, which has worried Syrian authorities, who have also “strongly protested.”
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
Breaching the buffer zone
UNDOF warned on Tuesday that Israel’s “severe violations” at the buffer zone “have the potential to increase tensions in the area.”
The peacekeeping force and its mandate were born out of a US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Syria in May 1974, following months of fighting in a war launched by Egyptian and Syrian forces against Israel in October 1973.
The agreement created a buffer zone, as well as two equal zones of limited forces and armaments on both sides of the area. While Israel and Syria remain formally at war, this agreement has largely maintained peace with the help of the UN peacekeeping mission in the Golan.
For Israel, the Golan Heights is a strategic plateau seized from Syria during the Six-Day War in 1967, and formally annexed in 1981. The hilly landscape, which spans some 500 square miles, is home to some 20,000 Arab Druze and about 25,000 Jewish Israelis spread across more than 30 settlements.

It also shares a border with Jordan and Lebanon, where Israel has been waging a war against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group.
Israel sees the Golan Heights as key to its national security interests and says it needs to control the region to fend off threats from Syria and Iranian proxy groups there.
On Tuesday, UNDOF said that upon engaging Israel about the violations, the Israeli side said the construction is “being carried out for defensive purpose to prevent unauthorized crossing and violations by civilians” along the Alpha Line on the Israeli side.
Navvar Saban, a researcher at the Harmoon Center for Contemporary Studies who specializes in Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq, said Israeli activities in the Golan are likely for defensive purposes, as the IDF seeks to enhance its existing structures.
RELATED ARTICLE
What is the Golan Heights and who are the Druze?
“This can be considered a precautionary move from the Israeli side for any possible increased operations from Hezbollah militias in that area,” Saban told CNN.
Israel has for months been conducting strikes inside Syria, saying it is targeting Iranian or Hezbollah interests. In April, following an Israeli strike on what Tehran said was a diplomatic building in Damascus, Iran responded by launching a barrage of missiles and drones directly at Israel.
In July, tensions between Israel and Hezbollah spiked after a deadly rocket attack hit a soccer field in the Arab town of Majdal Shams in the Golan, killing at least 12 children. Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, which the Lebanese group denied.
Saban said that Hezbollah is unlikely to try and trigger an Israeli military offensive from the Golan, however.
“Syria is the only remaining backdoor for Hezbollah,” he told CNN, adding that Hezbollah has not operated in the area against Israel the way it has from southern Lebanon. The group cannot handle the “shock” of another front from the Israelis, he said.
Israel has in recent months accused Syria of violating the 1974 agreement. In July, the IDF said it struck Syrian military infrastructure in retaliation for alleged breaches. “The IDF holds the Syrian military responsible for all activities occurring within its territory and will not allow any attempts to violate Israeli sovereignty,” the Israeli military said.

184,Isreal,2024,11,Saudi crown prince accuses Israel of committing ‘collective genocide’ in Gaza,Mostafa Salem,"CNN
 — 
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has accused Israel of carrying out “collective genocide” in Gaza, in some of his strongest criticism of the country since the war began last year.
During a gathering of leaders of Islamic nations hosted by Saudi Arabia in Riyadh on Monday, the country’s de facto leader said: “The Kingdom reiterates its condemnation and absolute refusal of the collective genocide committed by Israel against the brotherly Palestinian people.”
More than 43,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its attacks on the enclave last year. On Tuesday, at least 30 people were killed in Gaza city and northern Gaza, with many more still under the rubble, according to the spokesperson for Gaza’s Civil Defense, Mahmoud Basal. CNN has asked the Israeli military for comment.
Last year the kingdom was in the process of negotiating a historic normalization agreement with Israel but recently said that was “off the table” without Palestinian statehood, a demand rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
The Saudi crown prince, widely known by his initials MBS, also defended Iran – a stark contrast to his comments in 2017 comparing the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to Adolf Hitler.
RELATED ARTICLE
Here’s what’s at stake in the Middle East under Trump’s second term
MBS urged the international community to “compel Israel to respect Iran’s sovereignty and not to attack (Iranian) territories.” Riyadh and Tehran repaired ties last year after decades of animosity over regional influence.
With no solution in sight for the regional conflicts and amid a stalled normalization process with Israel, Saudi Arabia has changed its messaging over the past year from condemnations to publicly accusing Israel of genocide while urging more international protection for Iran.
Iran sent its First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref to Monday’s Riyadh conference, who in his speech mourned the deaths of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar. Saudi Arabia strongly opposes Iran-backed militias such as Hezbollah and Hamas.
Others attending the high-level meeting included Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati, Jordan’s King Abdullah II and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

Presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Bashar al-Assad of Syria, who were also at the meeting, remain embroiled in an ongoing conflict over Turkey’s military operations in northern Syria and its support for rebel groups.
The stated goal of Monday’s meeting was “unifying positions” and “exerting pressure” on the international community to take steps to end the “ongoing attacks and establish lasting peace,” in the region, Saudi’s governmental state agency said.
Unifying in the wake of the US election
Experts say MBS gathered regional allies and old foes to exhibit his strength in unifying Islamic nations ahead of US President-elect Donald Trump assuming office.
Throughout his 2024 campaign, Trump had not specified how he would approach the Israel-Hamas war, or how his policies would differ from those of his predecessor Joe Biden. In April, Trump said that Israel needs to “finish what they started” and “get it over with fast,” noting that it was “losing the PR war” because of the images coming out of Gaza.
But the incoming US president would likely seek to reinstate the sanctions regimes on Tehran to “isolate Iran diplomatically” and “weaken it economically,” Brian Hook, who was Trump’s Iran envoy during his first administration, told CNN’s Becky Anderson last week.
Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida, Trump’s pick for national security adviser, and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who sources say is likely to be his selection for secretary of state, have hardline policies on Iran.
“He has a lot of friendships in the region with leaders. Those friendships, I think, are only going to deepen and I think the cooperation and the bonds of friendship, security and commerce are all going to be much better in the coming years,” Hook said of Trump.
Saudi Arabia, which had helped Trump in his policy of Iranian containment during his first term, is wary this time of supporting a “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, due to skepticism of US willingness to protect the kingdom in the face of an Iranian attack, analysts say.
Instead, the kingdom has been expanding its relationship with Iran. This week, MBS spoke with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, welcomed his vice president in Riyadh and dispatched the Saudi army chief of staff to Tehran for meetings with his Iranian counterpart.
The kingdom is trying to make sure it’s staying out of any war that involves the US, Israel and Iran because of domestic anger against Israel from their own populations but also because of the effectiveness of Iranian ballistic missiles, executive vice president of the Washington, DC-based Quincy Institute Trita Parsi said.
There are several political risks to normalizing relations with Israel today, said Hussein Ibish, a senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. “With normalization Saudi Arabia recognizes that it will be risking possible internal political dissent, a regional Arab leadership role and a global Islamic leadership role that is very contested,” Ibish said.
“The message from Riyadh is we want to play ball, but you have to give us something, and not just on Palestine, on Iran too … we’re not going to do a deal with the Israelis if you don’t make it worth our while,” Ibish said.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/middleeast/saudi-mbs-accuses-israel-genocide-gaza-intl/index.html
185,Isreal,2024,11,Trump picks Mike Huckabee to serve as US ambassador to Israel,Kit Maher,"Washington
CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he has nominated former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to serve as United States ambassador to Israel, a strong defender of Israel who once argued that there was “no such thing as a Palestinian.”
“Mike has been a great public servant, Governor, and Leader in Faith for many years. He loves Israel, and the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him. Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East!” Trump said in a statement.
Huckabee’s daughter, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, served as Trump’s press secretary during his first administration.
Huckabee has been staunchly pro-Israeli throughout his career – including on what he says is the country’s claims to the West Bank.
On Wednesday he said it was “of course” possible that the US would back the Israeli government if it were to try and annex the Israeli-occupied territory.
In an interview on Israeli Army Radio, Huckabee was asked whether the Trump administration would support annexation in the West Bank, known in Israel as applying “sovereignty.”
“Well of course,” Huckabee said. “I won’t make the policy, I will carry out the policy of the president. But he has already demonstrated in his first term that there’s never been an American president that has been more helpful in securing an understanding of the sovereignty of Israel.”
“From the moving of the embassy, recognition of the Golan Heights and Jerusalem as the capital. No one has done more than President Trump. And I fully expect that that will continue.”
Israel has occupied the West Bank since seizing the territory from Jordan in 1967. In the decades since, it has expanded Jewish settlements in the area, which are considered illegal under international law, despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s. Around half a million Israelis live in West Bank settlements.
RELATED ARTICLE
Mike Huckabee once said that ‘there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian’
His selection will come as a welcome culmination of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s long mission to shore up ties to American evangelicals.
Huckabee has spent ample time in Israel, and he led a tour in the country for the company Senior Adult Travel Inc. as recently as May, according to the company’s website.
In a video obtained by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski during Huckabee’s 2015 run for president, Huckabee suggested that if a Palestinian state were to be created, it should be in neighboring countries like Egypt, Syria or Jordan, rather than within Israel’s borders.
“Basically, there really is no such thing as — I need to be careful about saying this, because people will really get upset — there’s really no such thing as a Palestinian,” Huckabee said at a 2008 campaign stop in Massachusetts while speaking to two Orthodox Jewish men. “There’s not.”
He’s been a supporter of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, including laying a cornerstone for a new neighborhood in one of the largest settlements, just east of Jerusalem, in 2017.
He told CNN’s Oren Lieberman at the time that he rejected the use of the word “settlements.”
“I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,” said Huckabee, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. “There are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria. There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighborhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation.”
Israeli officials welcome Trump’s pick
Israeli officials welcomed Trump’s choice of ambassador.
Far-right finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, who is pushing for the annexation of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, congratulated Huckabee in a post on X.
ANALYSIS
Trump’s emerging team of loyalists is primed for a fast start in his second term
Smotrich, who is in charge of the settlements, wrote of Huckabee, “As a consistent and loyal friend of the State of Israel and a supporter of the settlement enterprise in Judea and Samaria, who for many years fought for our state and our right to all parts of the Land of Israel, I have no doubt that we have won and together with him we will strengthen Israel’s security and strength and strengthen our hold in all its spaces.”
Newly appointed Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar called Huckabee a “longstanding friend of Israel” in a post on X and said he looks forward to working to “strengthen the bond between our peoples.”
Israel’s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, also congratulated Huckabee, saying, “I think he will be a great ambassador to Israel.” Dannon said Huckabee is “very familiar” with the facts on the ground and has been to Israel multiple times, including after the deadly October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks.
Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir also expressed his support. He posted Huckabee’s name to X, followed by emojis of the American flag, a heart and an Israeli flag.

Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday was his pick to serve as US ambassador to Israel, previously argued that there was “no such thing as a Palestinian.”
Huckabee, who has been a strong defender of Israel throughout his career, made the statement during his 2008 presidential campaign, asserting that Palestinian identity was “a political tool to try and force land away from Israel.”
In a video obtained by CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski during Huckabee’s 2015 run for president, Huckabee suggested that if a Palestinian state were to be created, it should be in neighboring countries like Egypt, Syria or Jordan, rather than within Israel’s borders.

In response to a question from one of the men about the possibility of a Palestinian state existing outside of Israel, Huckabee said he believed this was the preferable option.
“You have Arabs and Persians,” Huckabee continued at the 2008 appearance. “And there’s such complexity in that. But there’s really no such thing. That’s been a political tool to try and force land away from Israel.”
In the video, which was previously published by BuzzFeed, Huckabee added that he thought a Palestinian state could be made out of land in Egypt, Syria or Jordan.
“My point is, if that’s the issue, if it’s real estate, if you look at a map, and say here is how much Israel has and here is how much the Arab states hold, there is plenty of land,” he said.
Huckabee reiterated that point during a 2015 interview on Israeli TV, in which he argued that a two-state solution was “irrational and unworkable” and said “there’s plenty of land” outside of Israel in the “rest of the world” for a Palestinian state.

187,Isreal,2024,11,"US has not assessed Israel is violating law on Gaza aid, will not change policy despite humanitarian groups’ findings",Jennifer Hansler,"Washington
CNN
 — 
The Biden administration has not assessed that Israel is in violation of US law and will not change its policy at this time, a State Department spokesperson said Tuesday on the US-mandated 30-day deadline for the Netanyahu government to take specific steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
The US statement comes in sharp contrast to the findings of humanitarian aid organizations, who say that “the humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated to its worst point since the war began in October 2023.” The situation in northern Gaza in particular has been described as “apocalyptic,” with areas at “imminent” risk of famine.
Last month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin set a 30-day deadline for the Israeli government to take action on more than a dozen concrete measures to improve the “deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza.”
On Tuesday, a group of eight humanitarian aid organizations jointly said the Israeli government “not only failed to meet the U.S. criteria that would indicate support to the humanitarian response, but concurrently took actions that dramatically worsened the situation on the ground, particularly in northern Gaza.”
Blinken and Austin in their letter warned that a “failure to demonstrate a sustained commitment to implementing and maintaining these measures may have implications for US policy” under a Biden administration national security memorandum as well as US law. Section 620I of the US Foreign Assistance Act requires the US to halt security assistance to governments who restrict US humanitarian aid.
“We, at this time, have not made an assessment that the Israelis are in violation of US law,” State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said Tuesday.
Patel said that the Israeli government has taken some of the measures outlined in the letter, and argued that they may not have happened without US pressure.
“We’ve seen some progress being made,” he said at a press briefing. “We would like to see some more changes happen.”
“Most importantly, we are going to continue to watch how these steps that they’ve taken, how they are being implemented, how they can be continued to be expanded on, and through that, we’re going to continue to assess their compliance with US law.”
An Israeli official told CNN earlier on Tuesday that the government has been working to provide humanitarian aid throughout the past year, and “responded positively to most American requests, many of which were already underway regardless.”
‘Worst point since the war began’
However, according to the aid organizations, “the humanitarian situation in Gaza has deteriorated to its worst point since the war began in October 2023.”
There was “non-compliance, significant delays, or backtracking” on 15 of the measures outlined in the Blinken and Austin letter, according to the aid organization’s joint scorecard released Tuesday. There was only “partial or inconsistent implementation” on four of them. None of the measures saw “full or significant progress.”
The scorecard was compiled by Anera, CARE International, MedGlobal, Mercy Corps, Norwegian Refugee Council, Oxfam, Refugees International, and Save the Children. It is “based on the observations and experience of humanitarian organizations on the ground and on available public data and secondary sources.”
The measures that were completely unmet, according to the scorecard, included allowing a minimum of 350 trucks of humanitarian aid per day to enter Gaza and reinstating a minimum of 50-100 commercial trucks per day.
“It’s the sort of lethal combo of no humanitarian assistance and no commercial assistance getting in that is, for the past 30 days, accelerating the deterioration, and that’s a real problem,” said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, the vice president of global policy and advocacy at Mercy Corps.
“If you’re not having movement on one of those two, then it means that people are not going to have anything to eat. It’s just a very basic equation, right? Nothing to buy, nothing being given, and there’s obviously nothing being really grown or fished or anything locally, and not to mention it wouldn’t ever sustain a population of 2 million,” she told CNN.
They are now receiving reports that “people are not just skipping meals anymore; they’re having a meal once every couple of days, and it’s mostly canned stuff,” she said.
“There’s no fresh food,” Phillips-Barrasso said.
The Israeli government also failed to institute “adequate humanitarian pauses” to allow for humanitarian activities, to rescind “evacuation orders when there is no operational need,” to ensure continuous humanitarian access to northern Gaza, or enhance security for humanitarian sites and movements, according to the scorecard.
According to Israeli authorities and local Palestinian journalists, some humanitarian aid has been delivered to northern Gaza’s Beit Hanoun area in recent days – but many displaced Palestinians there were forced out of their shelters by airstrikes and warnings from the Israeli military to head south before they could receive the aid.
“Israeli forces repeatedly attacked humanitarian sites and frontline responders during the 30-day period,” the scorecard said. “At least 14 aid workers have been killed since October 3, including at least four documented during the 30-day period.”
Moreover, despite US warnings in the letter and elsewhere, the Israeli parliament voted to ban UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. The State Department spokesperson warned last month that the role UNRWA plays in Gaza “cannot be filled by anyone else.”
Calls to halt arms sales
On Tuesday, a group of US officials who resigned in protest at the Biden administration’s policy towards Israel and the war in Gaza called on the US government to halt weapons sales to Israel for violating laws on humanitarian aid.
“We are calling on President Biden to keep this 30-day promise. To uphold US law. To halt US weapons sales to Israel, to stop the spread of the conflict and look out for America,” members of the group said in a video.
“There is no provision in US or international law that allows extra time to starve people,” said former top State Department official Stacy Gilbert.
The humanitarian scorecard noted that “the effectiveness of international diplomatic efforts to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza hinges on the willingness of the United States and other countries to push Israel to comply with these priorities.”

188,Isreal,2024,11,Families of American hostages captured by Hamas turn to Donald Trump for new hope,MJ Lee,"Washington
CNN
 — 
The families of US hostages captured by Hamas on October 7, 2023, remain in agony, waiting for any sign that their loved ones might finally come home to them.
Now, more than a year into the Israel-Hamas conflict and on the heels of last week’s US presidential election, some of those families are turning to one man with renewed hope: President-elect Donald Trump.
Ruby Chen, whose son Itay was a 19-year-old soldier in the Israeli military when he was killed on October 7, is still waiting for the return of his son’s remains. Chen, along with family members of a handful of other dual US-Israeli hostages – some of whom have been confirmed dead – plan to meet with President Joe Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan at the White House Tuesday afternoon.
Chen told CNN on Tuesday that with Trump now poised to return to the White House for a second term, he is not alone in hoping that the next US president – who has famously marketed himself throughout his career as the ultimately dealmaker – might be able to accomplish what Biden has failed to thus far: Secure the return of the American hostages.
“He’s always been ‘America First,’” Chen said of Trump. “He cares about the topic of American hostages and now it’s time to see his recommitment to the topic, and have American hostages come out before January 20.”
Chen added that he would be glad to see a social media post from Trump about the US hostages in Gaza, which he would take as a serious indication of the president-elect’s dedication to the issue.
Speaking at the Republican National Convention over the summer, Trump said: “To the entire world, I tell you this: We want our hostages back. And they better be back before I assume office, or you will be paying a very big price.”
The Biden administration has been pushing for months for a ceasefire and hostages release deal in the Israel-Hamas war. Those talks are stalled.
The families of the American hostages have had numerous meetings with top American officials – Democrat and Republican – throughout the course of the Gaza conflict, as they have periodically visited Washington, DC, to advocate for the release of their loved ones. Those families have yet to meet with Trump or his running mate, JD Vance, according to Chen.
The meeting between the families and Sullivan comes as talks for a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas – a top priority for Biden’s remaining months in office - remain at a standstill. Qatar recently announced it had paused its role as a mediator for a ceasefire in Gaza due to a lack of willingness by the sides to reach an agreement.
“We continue to work to get a deal done as soon as possible to bring the hostages home to their families,” a White House official said, adding Sullivan has met frequently with the families throughout the past year.
In the wake of the election last week, the hostage families called on Trump to work with Biden to “secure the immediate release of the hostages and end this nightmare for the hostage families, Israel, and the civilians of Gaza.”
“The hostages cannot wait any longer,” they said. “They are depending on us and on Republican and Democratic leaders to seize this moment.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/hostage-families-israel-hamas-trump/index.html
189,Isreal,2024,11,Netanyahu’s aggressive strategy brings political success and a raft of scandal,Mick Krever,"Jerusalem
CNN
 — 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on a winning streak.
From a low point in the aftermath of Hamas’ October 7 attack, his poll numbers have rebounded. He fired his defense minister, Yoav Gallant, who long threatened his coalition and whose attempted dismissal last year led to massive protests. He has installed allies as foreign and defense ministers, meaning his governing coalition has never been more stable. He passed a law to dismantle the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, long derided by Israel. The White House will soon be home to Donald Trump, with whom Netanyahu has spoken three times in the past week.

Netanyahu rides wave of euphoria over assassinations as his political fortunes turn around
He is riding a wave of military success too: The leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah are dead. Gaza is decimated, and Israel controls the Lebanese border. (Rarely mentioned are the more than 43,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry there – the majority of whom the UN says are women and children.)
His victories have been achieved at least partially by a long-standing tactic: delay. He has refused to establish a national commission of inquiry into October 7. He has refused to outline a coherent plan for governance and security in Gaza the day after the war ends. Qatar has withdrawn as mediator with Hamas after accusing both sides of refusing “to engage constructively.”
And Netanyahu continues to be stalked by the scandal that has long followed him through his career. His critics – among whom are prosecutors, investigators and journalists – allege that that success has come through an aggressive and high-stakes strategy, which has led in recent weeks to a raft of new inquiries and revelations.
His lawyers this week asked an Israeli court to delay by 10 weeks a deposition he was set to give in a yearslong corruption case lodged against him. “Over the past two months, it has been almost impossible to hold meetings for the purpose of preparing the Prime Minister for testimony,” his office said in a letter to the court.

An aide has now spent weeks in custody after allegedly leaking manipulated intelligence reports about Hamas to foreign media. In focus, too, is the allegation that Netanyahu’s office has tried to cover up actions taken in the opening hours of October 7, 2023, by altering the minutes of emergency meetings. Journalistic investigations allege that Netanyahu may have had advance warning about Hamas’ attack, and that he shut his defense secretary out of meetings in the days after.
The denials come as quickly as the allegations. “This is another hunting expedition,” his office said. Another report was “mendacious.” A third was “entirely baseless.” Netanyahu himself entered the fray Sunday evening. “In recent days, my office has been under a wild and unchecked attack,” he said in a taped statement. “As I lead this war and deflect international attacks from various arenas, we are now confronting an additional front – the fake news from the media.”
The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported that on the eve of Hamas’ October 7 attack, the Prime Minister’s Office was aware that the group was activating Israeli SIM cards for cell phones en masse – suggesting an impeding operation inside Israel. His office called that report a lie “aimed at covering up the serious failures of others on the night of October 7.” (Netanyahu has resisted calls from the likes of Gallant to launch to a state commission of inquiry into October 7 failings, saying it must wait until after the war.)

Israel’s Netanyahu acknowledges pager attack, says he sees ‘eye-to-eye’ with Trump on Iran
The left-wing Israeli Ha’aretz newspaper said in an editorial that the slew of revelations “could rival those of a mafia,” and were an attempt to “evade the judgments of the criminal justice system, the public and history.”
“We have tough enemies from the outside,” opposition leader Yair Lapid said in a statement, “but the danger from within the house, and at the heart of the most sensitive decision-making centers, is shaking the foundations of the Israeli public’s trust in the management of the war and in the handling of the most sensitive and volatile security issues.”
Domestic politics dominate the conversation in Israel even as the security chiefs insinuate their work is done – or at least, just about. “Militarily, there is nothing to do in Gaza,” Yoav Gallant told families of hostages still held in Gaza, hours before leaving his post as defense minister, according to Israel’s Channel 13. It is now for the politicians, he said, to lead the next step and bring home 101 hostages.

As Trump was able to do in the United States, the investigations may end up playing to Netanyahu’s advantage, said Nadav Shtrauchler, a political strategist who has worked closely with the prime minister.
“He took this lemon and presented it as lemonade,” he said. “It’s easy to do it,” he explained, because to Netanyahu’s base, the investigations are examples of brazen and selective prosecution. The slate of accusations against the prime minister, he said, are “an opportunity” to brand himself as the victim of a witch hunt. “And this is how he sees it.”
The Prime Minister’s Office argues, in essence, that it’s Netanyahu against the deep state. Israeli media on Sunday reported that Netanyahu boasted during a cabinet meeting: “The beeper operation and the elimination of (Hezbollah leader Hassan) Nasrallah were launched despite the opposition of senior officials in the security establishment and the political echelon in charge of them.”
It so happens that that was also the first time that Israel acknowledged it was behind the deadly September incident that detonated explosives in thousands of pagers across Lebanon. The attack has already gained cult status in Israel – harkening back to the days when the Mossad staged daring operations around the world.
Israeli media report that Netanyahu would like to further clean house of his political rivals – including the head of the Israel Security Agency (also known as Shin Bet) Ronen Bar and the attorney general, Gali Baharav Miara. The judicial reforms that were stalled last year – and notably opposed by Gallant, the now-former defense minister – remain on the prime minister’s agenda, reports in Israeli media suggest.

It is Baharav Miara who poses among the most serious threats to Netanyahu. The Israeli leader has for years faced three criminal investigations – the most serious of which alleges that he gave regulatory benefits worth up to 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to his friend in exchange for favorable media coverage. Netanyahu has denied any wrong doing.
Reports in Israeli media this week suggest that his office may be floating a trial balloon for dismissing Baharav Miara. A reported conversation about her from Sunday’s cabinet meeting found its way into the press, with one minister saying of the attorney general: “There’s only one answer: fire her.”
After Gallant’s dismissal, Netanyahu’s office said that reports that he plans to fire more people in the security establishment were “incorrect and are designed to sow discord and rifts.”

190,Isreal,2024,11,"Eyeing Trump support, Israeli minister pushes for West Bank settlement annexation",Dana Karni,"CNN
 — 
Israel’s far-right finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has ordered preparations for the annexation of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Smotrich, who is in charge of the settlements, said on Monday that he had instructed his department to “prepare the necessary infrastructure for applying sovereignty.”
It is unclear whether his long-standing desire to apply full Israeli law in West Bank settlements has any chance of being implemented soon.
The Prime Minister’s Office is yet to comment on Smotrich’s order. However, earlier Monday, Gideon Sa’ar, Israel’s new foreign minister, told a press briefing that the government had made no decision on the issue of annexation as yet, but noted it had been discussed during Donald Trump’s first term as US president and added that “if it will be relevant it will be discussed again with our friends in Washington.”
Observers said Smotrich’s announcement was likely motivated in large part by staking out political ground in Israel’s fractious domestic politics.
Still, it drew swift condemnation from the Palestinian Authority, whose foreign affairs ministry characterized such comments as “a blatantly colonial and racist extension of the ongoing campaign of extermination and forced displacement against the Palestinian people.”
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority’s presidency, said Smotrich’s comments confirmed “the Israeli government’s intention to finalize its plans for taking control of the West Bank by 2025” and said he held both the “Israeli occupation authorities” and the US administration responsible for allowing Israel to “persist in its crimes, aggression and defiance of international legitimacy and international law.”
Trump victory brings ‘opportunity’
Smotrich told the Knesset, or Israeli parliament, that US President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in the US election “brings an important opportunity for the state of Israel.”
The “only way to remove” the “threat” of a Palestinian state, Smotrich added, “is to apply Israeli sovereignty over the entire settlements in Judea and Samaria,” the biblical term by which Israelis refer to the West Bank.

Lebanon, Gaza and Syria hit by deadly Israeli strikes, reports say
Israel has occupied the West Bank since seizing the territory from Jordan in 1967. In the decades since, it has expanded Jewish settlements in the area, which are considered illegal under international law, despite signing a series of peace agreements with the Palestinians in the 1990s.
Around half a million Israelis live in West Bank settlements. Smotrich, himself a settler, has long called for Israeli law to apply in the settlements, and previously opposed the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
The minister said he intends to “lead a government decision” that will allow Israel to “work with the new administration of President Trump and the international community to apply sovereignty and achieve American and international recognition.”
During his first term, Trump took several steps in Israel’s favor. In 2017, he recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, upending decades of US policy and international consensus. He also recognized Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 war and is also considered occupied under international law.
“I have instructed the Settlement Division in the Ministry of Defense and the Civil Administration to begin professional and comprehensive work to prepare the necessary infrastructure for applying sovereignty,” Smotrich said on Monday.
“In his first term, President Trump led dramatic steps, including… affirming the legality and legitimacy of settlements in Judea and Samaria,” Smotrich added. “Alongside this, there were the Abraham Accords – peace for peace.” Those accords, a set of agreements facilitated by Trump’s first administration, saw Israel normalize relations with four Arab nations.
“We were on the verge of applying sovereignty over the settlements in Judea and Samaria, and now the time has come to do so,” Smotrich said.
Ideas of peace ‘delusional’: Hamas
Hamas, the Palestinian militant group Israel is fighting in the Gaza Strip some 60 miles from the West Bank, seized on Smotrich’s comments, saying they confirmed “the colonial intentions of the occupation” and refuted “the claims of those who are delusional about achieving peace and coexistence” with Israel.
Another militant group, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said it was “tantamount to an admission of the open war waged by the criminal entity against the Palestinian people.”
Israel has been waging its war in Gaza since the Hamas-led terror attack on October 7 that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 taken hostage. Since then, more than 43,500 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip, with the United Nations reporting that most of the dead are women and children.
At the same time, another major escalation of violence has been playing out in the West Bank, where more than 700 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since the war began, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. The attacks are occurring amid a surge in Israeli settler violence across the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem, where some settlers continue a campaign targeting Palestinian civilians and infrastructure.
In both places, the violence shows little sign of abating, with Gaza hospital authorities on Monday reporting dozens of deaths from new strikes across the enclave.
At least 10 people were killed in an Israeli strike on Al Mawasi, west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, according to Nasser hospital officials and the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The aid group said the strike hit a cafe housing displaced people.
Multiple strikes in Nuseirat in central Gaza killed at least 20, according to Al Awda hospital, while in Gaza City, an airstrike killed at least two people, according to Al Ahli Baptist hospital officials.
CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the strikes.
The latest violence comes even as Israeli Foreign Minister Sa’ar suggested at his press briefing Monday that Israel was open to ending its military operations in Gaza. The foreign minister told the briefing that Palestinians would be able to return to their homes in the north when the war ends – though he cautioned this would not happen before Israel’s objectives were achieved.
He also appeared to rule out the possibility of creating a separate Palestinian state, saying this would pose a security threat to Israel. Asked about the possibility, he responded, “in a word: no.”
Meanwhile, Arab League and Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) leaders meeting in Riyadh for the Arab-Islamic summit condemned Israel’s measures in the occupied West Bank.
In its closing statement, the summit called on the UN Security Council and international community to take action to “stop the escalating illegal Israeli measures in the occupied West Bank that undermine the two-state solution” and to “condemn colonial policies pursued by the occupying power to annex any part of the occupied Palestinian territory by force with the aim of expanding illegal settler colonialism.”

191,General Politics,2024,11,Trump names Dr. Mehmet Oz to head Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,Tami Luhby,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump has picked Dr. Mehmet Oz to serve as the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a key federal agency that oversees health insurance coverage for more than 150 million Americans.
“I have known Dr. Oz for many years, and I am confident he will fight to ensure everyone in America receives the best possible Healthcare, so our Country can be Great and Healthy Again!” Trump said in a statement on Tuesday. “Dr. Oz will be a leader in incentivizing Disease Prevention, so we get the best results in the World for every dollar we spend on Healthcare in our Great Country.”
Trump, who is also seeking to slash spending in the federal government and has long had Medicaid in mind for reductions, also promised Oz would take a scalpel to the massive agency.
“He will also cut waste and fraud within our Country’s most expensive Government Agency, which is a third of our Nation’s Healthcare spend, and a quarter of our entire National Budget,” the president-elect said in his statement.
Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and television personality, ran unsuccessfully for Senate in 2022 in Pennsylvania with Trump’s backing. He lost to Democratic now-Sen. John Fetterman.
In 2018, Trump appointed Oz to the Presidential Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, reappointing him to the position in 2020.
Oz rose to fame as a frequent guest of Oprah Winfrey, eventually launching his own syndicated daytime TV talk show in 2009. Through “The Dr. Oz Show,” which won several daytime Emmy awards and reached millions of viewers, Oz became one of the most well-known doctors in the country.
His views on Covid-19, however, sparked controversy. Early on in the pandemic, for instance, Oz talked up the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a way to treat the coronavirus — despite the lack of firm scientific evidence that it was an effective treatment. Many of Oz’s perspectives were praised by Republicans at the time.
Oz’s selection continues Trump’s string of unconventional picks for key roles in his administration, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. If they are both confirmed, Kennedy would be Oz’s boss. For CMS administrator in his first term, Trump chose Seema Verma, who had a long history in health policy and consulting with a specialty in Medicaid.
Supported Obamacare in the past
Before he ran for Senate, Oz voiced support for Obamacare, CNN’s KFile reported in 2022, though his then-campaign spokesperson walked back those views, saying Oz would not have voted for the landmark health reform law.
Still, Oz’s earlier backing of the Affordable Care Act stands in sharp contrast with Trump’s view on the law, which he promised to repeal and replace in his first presidential campaign. Though Trump now says he would not try to get rid of Obamacare, he has repeatedly said he would replace it with a better plan – though the president-elect has not provided details on such a policy.
If confirmed, Oz would be responsible for overseeing the Affordable Care Act exchanges, which have enrolled more than 20 million people in 2024 – a record – between the federal and state-run marketplaces. In Trump’s first term, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pulled back on marketing and enrollment assistance, as well as shortened the sign-up period, leading to a decline in the number of people covered.
Oz would also have control over two major federal health programs, Medicare and Medicaid, which cover tens of millions of elderly Americans and low-income residents, respectively.
Oz has long voiced support for Medicare Advantage, a fast-growing program in which the federal government pays private insurers to provide coverage to senior citizens and disabled Americans. In his Senate campaign, he supported a health care plan called “Medicare Advantage Plus,” an expansion of the popular program.
The Biden administration has made several changes to the program in recent years to address criticism that insurers are overpaid. Insurers argue the payments are not enough to cover their medical costs, and some have curtailed the number of plans they offer in the program.
The CMS administrator is expected to play an important role in the second Trump administration since Republicans are expected to propose changes to Medicaid, which they have sought to shrink in the past. Plus, the White House and GOP lawmakers will have to decide what to do next year about the enhanced Obamacare premium subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025.
Oz has also held other views that are not in line with traditional Republican orthodoxy. As a physician, for example, he advocated that everyone in America have insurance – a view held by progressives, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has long pushed for “Medicare for All.” Oz has said that the government should provide health care coverage to Americans who cannot afford it. “It should be mandatory that everybody in America have health care coverage. If you can’t afford it, we have to give it to you,” Oz told The Seattle Times in 2009.
Oz, who is an advocate of alternative medicines and treatments, has been skewered by the medical community for years. In 2015, a group of physicians wrote Columbia University, saying they were “dismayed” Oz was a member of the school’s faculty. And in 2014, Oz was scolded by senators during a congressional hearing over his promotion of weight-loss products on his television show.
Mixed reaction
Reaction to Oz’s nomination fell largely along party lines.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor who is set to lead the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions next year, praised the nominee, noting that it has been more than a decade since a doctor led CMS.
“This is a great opportunity to help patients and implement conservative health reforms,” the Louisiana Republican posted on X.
But New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat and ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the nomination shows that “Trump is not concerned about Americans’ health care.”
“Given the crucial importance of this agency, I am alarmed that President-elect Trump has chosen a TV celebrity without the experience or background to lead it,” he said in a statement. “By nominating both RFK, Jr. and Dr. Oz, Trump is doubling down on leaders that peddle in dangerous misinformation that endangers public health.”
Left-leaning advocates also voiced concerns about the agency’s direction with Oz as administrator.
“Dr. Oz’s past policy positions suggest he’d be strongly in favor of the Project 2025 plan to make Medicare Advantage — privatized Medicare — the default for all Medicare enrollees,” Andrea Ducas, vice president of health policy at the Center for American Progress, said in a statement. “Such a policy would be a multi-billion-dollar giveaway to corporations that limits older Americans’ health care choices while putting Medicare’s future at risk. Medicare Advantage is in need of major reform, not unchecked expansion.”

192,General Politics,2024,11,"Linda McMahon expected to be named Education secretary, sources say",Kristen Holmes,"CNN
 — 
Trump transition co-chair Linda McMahon is expected to be named as secretary of the Department of Education, four sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
The decision took shape after it became clear that McMahon would be passed over for Commerce secretary. President-elect Donald Trump named his other transition co-chair Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department earlier Tuesday after the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO had thrown his name into the mix for Treasury secretary, sparking a battle with hedge fund manager Scott Bessent.
McMahon served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term. She was appointed in 2017 and resigned in 2019 to become the chair of America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC.
She is the board chair of the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank that was formed in 2021 by McMahon, Larry Kudlow and other advisers from the first Trump administration.
AFPI has raised millions of dollars since it was founded and has been described as a “White-House-in-waiting,” planning potential policy proposals for Trump’s second term.
McMahon is also the former CEO of the WWE, which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. As head of the WWE, McMahon oversaw its transformation from a small wrestling entertainment company into a publicly traded media empire. She stepped down as CEO in 2009.
McMahon twice ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in Connecticut, losing in 2010 and 2012. She self-funded those campaigns, spending $50.1 million in 2010 and $48.7 million in 2012, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks campaign financing. Trump donated $5,000 to her campaign in 2012.
McMahon herself is a major Republican donor. During Trump’s first campaign for president, McMahon donated more than $7 million to two pro-Trump super PACs, according to Open Secrets.

193,General Politics,2024,11,Trump picks Lutnick to be Commerce secretary,Kristen Holmes,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump announced Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick as his pick for secretary of the Department of Commerce on Tuesday, selecting his transition co-chair for a key role in an administration that the president-elect has promised will enact sweeping tariffs.
“He will lead our Tariff and Trade agenda, with additional direct responsibility for the Office of the United States Trade Representative,” Trump said in a statement.
Lutnick, who has served as the co-chair of Trump’s presidential transition team since August, had been in a battle with hedge fund manager Scott Bessent over the role of Treasury secretary after throwing his own name into the mix.
CNN reported earlier Tuesday that Trump was expected to nominate Lutnick, according to two sources familiar with the process. In being tapped for Commerce, Lutnick edged out Robert Lighthizer, the US trade representative during Trump’s first term, and Linda McMahon, an administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019, for the role. Both were informed in the last day or so that Lutnick was getting the job.
The move surprised several in Trump’s orbit, given McMahon had been the clear front-runner for the role. Then, last week, Lighthizer appeared closer to getting it. And then, amid the battle for the Treasury, Trump decided to go with his transition co-chair.
For the last several months, Lutnick and McMahon have co-chaired the transition together, with Lutnick handling personnel matters, such as vetting and advising Trump on Cabinet nominees, and McMahon running the policy side. McMahon had become frustrated that Trump hadn’t named her to the Commerce role last week, when it became clear he was considering Lighthizer and thinking of an ambassador position for her instead. Then, she was abruptly informed that her transition co-chair was actually being awarded the Commerce job.
The Commerce secretary is tasked with supporting US businesses and often acts as an emissary between other nations to negotiate trade deals and increase foreign investment. There are 13 bureaus housed under the Commerce Department, including the Census Bureau, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Patent and Trademark Office.
Project 2025 — the controversial blueprint for a newly reimagined federal government that Trump tried to distance himself from during the campaign despite numerous ties to its authors — called for NOAA to be “broken up and downsized” and said the agency was part of the “climate change alarm industry.”
The Commerce secretary often works hand-in-hand with other members of the president’s Cabinet tasked with carrying out and advising on economic policy. During Trump’s first term, then-Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was heavily involved in the heated trade war with China and was a key advocate for levying higher tariffs on the nation.
At Trump’s Madison Square Garden campaign rally last month, Lutnick said the US was most prosperous during the early 1900s, when there was “no income tax and all we had was tariffs.”
“We had so much money that we had the greatest businessmen of America get together to try to figure out how to spend it,” said Lutnick, 63, who has been advocating for higher tariffs. As a candidate, Trump pledged to impose 60% tariffs on goods from China, as well as 10% tariffs on goods from other countries.
Lutnick came under fire for recent comments he made to CNN on “The Source,” in which he defended Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s unproven view that vaccines are contributing to higher rates of autism in children. Trump announced Kennedy as his pick to serve as Health and Human Services secretary last week.
After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the World Trade Center, Lutnick started a relief fund for families who lost loved ones. Cantor’s headquarters occupied some of the highest floors of the North Tower, and on the day of the attack, the company lost several hundred employees, including Lutnick’s brother.
Lutnick sits on the board of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum.

195,General Politics,2024,11,Manhattan DA agrees to postpone Donald Trump’s sentencing in hush money case but opposes dismissal,Paula Reid,"CNN
 — 
The Manhattan district attorney’s office said Tuesday it would agree to postpone Donald Trump’s sentencing in his hush money case to give prosecutors time to litigate the president-elect’s expected motion to dismiss the case.
In a letter to Judge Juan Merchan, the district attorney’s office also acknowledged that Trump is not likely to be sentenced “until after the end of Defendant’s upcoming presidential term.” But the DA says Trump’s felony conviction should stand.
A source in close to the district attorney’s office said it is open to a four year pause of the case.
The developments cap a historic and unprecedented turnaround for Trump’s legal and political fate. One year ago, Trump was facing four separate indictments. Now, as he prepares to retake the White House, the strategy of Trump’s lawyers to try to push all of his cases beyond the 2024 election has proved wildly successful, with the two federal cases about to be wound down, the Georgia state case long dormant and the New York case poised to end indefinitely without a sentence.
Trump was convicted in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records over payments made to his then-lawyer Michael Cohen to reimburse a $130,000 hush money payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to keep her from speaking out about an alleged affair before the 2016 election. (Trump has denied the affair.)
In the letter to Merchan, the Manhattan district attorney argued the judge should not dismiss Trump’s conviction.
“No current law establishes that a president’s temporary immunity from prosecution requires dismissal of a post-trial criminal proceeding that was initiated at a time when the defendant was not immune from criminal prosecution and that is based on official conduct for which the defendant is also not immune,” the district attorney’s office wrote.
In a statement, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung called the filing “a total and definitive victory for President Trump.”
Merchan had been set to rule last week on whether to overturn the conviction based on this summer’s US Supreme Court decision that Trump should receive broad immunity for official acts during his time in office and that official acts can’t be used as evidence in a criminal trial.
But the district attorney’s office acknowledged the “unprecedented circumstances” of Trump’s election as president, and Merchan’s ruling was postponed.
Trump’s lawyers have argued the conviction should be tossed both because of the presidential immunity decision and because he’s about to return to the White House.
“The stay, and dismissal, are necessary to avoid unconstitutional impediments to President Trump’s ability to govern,” Trump attorney Emil Bove wrote in emails exchanged with the court and the district attorney’s office this month. Trump has picked Bove to fill a high-ranking Justice Department spot in his new administration.
Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former prosecutor, said Tuesday that the postponement of Trump’s sentencing was an inevitable outcome of his election.
“The clock ran out,” Honig said. “We like to say no person is above the law in this country, but the fact is one person largely is, and that’s the president, because of the immunity ruling and because of the DOJ policy” that a sitting president cannot be prosecuted.
“That’s just sort of the cold, hard reality of the way our system works,” he added.
Sentencing was delayed twice before election
Trump was indicted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg last spring, the first of four indictments he would face in 2023.
It would ultimately be the only case against Trump to go to trial: The federal election subversion case was delayed indefinitely by the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling; a Trump-appointed federal judge dismissed the classified documents case; and the Georgia case has languished amid a push from Trump and his co-defendants to have the Fulton County district attorney removed from the case.
A Manhattan jury found Trump guilty on all 34 felony counts after a two-month trial.
But Trump’s sentencing, originally scheduled for July, was delayed twice after the Supreme Court’s immunity decision prompted Trump’s lawyers to file a motion to vacate the conviction. That effort, along with other tactics, including seeking to move the case into federal court, further delayed the proceedings and prompted Merchan to push the sentencing decision and a ruling on immunity until after the November election.
Trump’s lawyers have argued the conviction should be tossed because the district attorney’s office relied on evidence related to Trump’s official acts as president during his first term, which should not have been presented to the jury at trial.
Bragg’s office has said Trump’s conviction should stand and that the evidence presented at trial was “overwhelming.”

196,General Politics,2024,11,Even Iowa Republicans who initially wanted to move on from Trump see hope — and a mandate — in his win,John King,"Kellerton, Iowa
CNN
 — 
Shanen Ebersole believes if people better understood her life they would better understand her unapologetic vote for Donald Trump.
“The majority of people who voted for Trump are not the far-right crazies,” Ebersole said in an interview. “That is not who we are. We are simple Americans who want to live our lives and do our jobs and make our own choices in our own homes.”
Ebersole and her husband have a cattle ranch in southwest Iowa, in a little town of rolling hills and gravel roads.
“DoorDash isn’t a thing,” Ebersole said with a smile. “Pizza delivery is not a thing. You can’t even get pizza delivered where we live.”
Kellerton is in Ringgold County, along the Iowa-Missouri border. Trump won 75% of the county vote. Ebersole said the reasons why are straightforward.
“Care about all of us, don’t prioritize small individual groups first,” she said. “We felt as though Washington and the far edges of our country were governing the rest of middle America.”
Ebersole wasn’t as bullish about Trump at the outset of the presidential campaign. Yes, she voted for him in 2016 and 2020, but she supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the Iowa caucuses because while she approves of most Trump policies, she believed it important that Republicans find a new leader who could be both president and role model.
“He wasn’t as respectful as I think our president should be,” Ebersole told us when we first met in December 2023. “Because he didn’t bring us together. Because of the divisiveness. Because of my liberal friends who were literally scared for their safety.”
Once Trump clinched the nomination, Ebersole said her choice was easy because of Biden-Harris administration farm and climate policies she says punish small operators like her family business. “Those policies made it a no-brainer for me,” Ebersole said. “My only reticence was wanting to bring us together.”
Now, with Trump preparing to return to the White House, Ebersole again stressed her hope for a less confrontational politics. But her tone about Trump and the sources of division is different.
“They are still scared,” she said of her liberal friends. “The fear tactics of the left make them more afraid of Trump. … The point that I would really tell my liberal friends to understand is just because we voted in a very conservative president, that means that we don’t want to put rules on you either. We just care about our own liberties.”
Ebersole is among the voters who participated in our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters in key voting blocs or from key campaign battlegrounds. Iowa was our first stop, back when the first question of the 2024 campaign was whether Trump retained his grip on the GOP. We visited three times during the campaign, and then returned after the election to get a sense of what these Republican voters want and expect when Trump returns to the White House in January.
Ebersole said she hopes the president-elect reads his mandate as an urgent call to focus on the economy and immigration.
“Deportation is necessary because we have allowed way too many undocumented people to come in,” Ebersole said. “But we also need a path, a path for those people to become Americans.”
She is an unabashed fan of Trump’s call for tariffs on foreign products.
“Why are we bringing Argentinian beef in?” she asked. “Why are we bringing in New Zealand and Australian beef in and then exporting some of our beef? Why don’t we first just feed our beef to our Americans?”
And she hopes Trump looks at his victory in the popular vote and understands that voters like her want him to set aside the campaign talk about rooting out “the enemy within” or seeking retribution. “We are not letting him be a bully, but we want him to stand firm,” she said.
After considering Biden, she’s trusting Trump
Like Ebersole, Betsy Sarcone began the election cycle believing it was time for Republicans to move on from Trump. She was so adamant that she initially said she would vote for President Joe Biden if it came down to a rematch of the 2020 race.
“I just can’t put my rubber stamp on Trump having more influence over this country,” Sarcone told us in August 2023. “Because I view Trump as not having any personal accountability.”
But Sarcone viewed Vice President Kamala Harris as too liberal and inauthentic and ended up “actually excited” to cast her vote for Trump.
“I’ve come to the conclusion that I don’t love Donald Trump as a person, but I do think he is right for the country right now and that he is going to chart a different course.”
“I’m feeling relieved,” she said in an interview at her home in suburban Des Moines last week. “Honestly, it’s nice to not have to feel like you are silent anymore.”
That last part is instructive; Trump’s win in the popular vote alongside his battleground state sweeps is emboldening to his supporters

When we first met Sarcone, Trump’s toxic language and temper were reasons she cited in searching for a different Republican candidate. Now, though, when asked about Trump’s angry words at campaign rallies, she offered a different take.
“What I see is him being mad at an open border, being mad at the crime rates, being mad at the economy,” Sarcone said. “I’m completely OK with that.”
Her priorities: lower interest rates to help her real estate business, and lower grocery prices. “I’m a mom, single mother of three kids,” she said. “So that does make a huge difference in my life.”
She does not have amnesia about Trump’s first term. “When Trump gets off track, off his train of thought, that’s when we get in trouble. If we are focused on the goals, focused on what we really need to fix this country, I think we are going to be OK,” Sarcone said.
Her patience is already being tested, though Sarcone said she has a different perspective on how to cope.
Some early Trump Cabinet picks, especially former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, have triggered eye rolls or worse.
“Not necessarily excited,” Sarcone said. “Worried? I wouldn’t say I am worried. … I’m just going to put my trust in him at this point.”
She stays calm by remembering she could not vote for Harris.
“I voted for change, as did the majority of people, and that is what we are going to get,” Sarcone said. “So I don’t think worrying about it every day is going to do me any good.”
Excited for Trump even if business takes a hit
Chris Mudd is a Team Trump original — going back to 2015.
He owns Midwest Solar and his vote could hurt his business; the startup has benefited from Biden administration clean energy incentives.
“It’s possible,” Mudd said of taking a hit if Trump ends those incentives. “I sell value. I sell saving money, not selling the green energy side of the business.”
But he urged Trump to go full speed ahead, including with tariffs that could raise prices on Chinese components he needs for some big solar installations.
“Most of our stuff is tariff free,” Mudd said in an interview at his Waterloo office last week. “So, I want to see more products and services get built in this country. I want to see our pharmaceuticals get produced here instead of China.”

Mudd believes Congress should confirm Trump’s personnel picks and quickly act on his policy priorities as well.
“It’s important that we round up every illegal and ship them out,” Mudd said. “And we have to figure out a way to get them back to work. I do believe that we need immigration. A country needs immigration. It just needs to be legal.”
Mudd said the mood among Trump supporters is “excitement and optimism. … The stock market is jumping up. I think business is going to get good.”
And he took issue with Trump critics who see his agenda as mean spirited.
“I would say, ‘Get over it,’” Mudd said. “I don’t believe there is anything to be scared of. There are people who are scared. But I believe it is false. I believe they are scared over things that are not real.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/iowa-voters-trump-mandate/index.html
197,General Politics,2024,11,Gaetz is quietly lobbying Republican senators ‘to give him a shot’ as Trump’s attorney general,Sarah Ferris,"CNN
 — 
Former Rep. Matt Gaetz is quietly urging GOP senators to give him a chance to prove himself suitable to be attorney general amid growing calls from top Republicans to access a House Ethics Committee report expected to detail allegations of sexual misconduct involving the ex-congressman.
The GOP senator set to lead the Senate Judiciary Committee next year told CNN that having the House Ethics report would speed up the confirmation hearings, as Gaetz and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance head to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to try to lock down support for President-elect Donald Trump’s controversial pick. And Gaetz himself has been making calls to GOP senators and visiting his own loyalists in the House GOP.
The pressure is all building ahead of a planned Wednesday meeting of the House ethics panel, which is expected to discuss the fate of the report. If the panel does decide to vote on whether to publish the findings, it would take only one Republican to break with their party leadership for it to be released. But privately, Republicans on the panel are signaling that they could bury the report as Gaetz and Trump are making direct appeals.
Even though Gaetz is no longer a member of the House, his now-former colleagues are proceeding with extreme caution when it comes to the sensitive report into allegations of misconduct, including “sexual misconduct and illicit drug use” that could tank his future as Trump’s attorney general. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex.
With the fate of the panel’s report up in the air, GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley, who will become Senate Judiciary chairman next Congress, told CNN that his panel would make it easier to move ahead with confirmation hearings quickly in the new year if the Ethics Committee were to release its report, given the interest from Republicans in seeing it. That’s a key signal that the Senate GOP may pursue the potentially damaging information against Gaetz even as pressure intensifies on Capitol Hill from Trump and Gaetz himself to proceed with the confirmation.
“I think that if they want a speedy consideration of this nomination … we’ve got to have as much transparency as we can have,” Grassley said. “You’ve heard my colleagues, especially on the Republican side, say that they have some questions … and I think it would help faster consideration, the extent to which they would make as much available as they can.”
Grassley declined to say if he has spoken with Gaetz or Trump about the nomination.
Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, is expected to be among the senators with whom Gaetz and Vance meet during their trip to the Hill on Wednesday. Vance is also expected to bring some of Trump’s other cabinet picks to meet with senators, including former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, who is slated to run the Department of Defense; Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick to serve as the ambassador to the United Nations; and Rep. Doug Collins, whom Trump has selected to serve as secretary of Veterans Affairs, three sources familiar with the plans told CNN.
Gaetz has been making calls to GOP senators — including Sen. Lindsey Graham, the current top Republican on Judiciary — and his former House colleagues, visiting the House Freedom Caucus in a private meeting Monday night. In a call last week to GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, Gaetz urged him “to give him a shot,” Hawley told CNN. The Missouri Republican said he wants to let Gaetz address the allegations at his confirmation hearing next year. Hawley, who sits on the Senate Judiciary panel, also wouldn’t say if he wanted to see the House Ethics report on Gaetz, contending he expected the information to leak one way or the other.
Yet House Republicans and Democrats alike — including some with the power to seriously hinder his nomination as attorney general by releasing a potentially explosive Ethics report — are signaling they have no interest in crossing the lightning rod figure who could become Trump’s top law enforcement official. They see Gaetz as someone with a powerful perch who could make life miserable for anyone who goes against him — whether he holds the title of attorney general or not.
That includes GOP Rep. Mike Simpson, a famously outspoken Gaetz antagonist. When asked how Gaetz would lead the department, the senior Republican paused before looking to his spokeswoman.
“Should I say it?” Simpson said with a chuckle, turning to her. “I think no comment is a great comment,” his spokeswoman said. Pressed on the matter, Simpson added: “Put it this way, if I was in the Senate, I would want to see the report.”
And even House Armed Services Chairman, who lunged at Gaetz on the House floor when he first tried to block Kevin McCarthy from becoming speaker, downplayed their tense history.
“Matt and I got along fine. He’s on my committee. We worked together for years. I disagreed with him that day, but absolutely no, we’ve been fine ever since then.”
But when asked if Gaetz should become attorney general, Rogers said, “that’s the president’s call.”
Republicans and Democrats across the Capitol describe Gaetz as someone who is carefully calculated and always operating five or 10 steps ahead of those around him. They believe that, like Trump, he keeps an enemies list. Even members who said they weren’t wary of retribution from Gaetz wouldn’t respond, even without their names attached, if they believed he was qualified.
“Anybody who thinks they can predict or forecast what Gaetz is going to do doesn’t know Gaetz,” one GOP lawmaker who has worked with him for years said. Asked if Gaetz could use the office to seek retribution of his enemies, this member said: “One would be right to say, ‘Oh my God, is he’s going to be doing that?’ Because that’s his style.”
Rep. Tim Burchett, who is a close ally of Gaetz, said he’s noticed that some members have been more critical since the Florida congressman left the House.
“I see some people taking shots at him now because he’s not here. But they didn’t do that when they were standing here next to him,” he said, adding: “He is incredibly calculated.”
Democrats on the panel also have access to the report. But so far, those lawmakers are also proceeding extremely carefully with the information.
“I really think they should have a chance to look at the evidence and make a decision for themselves,” Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland told reporters, arguing it is essential to the Senate’s “advise and consent” role.
Asked if he had read the report, which is now available for members, Ivey said he would “not really get into particulars.”
“It’s available. The key point is that the Senate should have a chance to look at it, not us,” he said.
Meanwhile, nearly 100 House Democrats are calling on the House Ethics Committee to “immediately” release the report.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/gaetz-lobbying-republican-senators-attorney-general/index.html
198,General Politics,2024,11,Biden’s major missile reversal complicates potential western diplomatic thaw with Moscow,Kayla Tausche,"Rio de Janeiro
CNN
 — 
A major decision by the United States to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles deeper inside Russian territory has complicated a potential western diplomatic thaw with Russia as dozens of world leaders gather this week.
Sunday’s decision was viewed by many western leaders as a way to position Ukraine for success ahead of a change in American leadership, with the incoming president skeptical of continued US assistance.
But it also complicated the diplomatic dance leaders attending the G20 summit must partake in as they navigate the complex geopolitical dynamics of the bloc.
Russia “will perceive launches of long-range missiles guided by US military experts as a qualitatively new phase of war by the West,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during a news conference at the summit, according to Russian state media TASS.
Lavrov attended the G20 in place of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who faced questions about whether he could be arrested for war crimes on international soil. Days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Brazilian authorities to arrest Putin, the Russian leader said he would skip the summit to avoid disrupting it.
Amid the change in strategy – which Biden had deliberated over for months – the president and his team steered clear of Lavrov on the ground in Rio.
When Biden missed a photo with other leaders on Monday, speculation abounded that he was trying to avoid being photographed with Lavrov. The White House denied that, citing a logistical snafu.
Still, neither Biden nor his delegation held talks with Lavrov or his team, US officials said. And Biden and Lavrov’s fluid schedules meant that they were not photographed together with other world leaders.
But some Western allies, sensing a sea change in the US approach to the conflict once Donald Trump takes office, appear to be weighing a shift in their own stance toward Moscow.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spoke to Putin by phone the week before the summit. In his remarks at the close of the summit, Lavrov also hailed the German government’s refusal to send Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine as a “responsible stance,” TASS reported.
And onsite in Rio, French President Emmanuel Macron could be seen shaking the hand of Lavrov, standing in the row behind him during a “family photo” of attendees.
In Rio, the pending Trump presidency shadowed nearly every discussion of the Ukraine conflict. Leaders here are acutely aware of Trump’s views toward the war, but are less certain of how that will manifest in policy once he takes office.
It’s not clear, for example, whether Trump would uphold Biden’s decision on allowing Ukraine the long-range capability, a step that NATO leaders had been encouraging for months. Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, questioned the decision in an interview Monday.
“It’s another step up the escalation ladder and nobody knows where this is going,” he said on Fox News, adding he hadn’t been given a heads up by the outgoing administration about the change in policy.
Officials in Rio declined to say whether Biden had raised the issue of the missiles with Trump during their two-hour meeting in the Oval Office last week.
“The two presidents discussed a wide range of issues. We’ve been pretty careful not to read that conversation out in any detail. Certainly, the conversation included all of the major issues of geopolitical significance, but I’m not going to get into the details of it,” deputy national security adviser Jon Finer said.
There had been hope among western officials of a strong statement denouncing Russia’s invasion at the conclusion of the summit. In particular, European diplomats made a late-stage push to strengthen the language following Russia’s massive drone and missile attack on Sunday, according to people familiar with the talks.
Ultimately, the effort was dropped when it appeared other countries were not on board. The language in the final leaders statement was watered down from previous years, including broad references to “human suffering” and “negative added impacts of the war” without explicit condemnation of Russia.
The Ukraine war generated only one paragraph in the final document, compared to several that were included in the final document produced by the G20 last year in New Delhi — which itself was watered down from the previous year.
As the summit was concluding, it was evident that tensions between the US and Russia were only ratcheting up. Russia announced as the second day of the summit was getting underway that it would update its nuclear doctrine to consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Moscow.
American officials were unsurprised to learn Moscow had updated its nuclear doctrine following Biden’s decision on long-range missiles.
“Russia had been signaling its intent to update its doctrine for several weeks,” a US official said in response to the doctrine update, adding that so far the US has not observed any updates to Russia’s nuclear posture — and thus see no reason to change the US stance.
“This is more of the same irresponsible rhetoric from Russia, which we have seen for the past two years,” the official said.
In his closing remarks, Lavrov sought to downplay the change in the fine print on its nuclear posture – shifting blame instead to the West.
“The update of the military doctrine does not add anything which would be different… from the American doctrine or documents on what to do with nuclear weapons,” according to Russian state media.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-missile-decision/index.html

 — 
Donald Trump is creating a show of force that will help define his new term as he tries to leverage Matt Gaetz into the attorney general’s office.
The president-elect has been calling senators to press them to confirm his pick early next year, CNN reported Monday — even as counter pressure grows from GOP senators who want to see a House Ethics Committee report into Gaetz’s past conduct, including over an alleged sexual liaison with a minor that he has denied.
The controversy took another twist when a lawyer for two women who appeared before the committee said they testified that they were paid for “sexual favors” by the Florida Republican. The attorney, Joel Leppard, also told CNN’s Erin Burnett that one of the women told the committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with her then-underage friend in 2017. Gaetz denies any wrongdoing and the Justice Department did not press charges after its own investigation.

Trump is calling senators directly to lobby for Gaetz AG confirmation as House Republicans weigh burying ethics report on him
The Ethics Committee report has quickly become the first big crisis of the nascent second Trump administration. A small handful of Republican senators would be needed to defect in order to block Gaetz’s nomination when the party controls the Senate majority next year.
House Speaker Mike Johnson is insisting ahead of a scheduled meeting of the Ethics Committee on Wednesday that the report should not be released since Gaetz, following his resignation last week, is no longer a member of Congress.
The escalating drama is posing a critical question: How far will Trump go in trying to force Republican senators to back his choice — even though some have deep reservations about Gaetz’s character and qualifications for the job?
North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer, who wants to see the report released, addressed that exact issue on Monday and questioned the wisdom of the president-elect investing massive political capital in getting Gaetz confirmed.
“You have to, you know, determine whether or not the cost of getting them across the finish line is worth it, much less the possibility that you won’t get them across the finish line,” Cramer told CNN’s Manu Raju, while also raising concerns about Republicans cooperating with a recess appointment for Gaetz, as Trump demanded, if he cannot get enough votes.
GOP senators could pay a price for a prolonged confirmation fight
If Trump sticks with his pick, Republican senators feeling the MAGA movement’s pressure could be forced to defend Gaetz for weeks. That could land them in a tricky spot. Despite the threat that senators could face primaries if they break with the president-elect, votes for a compromised nominee could also haunt those seeking reelection in statewide races in 2026.
Cramer is raising logical political issues. Yet Trump is such a unique figure that the normal calculations may not apply.

Women testified to House panel that they were paid for sexual favors by Gaetz, lawyer says
Historically, a conventional president might see the uproar surrounding his pick, assess the shifting political sands and quietly withdraw support — reasoning that there’s little point in damaging their precious authority before their term even starts. Such political capital might be better spent on aggressively implementing an agenda in the first 100 days than on a pick who could already be doomed. In Trump’s case, sacrificing Gaetz could also ease the way for other provocative Cabinet picks, including Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth, whom Trump wants to serve as defense secretary, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine skeptic he wants to run the Health and Human Services Department. Senators might be just about ready to defy the president-elect on one selection, but a wholesale rejection of his choices would be political folly for them.
But Trump is also making this about far more than Gaetz, creating a test of power that reflects his own self-confidence, the balance of power in the new Congress and his belief that the GOP Senate should be at his service and not be a moderating force.
The president-elect’s unorthodox pick of the Florida Republican – and the muscle that he’s already put into his candidacy – means that Trump may soon approach the point where it will cost him more political capital to fold on Gaetz than to keep trying to get him installed – whatever it takes.
Ever since Trump shocked Capitol Hill and delighted his most committed supporters by selecting an ultra loyalist who has said the FBI should be abolished if it won’t “come to heel,” it’s been clear that this pick is different. The president-elect could have chosen just about anyone in Washington, and they would have been less controversial than Gaetz.
But the Florida Republican shares the president-elect’s belief that the Justice Department has victimized Trump and needs to be purged.
What the Gaetz showdown says about the new Washington
Trump also appears to be trying to establish an even more significant precedent. He is putting his credibility on the line in direct opposition to GOP senators’ commitment to perform their constitutional duty of “advise and consent” over Cabinet selections.
A president is generally given considerable deference over such picks. But it’s also normal for some presidential nominees to fall short. Former President Bill Clinton, for instance, considered two women for attorney general, Zoë Baird and Kimba Wood, who had to withdraw over allegations they had employed undocumented migrants as nannies.
Trump’s choices, however, mean this particular showdown will go a long way to shaping the political dynamics in Washington in the coming years, while establishing a fresh test for Republicans over whether they are willing to defy the new president, who takes names when he is thwarted.
If the president-elect can force Gaetz on the Justice Department despite the significant Senate concern, it will be fair to question whether the new GOP majority will oppose him on anything. And Trump, who has a history of forcing public officials to carry out his will, will increase Gaetz’s debt to him as he potentially sets about fulfilling Trump’s goals to seek retribution against his political foes.
Senators want to see Ethics report
Cramer’s comments go further than other Republicans on the Gaetz confirmation controversy. But there are signs that other GOP senators at least want more details about the allegations. Maine Sen. Susan Collins told CNN’s Raju that it would be “helpful” to see the House Ethics report.
And Texas Sen. John Cornyn insisted the Senate would fulfill its constitutional responsibility. “Whether we get the ethics report or not, the facts are going to come out one way or the other,” Cornyn said. “I would think it would be in everybody’s best interest, including the president’s, not to be surprised by some information that might come out during the confirmation hearing and the background check.”
Democrats argue that there is plenty of precedent for the release of an Ethics Committee report after a member has resigned, even though Johnson insists protocol requires such investigations to end once a lawmaker has left the chamber.

Tracking Trump’s picks for his Cabinet and administration
The top Democrat on the House committee — Rep. Susan Wild of Pennsylvania, who won’t be returning to Congress next year after losing her seat — told CNN that she believed that if the full committee did meet, “There will be a unanimous democratic consensus that the report should be released.”
But Johnson, who has previously said the report is not complete and insisted he hasn’t spoken to Trump about it despite spending significant time with him, dug in on Monday night, telling CNN’s Raju that this is a “different era” and “now we live in the age of the 24-hour news cycle, now we live in the age of social media, the politics and the dynamics are very different.”
CNN’s Kristen Holmes reported on Monday that the president-elect had been calling some senators directly to ask them to support Gaetz. Two sources familiar with the outreach didn’t say who the president-elect has spoken to but stressed his determination to get Gaetz in place at the Justice Department. The calls were first reported by Axios.
Before unveiling a slate of highly provocative picks, including Kennedy, Hegseth and his selection for Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, Trump had called on Republicans to push ahead with recess appointments if his picks for the Cabinet stalled. The president-elect is seeking to get a fast start to his second term and appears to be hoping to bypass the normal delays in assembling his team. It’s not unusual for presidents to use such a device for contested nominees. But it would be close to unprecedented for the Senate, which will be controlled by his party, to try to use such a tactic early in the confirmation process for multiple potential Cabinet officers, especially since Democrats could block efforts to recess.
And Cramer hinted that if Gaetz could not get confirmed with Republican votes, his position would be compromised. “I just think it’d be unwise to do that if he can’t get the votes of the majority party,” the North Dakota Republican said.

 — 
President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks are unique for many reasons. One thing that makes several of them stand out is that drug use from their recent or distant past is not a major issue, is overshadowed by other issues or is not currently raising a furor in an era when views of some drugs are evolving.
Alongside the investigation into whether Matt Gaetz had sex with an underage girl are reports of illicit drug use, all of which the former Florida congressman denies. It’s almost certain that he will be asked whether he has ever taken illegal drugs during Senate confirmation hearings for him to be the nation’s top attorney – a role in which he would oversee the Drug Enforcement Administration, among other agencies.

What questions do you have before Trump returns to the White House?
While Gaetz denies any drug use, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pleaded guilty to felony heroin possession in South Dakota in 1984, a grim chapter in his road to recovery. He openly talked about being an addict during the presidential campaign season.
Now an advocate for healthier food, Kennedy wants to “Make America Healthy Again” as Trump’s pick for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. But his vaccine skepticism has gotten more attention than his past. A classmate at Harvard University, the author Kurt Andersen, wrote in The Atlantic earlier this year that he bought cocaine from Kennedy while the two were students.
Kennedy brings his addiction worldview to prescription drugs such as those overseen by the Food and Drug Administration, which he would oversee if confirmed as HHS secretary. Of the popular weight loss drug Ozempic, for instance, Kennedy said on Fox News recently that pharmaceutical companies are “counting on selling it to Americans because we’re so stupid and so addicted to drugs.”
Elon Musk, meanwhile, has been tapped to co-lead the “Department of Government Efficiency.” While that isn’t an official Cabinet position, Musk’s companies are on the receiving end of billions in government contracts. He openly talks about his prescription use of ketamine, the drug many Americans likely first heard of with the death of actor Matthew Perry last year.
After smoking marijuana in public during a live interview for Joe Rogan’s podcast in 2018, Musk said he agreed to undergo random drug testing for three years at the request of NASA, which pays billions of taxpayer dollars to Musk’s SpaceX. But Musk denied allegations of past drug use as reported in The Wall Street Journal early this year.
Federal employees are barred from taking illegal drugs, and there are no reports to indicate that any of Trump’s Cabinet or other administration picks are using illegal drugs.
It is not unprecedented for Trump to hire people known to use drugs in the past. In Trump’s first term, his top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, had a history of drug use and had talked about his many years of sobriety. Kudlow is not angling for a role in Trump’s second term.
CNN has reported that this year, Trump’s team is bypassing long and cumbersome FBI background checks for some of his Cabinet picks. Ultimately, it’s up to Trump, as president, to decide who he shares information with, according to CNN’s report.
Past drug use was a major issue used by Republicans against the Biden White House, because the president’s son, Hunter, had faced addiction, which helped fuel behavior that led to federal gun and tax charges. But note that Hunter Biden is not a Cabinet-level official in the administration, nor has he had any official role.
Trump, meanwhile, is a teetotaler and has said he never took drugs, had a drink of alcohol or smoked. He talked in depth about watching his brother, Fred, descend into alcoholism during an August appearance on Theo Von’s “This Past Weekend” podcast.

Trump seemed interested by Von’s discussion of his own addiction and what it’s like to take drugs. “Cocaine will turn you into a damn owl, homie, you know what I’m saying?” Von told Trump.
In terms of policy, Von sounded adjacent to Kennedy when he complained of lobbyists for pharmaceutical companies – something on which Trump didn’t offer in-depth thoughts. He also did not mention that it was his Department of Justice during his first term that negotiated a controversial deal with the Sackler family that was recently struck down by the Supreme Court. The Sacklers are the family behind Purdue Pharma, the company that developed OxyContin, a highly addictive drug.
Trump has been on both sides of how to address the nation’s drug problems and opioid epidemic. In one video, he both bragged about his efforts as president to help people in the throes of addiction but also promised to greatly expand use of the death penalty for drug dealers.
He has promised to pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping to cut down on the flow of ingredients used to make fentanyl out of China and into Mexico. That has also been a priority of the Biden administration. Trump has focused his pledge to shut the US border both as something that is required to stem the tide of undocumented immigrants as well as to fight cartels flooding the US with deadly fentanyl.
Trump voted along with more than 55% of voters in Florida this month in favor of legalizing both marijuana and psychedelics for recreational purposes. It was a position that put him in opposition to Republican leaders in the state. In Florida, state constitutional amendments require 60% of the vote to pass, and the measure was defeated by a 44% minority of voters.
There is one drug-related item on which Joe Biden and Trump agree. When he endorsed Florida’s failed marijuana amendment, Trump said he would carry on with the process, begun by the Biden administration, of reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous substance in the eyes of the federal government.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-drugs-what-matters/index.html
201,General Politics,2024,11,Trump doubles down on provocative Cabinet picks as their fates hang in the balance,Stephen Collinson,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump is refusing to back down over his Cabinet picks in the first clash in an epic battle he will wage against Washington when he takes office next year.
The coming days will show whether Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard, Pete Hegseth and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have staying power for confirmation fights in the new Republican Senate over their assignments to safeguard the rule of law, the US intelligence community, the military, and the health and well-being of all Americans.
Each of the most provocative selections is facing criticism that they lack the expertise and experience to run the vast, specialized bureaucracies that would be under their control.
And debate over their prospects is intensifying following fresh revelations and allegations about their pasts, which will set up a test for Trump’s intention to wield what he regards as almost uncheckable power from the Oval Office.

Trump’s defense secretary nominee paid accuser but denies sexual assault, attorney says
CNN reported this weekend that Hegseth, Trump’s pick for defense secretary, paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault in a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause, according to Hegseth’s attorney. The Fox News anchor has denied assaulting the woman, according to the attorney, and was not charged in any criminal case or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit in connection with the 2017 incident. The initial sexual assault allegation against Hegseth had caught Trump’s team off guard last week, after the president-elect had already picked him.
Intrigue also deepened over a House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz, the potential attorney general, after a lawyer who represents two of the witnesses in the probe said Friday that one of his clients saw the Florida Republican, who resigned from Congress last week, having sex with a minor. Gaetz denies any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex. He was not charged after a Department of Justice investigation.
There is also growing scrutiny over Gabbard’s suitability for the job of director of national intelligence because of her positions that sometimes amplified the propaganda of one of the covert community’s top adversaries — Russia.
And some senior medical experts are raising concerns over the qualifications of Kennedy, a vaccine skeptic, to safeguard generations of medical advances as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, even though his outspokenness against processed food has found support among many top physicians.
Not all of Trump’s picks are causing uproar. The selection of Florida Sen. Marco Rubio to serve as secretary of state has won praise on both sides of the aisle. But in a conventional administration, controversies raging around at least four key Cabinet picks would be seen as a disaster.
Trump is adamant he’s not going to give in as he seeks people who will fulfill his goals of tearing down the Washington establishment in a second term he pledged to devote to retribution. A source told CNN over the weekend that Trump sees Gaetz as his most important pick. The president-elect wants the former Florida congressman confirmed “100%,” the source said. “He is not going to back off. He’s all in.”
Johnson tells CNN that releasing Gaetz ethics report would open a Pandora’s box’
Trump has called on the Senate to, if necessary, cooperate with him to make recess appointments if the picks cannot be confirmed. Using such a move as a first resort rather than a final one, as has happened in the past, would be a sign that Trump, with a compliant GOP, plans to bypass the constitutional checks and balances of Congress and act with sweeping, unrestrained authority as president.
The outcome of the coming showdown will depend on whether Republican senators are willing to abrogate their own power to vet nominees and will cave under the furious political pressure that is certain to be trained on them by the “Make America Great Again” movement. The issue represents the first political crisis to confront South Dakota Sen. John Thune, who will take over as Republican Senate majority leader next year. And even if senators take a stand over one or two nominees they view as unqualified, it’s unlikely they will deal a defeat to the new president by throwing out all of the most provocative picks, meaning that some of them are almost certain to take jobs atop key government departments.

As attorney general, Gaetz would go from being under DOJ scrutiny to leading the nation’s top law enforcement agency
The storm over Trump’s picks is deepening as the president-elect is working to complete his future governing team with positions such as treasury secretary and US trade representative — who will be critical to carrying out his populist trade and economic policies — still outstanding.
Gaetz — a pyrotechnical politician who made his name with his outspoken support for Trump and a series of political stunts — is attracting the most attention in part because of his decision to quit the House just days before the Ethics Committee was expected to release its report. Without him being a sitting member of Congress, the investigation will end with the report still under wraps, despite some GOP senators requesting to see what is in it.
House Speaker Mike Johnson told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday that releasing the report would open a “Pandora’s box” since Gaetz had left Congress, even though such action would not be unprecedented. “The Senate has a role, the advise-and-consent role, under the Constitution, and they will perform it,” the Louisiana Republican said. “They will have a rigorous review and vetting process in the Senate, but they don’t need to rely upon a report, or a draft report, a rough draft report, that was prepared by the Ethics Committee for its very limited purposes.” Johnson also said he had not discussed the matter with Trump.

The president-elect’s son explains the plan
Gaetz and several other Trump picks have caused consternation in some circles given the questions about their qualifications and past behavior.
“I think the whole point with these nominees, several of them, is their un-qualification, is their affirmative disqualification,” Sen.-elect Adam Schiff said on “State of the Union” on Sunday. “That’s Trump’s point, because what he wants to do with these nominees is establish that the Congress of the United States will not stand up to him with anything,” the California Democrat said. “If they will confirm Matt Gaetz, they will do anything he wants.”
Rep. Jim Himes, a Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warned Sunday that Republican senators should look to their legacies and not to Trump. “These people are manifestly unqualified, and they’re not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they have been asked to run,” the Connecticut Democrat said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” He added: “A Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz — a chaos agent, a performative social media, no-respect-for-the-rule-of-law individual — the Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.”

Trump is determined to see Gaetz confirmed as AG despite controversies
Trump on the campaign trail made no secret of his plans if he won a second term. Many of his most committed supporters regard the federal government as a liberal deep state that has failed to respond to their needs. Trump, moreover, is still seething over the establishment’s attempts to rein him in during his first White House term. So selecting Cabinet picks who are seen as unqualified to lead their departments may be an attempt to deal a blow against the credibility of government in itself.
The strategy was explained by the president-elect’s son Donald Trump Jr. on “Sunday Morning Futures” on Fox Business. “The reality this time is, we actually know what we’re doing. We actually know who the good guys and the bad guys are. We know who the guys who are fake,” he said. “It’s about surrounding my father with people who are both competent and loyal. They will deliver on his promises. They will deliver on his message. They are not people who think they know better, as unelected bureaucrats.”
Trump Jr. also suggested that the uproar surrounding some of Trump’s picks was exactly why he chose them and that it proves their authenticity. “A lot of them are going to face pushback, for the same reasons. Again, they are going to be actual disrupters. That’s what the American people want.”
It would take a handful of Republican senators to block the most provocative Trump nominees early next year, given that Democrats are likely to vote en masse against them. But several GOP senators made clear Sunday they had no problems with the people Trump has picked to staff the government.
Sen. Markwayne Mullin has a long-standing personal feud with Gaetz and has in the past held his behavior in contempt. But the Oklahoma Republican said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that he would give Gaetz a “fair shot.” He added: “I’ve got a tough situation. … I’ve got to set my personal situation with Matt to the side and look at the facts. If he’s qualified, he’s qualified.”
Missouri Sen. Eric Schmitt said he believed Trump’s nominees would get confirmed. “You have to have people you trust to go into these agencies and have a real reform agenda. And that’s why I think there’s real momentum, real momentum to get these nominations confirmed,” he said on “Sunday Morning Futures.”
On the same show, however, another Trump ally, Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville, warned there was “hard work” ahead in the confirmation process but praised Gaetz as a “fighter” who was loyal to the president-elect. “We have got the numbers. Let’s step to the plate, do our job, because we have to get this country back going in the right direction. President Trump only has a short period of time. Four years is not long.”
Across the aisle, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman looked ahead to those four years and urged Democrats to acknowledge the big picture rather than playing into Trump’s hands over every controversy. He said on “State of the Union” that the picks of Gaetz and some others were “just absolute trolls” that fit Trump’s purposes. “He gets the kind of thing that he wanted, like the freak-out. … If we’re having meltdowns every tweet or every appointment or all those things, I mean, it’s going to be four years.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/politics/trump-provocative-cabinet-picks-analysis/index.html

 — 
“Impoundment” is another word that Americans may need to learn in the vernacular of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term.
If “recess appointments” are the unlikely and unprecedented way Trump wants to work around the Senate to get his most controversial nominees in charge of Cabinet agencies, “impoundment” is the unlikely way he envisions shrinking the federal government with or without congressional approval.
Trump took the time to record a video about impoundment during the Republican primary season, and he promised seizing control over spending from Congress would be a top priority if he was elected.
What is impoundment?
The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. But the president is in charge of executing the law. Impoundment occurs when Congress appropriates money that the president then declines to spend.
It occurred frequently in US history, beginning in 1803 when Thomas Jefferson declined to buy gunboats to patrol the Mississippi as he negotiated the Louisiana Purchase with France.
What happened to impoundment?
Richard Nixon abused the privilege, at least according to Congress at the time. After his reelection in 1972, Nixon planned to use impoundment to achieve sweeping policy aims, according to the Congressional Research Service. He wanted to halt federal housing programs, reduce disaster aid and more.
When Congress overrode his veto of the Clean Water Act of 1972, he used the power of impoundment to refuse to spend a good portion of the $24 billion in funds meant to help clean sewage out of municipal water systems.
As a result of these standoffs, Congress passed a law to curtail a president’s use of impoundment, particularly for policy reasons. The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 did a lot more than that, however. It was passed alongside legislation that created the Congressional Budget Office, the official nonpartisan accountant on Capitol Hill, and also the House and Senate budget committees.
Trump has tried impounding funds before
Trump tried to defy the impoundment law during his first term as president by withholding funds to Ukraine as he pressured President Volodymyr Zelensky to help engineer an investigation into Joe Biden.
If that sounds familiar, it’s because that pressure led to Trump’s first impeachment by Democrats in Congress. The funds were ultimately released, and the Government Accountability Office argued that the Trump administration broke the law by withholding the aid.
What did Trump say before he was elected?
In one of the videos he recorded to outline his second-term agenda, Trump said reclaiming the power of impoundment would be a top priority, either through the courts or by getting Congress to give up its power.
RELATED ARTICLE
Here’s what Trump has promised to do in a second term
The Impoundment Control Act of 1974, in Trump’s telling, is “not a very good act; this disaster of a law is clearly unconstitutional, a blatant violation of the separation of powers.”
After he reclaims this power, Trump said, “I will then use the president’s long recognized impoundment power to squeeze the bloated federal bureaucracy for massive savings.”
There will be obstacles. It does not take a leap of faith to guess that even many Republican lawmakers may not want to cede the power of the purse back to the White House.
Trump might think he’ll fare well challenging impoundment at the Supreme Court, which now leans to the right and is skeptical of the federal bureaucracy. The court recently curtailed the power of agencies to interpret statutes passed by Congress. That could also be read as a warning against executive overreach.
What about more revolutionary reform?
Another Republican who has talked about repealing the Impoundment Control Act is Vivek Ramaswamy, the Ohio businessman whom Trump tapped along with Elon Musk to lead the new “Department of Government Efficiency.”
Despite its official sounding name, DOGE – named to cross-promote Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency – is an extra-governmental initiative offering suggestions on how to engage in a massive shrinkage of the size of government, but with no authority to execute them.
RELATED ARTICLE
Trump wants Elon Musk to overhaul the government. Here’s what could be on the chopping block
Impoundment could be a key tool in their plans. As a Republican presidential candidate, Ramaswamy said a president actually has untold power to go much further simply by reimagining other existing laws.
He said a president could simply argue for efficiency and cost savings and reinterpret federal employment law to engage in a mass layoff of half the federal workforce within a year. Up to 75% of federal workers could be fired within four years, according to Ramaswamy during the Republican primary. That would be the firing of more than a million federal workers.
“Do we want incremental reform, or do we want revolution?” Ramaswamy said.
Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump’s pick to be attorney general, was in the front row at a 2023 speech in Washington where Ramaswamy laid out his plan to reinterpret existing law. The men agree about the idea of shutting down the ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Ramaswamy, citing his new view of a law passed in 1977 and signed by then-President Jimmy Carter that references a president’s authority to determine changes to agencies, would also obliterate the FBI, the Department of Education and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, among others. It’s a heterodox view of the scope of presidential power, to say the least.
It’s not at all clear that Trump shares Ramaswamy’s view of nixing all of these agencies. Even if he did, there would be lawsuits if Trump took Ramaswamy’s advice to simply end the FBI. That would be an interesting political argument to watch unfold after Republicans complained that Democrats wanted to defund the police.
This is the big-think mindset Ramaswamy could bring to DOGE. Trump clearly wants big ideas as he tries to reimagine the US government.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/politics/donald-trump-impoundment-congress-what-matters/index.html

 — 
For all the drama generated every four years by Cabinet appointments, defeat of a nominee by a vote in the Senate is extremely rare.
The only time a nominee by a new president was rejected by a Senate vote occurred in 1989, when George H.W. Bush nominated John Tower, a former senator from Texas, to be his secretary of defense.
Tower was undone by stories of his excessive drinking and what press reports at the time referred to as “womanizing,” and which Pentagon files back then documented as placing “special attention on the secretaries” as an arms negotiator in Geneva.
Tower was the subject of an FBI investigation into drinking and sexual harassment, part of a security clearance check. Compare that situation with Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be attorney general. Gaetz was once the subject of a federal investigation for sex trafficking by the Department of Justice – the same agency Trump wants him to lead. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and says he’s innocent. But the FBI files, which have never been released, seem likely to come up at his confirmation hearing.
RELATED ARTICLE
Tracking Trump’s picks for his Cabinet and administration
Perhaps Trump’s nomination of Gaetz will test the yearslong streak of no Cabinet nominee being rejected by the Senate. Former House colleagues have said Gaetz bragged about sex with an underage girl. Plus, he has earned the enmity of some of his Republican colleagues, although Trump’s influence could overcome all of that.
Or maybe it will be Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine skeptic Trump is tapping to head the Department of Health and Human Services. Kennedy has a history of drug use, although it’s rarely mentioned these days.
Rather than face the humiliation of a rejection vote in the Senate, Cabinet nominees are more frequently withdrawn when it becomes clear they cannot be confirmed. Every recent president since Bill Clinton has withdrawn at least one of their initial nominees. Clinton’s initial nominee to be attorney general, Zoe Baird, withdrew her nomination after admitting she employed undocumented immigrants to watch her child.
Here’s a look at the Cabinet confirmation process, why it exists, where it’s gone wrong and how Trump wants to find a way around it.
What is the Cabinet?
Presidents lead the federal government with the help of a group of close advisers and the heads of federal agencies like the Department of Justice and the Pentagon. Some members of the Cabinet, like vice president and White House chief of staff, do not need Senate approval. But most of them do.
Some roles, like US ambassador to the United Nations or CIA director, have been at the Cabinet level in some administrations but not all. The current Cabinet, under President Joe Biden, has 26 members.
Why does the Senate get a say in who works for the president?
Article II is the section of the Constitution that deals with the executive branch. In Section II, it makes clear that while the president is the executive, he hires certain positions spelled out in the Constitution and others established by law with the “advice and consent” of senators. If the Senate is in recess, the president can make temporary appointments.
Here’s what it says in the Constitution:
He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.
The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.
How many people does the president nominate in total?
A lot! The Partnership for Public Service tracks about 1,200 positions, most well below the Cabinet level, that require Senate approval – although the president probably does not have a personal role in most of those. They are handled by his staff or the newly confirmed heads of agencies.
Some positions can go an entire presidency without a nominee. The process has also gotten much slower in recent years.
How does the nomination and confirmation process work?
In modern times, a president-elect nominates his picks for top officials ASAP after winning the election. Planning should ideally begin before Election Day.
Oversight committees in the Senate can conduct confirmation hearings before Inauguration Day on January 20. They can refer nominees to the full Senate or quick votes when the new president takes the oath of office. But things frequently take a lot longer.
How long does a nomination take?
Longer than it used to. Even after Democratic senators pushed through changes to the rules in 2013 to remove the filibuster from confirmation of administration officials, the two parties have gotten more adversarial about the process.
When the elder Bush assumed office in January 1989, senators had already confirmed seven of his 15 nominees, according to the Partnership for Public Service. When Trump started his first term, he had two confirmations for 26 nominees. When Biden took office in 2021, he had one confirmation for 36 nominees. The slowness continues.
The three presidents before Trump’s first term all had more than 200 nominees confirmed by 200 days in office. Trump had 119 and Biden had 118 confirmed nominees at that point, although Trump had nominated far fewer people than other presidents.
Is there a way around the nomination process?
Sort of. There is that mention in the Constitution of recess appointments – something Trump has said he wants to use.
While his fellow Republicans who will control the Senate in January have not rejected the idea, leaders like Sen. John Thune also clearly don’t want to give away their power over oversight. Plus, recess appointments only last until the end of the next Senate session, usually around the calendar year.
Trump, frustrated with the process during his first term, appointed multiple people to be “acting” heads of agencies, but they can only serve in that capacity for a matter of months, according to law. There are also limits on who can be made an acting secretary.
Why doesn’t every president use recess appointments?
Presidents like Ronald Reagan, Clinton and both Bushes did use recess appointments, although usually for positions below the Cabinet level. Only three Cabinet secretaries have been appointed during a recess since 1900, according to the Senate Historical Office. The most recent was Mickey Kantor, who served briefly as Clinton’s secretary of commerce.
When Barack Obama used recess appointments to make the National Labor Relations Board function, he was sued. The US Supreme Court ruled it takes at least a 10-day recess to justify a recess appointment.
So that was the end of recess appointments?
So far, yes. Senators have simply stopped taking long recesses. The last 10-day recess they adjourned for was in 2016, according to records kept by the Senate Historical Office. Instead, they will take short breaks, and a single senator can enter the chamber every few days for a “pro forma” session during which no business is typically conducted.
Could Senate Republicans just take a recess and let Trump appoint a Cabinet?
Technically, yes.
While Democrats can no longer filibuster Cabinet nominees, they can slow the process down. It’s possible Republicans could decide to adjourn for a long recess, but it would be an incredible abdication of power by GOP leaders. It would certainly be the subject of a lawsuit, and there’s some evidence a conservative Supreme Court would be skeptical of an effort to fill Trump’s Cabinet in a manufactured recess.
Is there a loophole?
There is another clause in the Constitution that some Trump allies are looking at. The House and Senate are each given the power to adjourn, but for anything longer than three days, they need each chamber’s approval. If the House and Senate can’t agree, the Constitution says this about the president:
… he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper …
So if Senate Republicans don’t want to give up their power, it is technically possible that House Speaker Mike Johnson could get the House to pass an adjournment resolution the Senate would not agree to. Trump could then adjourn the Senate for 10 days to ram through a Cabinet.
Let’s explore that. Johnson is set to have a very slim majority. He’d need every House Republican to go along with him in a quest to declare parliamentary war on a Republican-controlled Senate. Seems extremely unlikely to happen. But who knows.
The president has never in US history tried to adjourn the House and Senate using this authority. The Senate Historical Office said it was not aware of serious discussion about this particular clause in the Constitution since the 1930s.
The conservative legal expert Edward Whelan writes about this idea in The Washington Post and encourages Johnson to shoot it down.
Who was the first Cabinet nominee to be rejected?
The first Cabinet officer to be rejected was Roger B. Taney, who then-President Andrew Jackson wanted as Treasury secretary in 1834 to gut the Second Bank of the United States, the precursor to the Federal Reserve. (Trump, coincidentally, would like to exert more power over the Federal Reserve today.)
Senators rejected Taney even after he served in the post temporarily, according to an account by the Senate Historical Office.
Then, the Senate rejected Taney when Jackson put him forward for a Supreme Court nomination. Jackson then put Taney forward again, but this time for chief justice of the Supreme Court. Taney was ultimately confirmed and, as chief justice, swore in Jackson’s hand-picked successor, Martin Van Buren, who, coincidently, the Senate had rejected as Jackson’s ambassador to England.
Taney, appointed for life to the Supreme Court, was ultimately an epic historical villain. He wrote the Dred Scott decision, which ruled that Black Americans could never be citizens.

 — 
Each of Donald Trump’s most provocative Cabinet picks has been a calculated punch in the mouth to experts, elites and bureaucrats in Washington’s government agencies.
But his decision to let Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic and conspiracy theorist, “go wild” on health and medicines as health and human services secretary is his most shocking attempt yet at an anti-establishment tear-down.
The president-elect’s previous selections for director of national intelligence, attorney general and defense secretary could change the country and the world in the long term. Their effect, however, would be distant for most Americans.

Trump picks Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to be his Department of Health and Human Services secretary
If Kennedy gets an opportunity as the country’s top health official to promote his past claims that vaccines are not safe and effective or to act on his desire to fire 600 people at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees many facets of health research, including vaccines, he could have a more immediate impact on the lives of millions of Americans. If for instance his advice or ideas led to a lowering of the penetration of vaccines in the US population, a significant number of lives could be at risk.
Kennedy has some views that top physicians welcome, including his calls for processed foods to be removed from school lunches and his warnings that the food industry is marketing products that increase a chronic disease crisis. But the president-elect’s decision to put RFK Jr. in charge of the health of 350 million Americans, despite his stances on vaccines that contradict the science-based research of most scientists and medical experts, is likely to ignite a new debate about the potential real-world implications of the second Trump term that will begin in January.

03:39 - Source: CNN
Some of Trump’s MAGA dream team can be best explained by a former president grinding an ax against agencies and institutions that he believes thwarted his first term. But Kennedy’s ascendency and apparently long political leash goes far beyond a Trumpian retribution quest. It could impact the medicines Americans use, the treatments and drug therapies that are approved, the inoculations used to protect the country’s school kids from diseases like measles and the food that everyone eats.
The US Department of Health and Human Services secretary has a massive platform and huge power to influence the information that Americans have and the choices they make. If Kennedy is confirmed and another pathogen emerges and causes a pandemic in the next four years, he will be in charge of fighting it.
‘People like you, Bobby’
Kennedy was seen at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in black tie on Thursday night, hours after an announcement that sent despair and concern coursing through the medical community.
The president-elect lauded his selection during a speech. “I guess if you like health and you like people who live a long time, it is the most important position,” Trump said. “I just looked at the news reports. People like you, Bobby. We want you to come up with things and ideas and what you have been talking about for a long time.”
Kennedy’s selection came after the president-elect picked controversial congressman Matt Gaetz to be attorney general, aiming a blow at the legal institutions that tried to hold him to account for his attempt to steal the 2020 election. Generals who Trump thinks blocked him during his first term may end up working for Fox News star Pete Hegseth, who thinks there is a “woke” war against American warriors and is in line to be defense secretary. And Trump took out his fury against the intelligence “deep state” by naming Tulsi Gabbard, who met Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and is a favorite of Russian propaganda TV, as America’s top spy.
These picks have caused uproar in Washington.
But they are seen very differently by millions of Trump voters who think the capital’s establishment is rotten and has let them down. And they are symptomatic of a president-elect who is returning to power with very few constraints and is showing he plans to behave aggressively in a term he said on the campaign trail would be devoted to retribution against his opponents.

Trump believes he has a mandate for his unorthodox choices
So far, Republicans have responded to critics of Trump’s burn-Washington-down approach with a simple argument: He has a mandate.
For instance, CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Indiana Sen.-elect Jim Banks whether he was concerned about Kennedy’s false claims that vaccines can cause autism. “Look Jake, in the election, Donald Trump won the popular vote,” Banks said. “And one of the things he promised on the campaign trail is to have a serious and thoughtful conversations about vaccines, especially after the pandemic.”
It’s true that Trump made no secret on the campaign trail of his intention to hand significant power to Kennedy to overhaul health institutions. And the entire subtext of his campaign was a vow to blow up the Washington consensus.
The president-elect has long resented the science and expert class in the US government, especially dating from their advice during the Covid-19 pandemic — an emergency that Trump repeatedly downplayed — that conflicted with his desire to get the economy open again in his reelection year. Other Americans chafed at mask wearing and many conservative states resisted federal government advice on the pandemic on matters like school closures and lockdowns.
But despite Trump’s victory this year, in which he won all seven battleground states, the US basically remains a 50-50 nation, and it’s debatable whether the president-elect truly has a mandate to destroy generations of policy and institutional orthodoxy — especially in areas like health.

‘An extraordinarily bad choice’
Kennedy does have some views that would find favor in the medical establishment, especially concerning his efforts to address unhealthy diets in the US that cause chronic and noncommunicable diseases that could mostly be prevented. He has said he’d “immediately” begin studying vaccine safety and efficacy but promised not to “take vaccines away from anybody.” He also committed to formally recommending states and municipalities remove fluoride from public water.
Kennedy also says he wants to return a gold standard of science to a health sector he believes is skewed by massive pharmaceutical companies. But his long record of misinformation and selective use of data on vaccines is directly in conflict with the consensus among scientists and medical experts.
“I think this is an extraordinarily bad choice,” Dr. Ashish Jha, a former Biden administration Covid-19 coordinator and the dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. Previous HHS secretaries in both Republican and Democratic administrations have allowed scientists in agencies under their oversight to make determinations, Jha said. “RFK Jr. has given us all the signals that he does not plan to do that, he does not plan to lean on evidence and rigorous analysis to make decisions but instead to use his own ideas.”
Another health expert and former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention acting director condemned the pick. “Frankly, I find it chilling,” said Dr. Richard Besser. Besser, who practiced pediatrics, warned that Kennedy’s views on child vaccines were dangerous, telling CNN’s Kaitlan Collins: “He has done so much to undermine the confidence that people have in that incredible intervention.”
Kennedy’s selection was made public on the same day that the World Health Organization and the CDC — an agency that would be under RFK Jr.’s purview — said global measles cases surged by more than 20% to an estimated 10.3 million last year. The highly contagious disease is preventable with two doses of the measles vaccine that most Americans get as kids.
In the US, a dip in vaccination rates among kindergartners has coincided with a period in which some conservative politicians in particular have fueled skepticism about vaccines following the Covid-19 pandemic. As of November, 266 measles cases have been reported this year with 16 outbreaks.
CDC Director Dr. Mandy Cohen told CNN’s Meg Tirrell on Wednesday that childhood vaccines were the way to make the country as healthy as possible. “I think we have a very short memory of what it is like to hold a child who has been paralyzed with polio or to comfort a mom who’s lost her kid from measles,” Cohen said at the Milken Institute’s Future of Health Summit.
Kennedy has denied he is a vaccine skeptic. But on Lex Fridman’s podcast last year, he said that “there is no vaccine that is, you know, safe and effective,” and in December 2023, he told CNN’s Kasie Hunt he “would be against mandates” for children in public schools.
Another pick adds to growing pressure on Senate Republicans
The latest controversial Trump Cabinet pick escalated one of the first dramas of the Trump second term — the question of whether all of them will get confirmed by the Senate.
Serious doubt was already swirling around Gaetz, who was himself under investigation by the FBI and was the subject of a House Ethics Committee probe before he officially resigned from the House of Representatives on Wednesday. And Kennedy’s entry into the mix will present another challenge for Republican senators who don’t have much of a record of standing up to the president-elect.
It would take a handful of Republican lawmakers to defect in order to imperil the confirmation of a Trump pick – and his control of the GOP has never been stronger after he mounted the greatest comeback in US political history and reclaimed the White House.

They might be influenced by members who plan to retire at the midterms, and may be less beholden to Trump, or the new influx of senators just elected who won’t have to run for reelection until two years after his term ends.

 — 
Donald Trump’s increasingly provocative Cabinet picks have left some Republican senators aghast and Washington in shock.
But they really shouldn’t. Because the outrage is the point.
The president-elect reached a new level on Wednesday, announcing Florida Republican Matt Gaetz — one of his most zealous agents of disruption, who, like him, was once investigated by the Justice Department — as his pick for attorney general.
Tulsi Gabbard, the one-time Democratic presidential candidate, who now shares Trump’s belief that the intelligence community has been weaponized against him, will be America’s new top spy, if confirmed as director of national intelligence.
The latest selections for Trump’s MAGA dream team caused such a stir that they almost overshadowed the pick of Fox News anchor Pete Hegseth to serve as defense secretary on Tuesday night.

But they are perfectly in tune with Trump’s campaign trail promises and political project. The dismay engulfing establishment elites contrasted with the euphoria rocketing through conservative networks and social media among Trump fans. The president-elect draws political strength from his position as an outsider scourge of the establishment, and if his picks are confirmed by the Senate — a huge if in the case of Gaetz — they will be tasked with his mission of defenestrating government and driving out those Trump sees as enemies.
Trump won the election and has a mandate for change. And these and other picks are proof of a president-elect who is increasingly powerful and cares little for the critics who warn his second term poses a threat to the rule of law.
‘God-tier trolling’
Trump’s short-lived former first-term communications director Anthony Scaramucci told CNN’s Jake Tapper that the president-elect’s personnel selections were purposely meant to “own the liberals.” Paraphrasing Trump’s intent, he added: “‘Let’s pick some triggering people.’ And those are the triggering people.”
Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. John Fetterman agreed, telling CNN’s Manu Raju of the Gaetz selection: “It’s just kind of like a god-tier, kind of trolling, just to trigger a meltdown.”
Gaetz — who had been under a House Ethics Committee investigation — resigned from Congress on Wednesday in the wake of Trump’s announcement. The committee, which had been probing allegations that he “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct” — was due to meet this week to vote on releasing a report, potentially as soon as Friday, CNN reported. But with Gaetz leaving, it’s unclear if the information will ever become public. The Florida Republican has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex. The Justice Department, which had pursued a yearslong sex-crimes investigation into him, ultimately decided last year not to pursue criminal charges against Gaetz.
Millions of the president-elect’s voters agree that his own legal troubles are not the result of criminal wrongdoing but of years of victimization by the Justice Department. They think the Russia investigation in his first term was hatched by the intelligence agencies to destroy him. Trump voters want entire layers of government bureaucrats fired, think regulations contribute to their own economic problems, worry about millions of border crossings by undocumented migrants and oppose Pentagon diversity programs. Trump is their agent of change. And his lightning bolt picks for top government jobs are his lieutenants in that effort.
Hegseth, Gaetz and Gabbard pose questions about Trump’s motivations and the direction of his second administration that begins on January 20, not least because of their professional, ethical or experiential qualities, or lack of them.

GOP Senator responds to criticism on Trump’s secretary of defense pick

Is Trump looking for an attorney general to ensure the administering of fair justice? If so, would he have chosen Gaetz, who had been under investigation? But the president-elect’s intentions were clear in his announcement of his intent to nominate him: “Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System.” Trump’s statement seems to play into his long-term aspiration to find an attorney general who defends him and targets his enemies.
Gaetz was a leading proponent of Trump’s attempts to steal the 2020 election and has called for the abolition of the FBI, the DOJ and other agencies unless they “come to heel.” In this light, the Gaetz pick seems most like a gesture of contempt for the Justice Department, the prosecutors who work there and the rule of law.
“This is an outrageous pick. There is no way around it,” CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, a former assistant US attorney, said on CNN International.
News that Hegseth had been picked to lead the Pentagon rocked Washington the night before the Gaetz pick and sparked similar questions about Trump’s motives. The Fox News star has a military record marked by valor after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he has little of the deep experience in high-level strategy, international diplomacy and national security that is normally required of those in charge of the planet’s most powerful military. He, therefore, risks being outmatched on a call with a grizzled Russian or Chinese defense minister if he was called upon to defuse a sudden crisis. But Hegseth’s years on Fox demonstrate that he’s highly qualified to lead a culture war inside the Defense Department given his condemnation of diversity programs, women serving in combat and advocacy for Trump to free service personnel accused of war crimes.
Gabbard also has a distinguished military record. But she appears to have been picked to lead the DNI because of her suspicions of the covert community as Trump seeks to clean out what he calls “corrupt actors” he views as disloyal. Among the former Hawaii congresswoman’s many clashes with the US intelligence community are her doubts that Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad was guilty of war crimes after a chemical weapons attack. And she was accused of “parroting” false propaganda from America’s premier espionage adversary, Russia, by no less than Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney.
Not all Trump’s picks are contentious. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, his selection for secretary of state, has drawn skepticism over his conversion to Trump’s America Firstism, but many of his fellow senators regard him as a serious thinker on foreign affairs, especially on China. And the president-elect has earned the right to choose who he wants to help him fulfill his mandate.
But like most of Trump’s other staff picks, Gabbard, Hegseth and Gaetz share several things in common. They are unfailingly loyal to the president-elect. They are all avid proponents of the stunt politics that he pioneered as a social media provocateur. And if the 45th and 47th president is intent, as he says, on a second term of “retribution” — they look like they may be willing to honor his orders.

The next shoes to drop?
There was a growing sense in Washington on Wednesday night that with the Gaetz pick at least, Trump may have overreached for the first time as president-elect, even with normally supportive Republicans.
One of his few GOP critics, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski called the Florida Republican an “unserious candidate” when asked by CNN about his chances for confirmation. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, another rare Republican Trump critic, said she was “shocked” to hear the news and noted there would be an extensive background check by the FBI over the impending nomination. Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst said that Gaetz “is going to have a lot of work to do.”
The Gaetz selection created an immediate crisis for South Dakota Sen. John Thune, hours after he won the leadership of the incoming Republican majority. Thune is certain to come under severe pressure from the president-elect to ensure that Gaetz is seated at the Justice Department.

The former and future president’s allies were already rallying around Gaetz and warning of consequences should he be blocked by the Senate conducting its constitutional role of advise and consent. “I love Matt Gaetz,” Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said, warning that it would be risky for senators to vote against him.” He added, “We got all 53 Republicans — you’re going to tell me that one Republican is going to vote against one of Trump’s team? If that happens, it ought to blow us all up. It’s crazy,” Tuberville said. (CNN has not yet projected the Pennsylvania Senate race, which is headed to a recount, leaving the GOP at 52 seats.)
A president-elect who feels liberated from constraints after his election victory may not yet be finished rocking the boat with positions yet to be announced, including secretaries of the Treasury and Health and Human Services. It is no wonder Trump started this week demanding GOP senators acquiesce to his demands for recess appointments for nominees if they cannot win swift confirmation.

 — 
President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks keep getting more outlandish, which may be part of the point.
Attorney general? Rep. Matt Gaetz, the right-wing provocateur who is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct.
Secretary of defense? Pete Hegseth, a weekend Fox News host who served in the Army National Guard.
Director of national intelligence? Tulsi Gabbard, the former Democratic congresswoman who has expressed sympathy for Russia.
“Some of them are designed to shake up Washington,” said Scott Jennings, a Republican and senior CNN political commentator who appeared on CNN after the surprising pick of Gaetz. Other Trump choices, like Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state, are more conventional.
Jennings said no one should underestimate Trump’s ability to push some of these nominees through the Senate now that he’s claiming a mandate after winning the presidential election.
Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a Florida Democrat who served with Gaetz in both the Florida legislature and US House, said there should be no surprise that Trump would pick Gaetz, who has been one of Trump’s most effective advocates in Congress.

Gaetz is known for scorched-earth tactics in the House and was instrumental in ousting then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy last year for negotiating with Democrats. He might be controversial enough to challenge even Trump’s ability to get an attorney general confirmed.
“Matt Gaetz knows exactly what to do with the attorney general’s office,” Moskowitz said, noting that Gaetz is loyal to Trump and “competent.” He added that Gaetz will be “the most powerful attorney general in American history.”
Trump has previously expressed a desire to drastically change both the national security apparatus and the Department of Justice, which he still blames for the investigation into Russian election meddling in the 2016 election.

Trump wants power to get around Senate confirmations
Trump already demanded a fast track around the Senate confirmation process when he encouraged Republicans to back the concept of “recess appointments” for his picks.
It would be a major evolution for Republican senators to back such appointments, which can be made when the Senate is out of session. Ten years ago, Senate Republicans took the Obama administration to the US Supreme Court over this issue, winning a unanimous ruling and guaranteeing their constitutional ability to have input on who runs the US government.
Back then, Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican who is now a major Trump ally, called President Barack Obama’s attempt to use a recess appointment to make the National Labor Relations Board function an attempt to “circumvent Congress and ignore the Constitution in order to achieve its controversial political agenda.”
Now it’s a bit awkward that some Senate Republicans want to hand Trump the power to make recess appointments without their input after he demanded it over the weekend.
Recess appointments are temporary hirings that can last a year or two. The goal is speed since the clock is already ticking on Trump’s coming presidency.
“We know that President Trump will only have four years to reshape our federal government,” Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, told Fox Business.
Four years may be optimistic. Each of the last three presidents – Obama, Trump and Joe Biden – achieved their major legislative wins in the first two years of their presidency before losing control of the House as part of a now-normal backlash against presidents in power.
Some Republicans were surprised at Trump’s defense pick
Republicans are poised to have a 53-47 seat majority in the Senate if they win the race in Pennsylvania, where the Republican candidate David McCormick holds a slim lead. That should give them enough votes to push through any Trump appointment, although some Republican senators were scratching their heads at the Hegseth pick.
“Wow,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
“Who?” asked Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, according to NBC.
“Interesting,” said Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina.
Others were supportive. Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma praised Hegseth for not being politically correct.
“The requirement is that President Trump gets to nominate the individual and the Senate gets to confirm them. I trust President Trump’s decision,” Mullin told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Wednesday.
Mullin was less convinced by the Gaetz pick.
“He’s got to come to the Senate and sell himself,” Mullin said. “There’s a lot of questions out there.”
Grasping for power
If there’s a theme to this new Trump administration in the making, it’s that the president-elect wants to quickly go big, rewriting some of the rules in Washington, seizing more power for the president to get around Congress and to mold the federal bureaucracy.
Daniel Farber is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and author of a book on presidential power. He told me in an email that there has been a long-term trend of presidents trying to consolidate power in the executive branch.
“One thing that has kept this from going to extremes is that most presidents understand that they need competent, experienced staff across the government to carry out their programs effectively. I don’t think Trump has that view,” he said.
Reports of a special committee to reassess the loyalty of generals is outside the norm and could place Trump-approved generals at the Pentagon.
Then there’s the selection of Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk to lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency,” cross-branded with Musk’s favorite cryptocurrency, DOGE.

Many are wondering where these two businessmen will find $2 trillion to cut from the sprawling federal government. Trump promised they would figure out how to “dismantle the federal bureaucracy,” but they don’t currently have any official power or mandate from Congress. Musk said there would be a suggestion box online and they also could show how government money is wasted.

There are ways that Trump could give Musk and Ramaswamy official power or even officially hire them without forcing Musk to divest from Tesla and SpaceX – but it’s telling that Trump does not appear to be pursuing those options, according to Norm Eisen, a senior fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution who also served as “ethics czar” in the Obama administration.
“It’s the beginning of the end for them,” Eisen predicted of their relationship with Trump, pointing to the many recommendations of government commissions that have long since been forgotten without any action. “Trump doesn’t really want to share with strong personalities who might be rivals.”
Meanwhile, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the vaccine skeptic who endorsed Trump, wants broad latitude over US health policy but apparently may not be given a Cabinet role.
Now in power, Thune notes constitutional role
On recess appointments, there are some indications that top Senate Republicans won’t want to so easily give away their power to have input on appointments.
All of the candidates vying to be the Republican Senate majority leader when Republicans take the majority in January expressed some openness to the idea of recess appointments, including the ultimate winner, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota.
But when he spoke to reporters on Capitol Hill after winning the position Wednesday, Thune pointed out that the Senate “has an advise and consent role in the Constitution.”
While Thune did not reject the idea of recess appointments, he was clear that senators aren’t giving anything up quite yet.
“We want to make sure our committees have confirmation hearings like they typically do,” he said, although he warned Democrats against gumming up the process too much, or Senate Republicans will “explore all options.”
Thune also pledged that Republicans will respect the legislative filibuster, the custom by which a minority of senators can squash most legislation.
“The Senate, as you know, is by the founder’s design, a place where the minority has a voice in our process,” he said.
Anyone who can remember all the way back to 2017 – the first year of Trump’s first term, when Republicans held the House, Senate and White House like they will next year – will recall that Trump routinely groused about the filibuster back then as an impediment to getting legislation passed.
CNN projected Wednesday that Republicans will hold a majority in the House, but it is sure to be much smaller than the majority Republicans held the first time Trump governed. That means it will be more difficult to pass legislation with only Republicans.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/donald-trump-cabinet-what-matters/index.html
207,General Politics,2024,11,"Republicans will retain House majority, CNN projects, completing GOP’s dominance of Washington",Stephen Collinson,"CNN
 — 
Republicans have secured their monopoly on power in Donald Trump’s new Washington, retaining their majority in the House of Representatives, CNN projected Wednesday, ushering in a dramatic new era of right-wing populist rule.
The GOP’s control of both chambers of Congress – won after Republicans were projected to hold two House seats in California and Arizona – means that the president-elect will have a path to enact an agenda that could profoundly change America, including sweeping tax cuts, hardline immigration enforcement and a transformation of domestic and foreign policy.
Republican dominance of Capitol Hill is just one aspect of Trump’s formidable new power base. A president-elect who already believed that he had all-but-limitless power will be emboldened by last summer’s Supreme Court ruling offering substantial immunity to the commander in chief for official acts taken in office.
Trump may also have the chance in the next four years to replace older members of the court, potentially extending until the middle of the century the conservative majority he built in his first term.
And as Trump unveils his team of Cabinet members and top West Wing staff, made up largely of ultra loyalists, it’s already clear that the 47th president will face few of the restraints that experienced career officials tried to impose on some of his most outlandish schemes when he was the 45th president.
Trump’s team is promising an aggressive first 100-day agenda to enact as much of his “Make America Great Again” plan early next year after tapping into the public’s concern about high prices and undocumented migrants to help the GOP win the White House, the Senate and now the House.
Republicans flipped the Senate by defeating Democrats defending red states and, with one outstanding race yet to be projected, they control 52 seats. While the Senate filibuster means that 60 votes are needed to pass most major legislation, party leaders will be able to use the same budgetary devices that helped President Joe Biden pass some big-ticket items.
The GOP’s victory in the House represents a triumph for Speaker Mike Johnson, who struggled to control his restive conference over the last year. The House GOP often plunged into chaos and infighting — some of which was exacerbated by Trump’s interventions and the behavior of some of his most outspoken supporters. The narrow majority meant that any one member could decide to stage a revolt or to break with leadership for personal political gain.
The question now will be how large next year’s House majority becomes and whether the GOP can widen the margin of a handful of seats that has made managing the conference so complex for Johnson. The fact that Trump will be in the White House with the GOP in full control could make unity easier next year. However, Trump is already poaching from the incoming majority for his Cabinet picks, and even with those members hailing from safe Republican seats, their likely vacancies could last long enough to cause headaches for Johnson.
Democrats had held out fading hopes in the days after the election that they could flip the House and create a sole bastion against Trump’s rule — a feat that looked like a possibility for much of the year given the chamber’s unproductive record and Johnson’s struggle to assert control. Democrats were targeting Republicans sitting in districts that Biden had won four years ago – many of which were in New York and California – but with Trump’s resounding victory this year, some of those seats became harder to pick off.
Democrats are now left with the momentous task of regrouping ahead of the midterm elections in 2026 — without a single platform of power in Washington.
Republicans had seized back the House in the 2022 midterm elections to put a brake on Biden’s term, largely through winning a flurry of those competitive seats in New York and California. Democrats managed to flip several New York seats this year, but Trump’s relative strength for a Republican presidential candidate in the state of his birth helped limit Democratic gains. Democrats also failed to knock off some other key targets, like GOP Rep. Don Bacon, whose Omaha-area district in Nebraska gave Vice President Kamala Harris an electoral vote. And the GOP captured some of its top targets in Pennsylvania and Michigan.
That left the destiny of the House playing out in counts stretching well past Election Day in California, Oregon, Arizona, Iowa and Alaska, among other places.
Democrats held on to some of their most competitive seats, however, like that of vulnerable Washington state Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, and were hopeful about others in Ohio and Maine in strong Trump territory.
Johnson, who rose from obscurity on the backbenches to the speakership after a party meltdown following the ouster of previous House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in 2023, anchored his strategy to keep the chamber — and, if possible, enlarge his majority — on a tight alliance with Trump. The Louisiana Republican traveled to the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago resort to celebrate on election night and his office has been coordinating closely with the transition team.
And on Wednesday, before Trump’s arrival at a closed-door meeting with House Republicans, Johnson heralded the president-elect as “the comeback king,” according to a source in the room.
Trump backed his bid to remain speaker, and the Louisiana Republican was later nominated unanimously by voice vote, two sources in the room told CNN. He’ll face a House floor vote on January 3.
Despite some conservatives pressing Johnson – on everything from not sending more money to Ukraine to why the GOP didn’t win more seats – the party largely projected unity behind Trump and his backing of Johnson.
“If Donald Trump says jump three feet high and scratch your head, we all jump three feet high and scratch our heads,” GOP Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas told CNN. “That’s it.”
The speaker does face one looming crisis — a need to raise the government’s borrowing limit, perhaps by early summer, although there may be limited appetite from fiscal hawks in the party to provoke a showdown that could anger Trump.

 — 
On the heels of the general election last week, there’s another important vote on tap this Wednesday in Washington that will greatly impact what President-elect Donald Trump can accomplish during his four years in office: Republicans in the Senate will vote by secret ballot to choose a new leader.
Trump will also be in Washington, meeting in the morning with House Republicans and then traveling to the White House to meet with President Joe Biden.

Trump looms large as Congress faces shutdown threat and ‘dizzying’ to-do list
Come January, Republicans will control the Senate. While Trump has not endorsed a candidate in the Senate leadership race, he has called on senators to cede him some power and commit to allowing him to appoint Cabinet secretaries in recess appointments – a way for presidents to essentially bypass Congress that is a break from recent practice.
Trump’s most vocal supporters are organizing behind Florida Sen. Rick Scott, a controversial figure who is still viewed as the long-shot option. The more establishment options are Sen. John Thune of South Dakota and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas. The rare leadership battle is unique for senators, since it is playing out not just behind closed doors in the Capitol but also in public on conservative media.
Ultimately, the question for Republican lawmakers is whether they want to pick a leader who has years of experience in the arcane practices of the Senate or a leader who was early to tap into the MAGA movement.
End of the McConnell era
Sen. Mitch McConnell, 82, is the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history, having been the top Republican in the chamber since the tail end of the George W. Bush administration.
History may remember him most for engineering a conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, refusing to allow then-President Barack Obama’s nominee to get a vote with a delay in 2016 and then quickly ramming through a nominee, Trump’s third, one week before Trump lost the 2020 election.
McConnell will stay in the chamber until his term ends in 2026 but has cleared the way for a new generation of leaders to deal with Trump. McConnell has admitted that his brand of Republicanism seems out of place in Trump’s populist version of the party.

Trump and McConnell tangled frequently, especially after the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. McConnell did not ultimately vote to convict Trump during an impeachment trial, but he did say Trump was “disgraceful.” Trump went on to criticize McConnell and use racist language to describe McConnell’s wife, Elaine Chao, who served as Transportation secretary in Trump’s first Cabinet.
The duality of McConnell is that he has both criticized Trump – he told a recent biographer Trump was a “sleazeball” and that the MAGA movement is wrong – and also capitalized on Trump’s ascent, helped protect Trump as president in his first term and ultimately backed his run for the White House this year. “We are all on the same team now,” he said.
McConnell will also be remembered for how the Senate changed during his leadership, when use of the filibuster exploded and was employed to blockade the opposing party. Multiple Democrats endorsed nuking the filibuster during Biden’s administration, given their slim Senate majority. Come January, they will rely on it to block Trump’s agenda.
After Trump’s victory last week, McConnell said he was confident that the filibuster would be in safe hands with a Republican majority.
A big decision for Republican senators
Senate Republicans could move in wildly different directions, depending on who replaces McConnell.
Thune is McConnell’s No. 2, the Republican whip, and Cornyn previously held that role. Both were first elected to the Senate during the Bush administration and have spent decades as senators. Both have at times been critical of Trump, who once called on Republicans in South Dakota to launch a primary challenge against Thune.

Conservative firebrands set to chair key Senate committees in new Congress
Having lived through periods in the majority and the minority, both Thune and Cornyn might be unwilling to drastically change the status quo in the Senate.
Scott, on the other hand, wants drastic change.
“We have got to change the way the Senate is run to get Trump’s agenda done,” he said on Fox News.
While it’s ultimately Republican senators voting in secret who will choose their leader, Scott has tried to mobilize Trump’s followers to make the leadership race part of the Trump movement.
“Right now, it’s really just the Washington establishment versus the Republicans that want to elect Trump,” Scott told the right-wing provocateur Laura Loomer on her podcast.
Thune seemed to reject the establishment vs. insurgent view in an opinion piece for Fox News, arguing that Republicans would have to set aside differences to deliver on Trump’s agenda in the face of what will surely be unified opposition from Democrats.
“If we don’t successfully execute on our mandate, we risk losing the coalition that swept Republicans into office up and down the ballot,” Thune wrote.
Cornyn is taking a very different approach.
“I’m not going to do this in the press,” he told CNN’s Lauren Fox.
But the candidates have been laying groundwork for months. CNN’s Capitol Hill team noted last week that Thune and Cornyn worked hard during the campaign season to help GOP colleagues. Cornyn appeared next to Trump during Trump’s trips to Texas, and Thune met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in Florida.

CNN
 — 
President Joe Biden’s exit from the world stage this week was less of a dramatic mic drop and more of a slow fade from view, a low-key conclusion to a lengthy foreign policy career whose legacy is now under threat by Donald Trump.
Not quite a valedictory tour, Biden’s swing through South America was overshadowed by the incoming administration, with fellow leaders turning their attention and concern to Mar-a-Lago and the string of controversial picks Trump has made for his Cabinet.
In back-hallway conversations at summits in Peru and Brazil, delegations whispered among themselves about the incoming American team, looking for clues of what the next four years will hold. Biden was able to offer his counterparts few assurances; it wasn’t clear many were even looking for them.

Instead, the president and his team tried to use the trip to highlight accomplishments that many leaders and US officials now fear could be reversed or simply forgotten amid the change in administrations.
Even as he worked to burnish his legacy, however, Biden elected not to speak at length about his record or the new world his counterparts are about to enter. A statement delivered from the Amazon rainforest about his climate accomplishments ran only seven minutes; it was the longest address of his trip.
As he concluded his final speech to the G20 leaders Tuesday, warning them that “history is watching” as they make decisions on climate change, Biden cut himself off — choosing to leave unsaid the obvious reality that US climate policy would change drastically come January.
“And I’m not going to say anymore. I have much more to say, but I’m not going to,” he told the heads of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations. “But thank you for focusing on this issue. I really think is the existential issue humanity faces.”
Biden takes his diminished role in stride
Joined by his daughter and granddaughter, Biden seemed to take his diminished position in stride, evincing little wistfulness as he bid farewell to fellow leaders with whom he’s spent the last four years working alongside.
Some, like China’s Xi Jinping, he’s known much longer. Behind closed doors, the two men put down their notes at the end of a two-hour meeting Saturday to reflect on their lengthy relationship and their willingness to get blunt about where they disagreed.
But even Xi appeared ready to move on to Trump as their talks got underway, issuing a loosely veiled warning to the incoming president and his team of national security hawks.
“Make the wise choice,” he said, sitting across from Biden in a vast conference room at the hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying. “Keep exploring the right way for two major countries to get along well with each other.”
A botched photo op Monday that left Biden and a handful of other leaders out of a group picture only furthered the impression of a world moving on.
As leaders including Xi, India’s Narendra Modi and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan all grasped hands and smiled for cameras, Biden was still inside talking with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Photographers urged organizers to delay the picture, calling out that Biden and others were missing. But the leaders dispersed, leaving Biden to confer with two of his aides afterward.

The moment was a fluke, the type of logistical error that’s almost inevitable at gatherings of almost two dozen world leaders. Yet it was difficult to ignore the impression it left: that Biden is disappearing from view as the world turns its attention to his successor.
Trump takes the spotlight
Already, Trump has received invitations from leaders eager to host him on a presidential visit once he takes office. In a congratulatory call, Erdogan invited the president-elect to visit his country in person, a bid to try to reset ties between the countries after tensions flared over trade and human rights during Trump’s first term.
In a video of the call posted on X, Indonesia’s president offered to fly anywhere to congratulate Trump in person. “I’d like to also get to your country some time,” Trump told him.
And Argentina’s president, Javier Milei — who held up work on a joint communique at the G20 this week over language around taxing the ultra-wealthy — became the first world leader to greet Trump in person following his election victory, attending a black-tie dinner at the president-elect’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and joining members with a dance to Trump rally anthem “YMCA.”
ANALYSIS
Trump doubles down on provocative Cabinet picks as their fates hang in the balance
Biden’s aides this week have tried to avoid getting sucked into questions about the incoming administration’s intentions. They have refused to comment on even the most controversial selections Trump has made for his Cabinet, despite concerns from some world leaders at some of the names — including former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who Trump chose to oversee intelligence agencies, and Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick to head the Pentagon.
What members of Biden’s team have been willing to acknowledge is how little they actually know about what Trump and his team may be planning.
“The incoming administration is not in the business of providing us assurances about anything,” Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said in Peru. “They’ll make their own decisions as they go forward.”
A senior administration official speaking after Biden’s speech in the rainforest was blunter when asked whether Trump would continue sending American funding to help preserve the Amazon.
“Who knows?” the official said. “Maybe he’ll come down here and see the forest and see the damage being done from drought and other things and change his mind about climate change.”
Biden tries to keep the focus on his legacy
Biden himself has used his brief public appearances to pressure leaders into maintaining the projects he worked on, even after he exits the world stage.
During a visit to the Amazon rainforest — which the White House was quick to point out was a first for a sitting American president — he warned his successor against scrapping climate initiatives passed over the last four years.

“It’s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America. But nobody, nobody can reverse it. Nobody,” Biden said, wearing a blue outdoor shirt in the sweltering Amazon heat.
But as he turned around and walked down a dirt path lined with lush foliage, Biden declined to answer any questions — about his climate initiatives or anything else.
In fact, Biden’s final set of summits represents the first major gathering of leaders where he’s declined to take questions from the press in a formal setting — a departure from his predecessors and his own tradition while in office.
In the Amazon rainforest, Biden delivered a short speech to a small pool of reporters before exiting the lectern silently. In Lima and Rio de Janiero, Biden fielded no questions from the press and his aides spoke only off-camera.
It’s a departure from Biden’s own tradition: Over the last four years, Biden and his team have preferred to hold news conferences while on foreign soil or while flanked at the White House by an allied leader. The latter format traditionally allows at least four questions from domestic and overseas press.
No news conference
Biden held news conferences at all four gatherings of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations during his term and in conjunction with every annual summit of NATO leaders; in 2023, the event was held with the president of Finland, NATO’s newest member.
Reporters had opportunities to ask Biden questions at the G20 summit in Rome in 2021, in Bali in 2022, and in Vietnam in 2023, following the summit’s conclusion in India the prior day. At the time, Sullivan blamed India’s Modi for withholding press access on-site at the G20 itself.
During a state visit to France in June, Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron delivered joint statements from the Elysée in Paris. At the time, officials had suggested that fielding questions from reporters — one week before Biden was scheduled to do so at the G7 summit — would be “duplicative,” according to a person briefed on the discussions.
Four months later, Biden pursued the same format with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on a visit to Berlin.
By contrast, then-President Barack Obama, following the election of Trump in 2016, took two opportunities while overseas to defend his record, acknowledge the change sought by the electorate and stake out what he saw as the US’ position in the world.
Speaking from the Lima Convention Center, the very same venue where Biden attended the APEC summit last week, Obama argued for enduring American leadership even in the the era of Trump.
“The American president and the United States of America — if we’re not on the side of what’s right, if we’re not making the argument and fighting for it, even if sometimes we’re not able to deliver at 100% everywhere — then it collapses,” Obama argued. “And there’s nobody to fill the void.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/joe-biden-g20-fades/index.html

 — 
China rejected a meeting with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a conference in southeast Asia this week, marking the latest turn in a tumultuous relationship between the two countries’ defense leaders.
Austin sought to meet with his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, at the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting-Plus in Laos as part of a long-standing effort to maintain military lines of communication between the US and the People’s Republic of China. But China did not accept the offer, pointing to a recent Taiwan arms sale as their rationale, a senior defense official told reporters traveling with Austin in Laos.
Three weeks ago, the US approved a $2 billion arms sale to Taiwan, including a first-time provision of advanced surface-to-air missiles to the self-governed island. China immediately criticized the sale, promising to take “resolute countermeasures” to defend its sovereignty.
The Chinese rejection of the meeting in Laos comes just days after US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in Peru for their final meeting under Biden’s administration. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the meeting was “candid, constructive, [and] wide ranging,” but that Biden would not act as a conduit between the Chinese government and the incoming Trump administration.
China has often used the cancellation of meetings and lines of communication as a way of registering displeasure with the United States. After then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in 2022, China cut off a number of lines of communication with the US, including on military issues and climate.
The rejection comes after a seeming improvement in military-to-military communications between the two countries over the last year or so.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/china-rebuffs-meeting-with-us-defense-secretary/index.html
211,General Politics,2024,11,Republican introduces anti-transgender bathroom resolution at Capitol after first transgender woman elected to Congress,Morgan Rimmer,"CNN
 — 
A House Republican is pushing to ban transgender women from women’s restrooms at the US Capitol, two weeks after history was made with the election of America’s first out transgender person to Congress.
South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace on Monday introduced a resolution to amend the rules of the US House of Representatives less than two months before Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, a Delaware state senator, is sworn-in in January.
“Sarah McBride doesn’t get a say. I mean, this is a biological man,” the South Carolina Republican told reporters on Monday, adding that the lawmaker “does not belong in women’s spaces, women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, changing rooms, period, full stop.”
Later Monday, McBride wrote in an apparent response on X that “every day Americans go to work with people who have life journeys different than their own and engage with them respectfully, I hope members of Congress can muster that same kindness.”
The congresswoman-elect continued in another post: “This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact that they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.”
“We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars,” she continued. “Delawareans sent me here to make the American dream more affordable and accessible and that’s what I’m focused on.”
Mace, pressed by reporters earlier in the evening on whether she was going after a marginalized person, told CNN, “This is a biological man trying to force himself into women’s spaces, and I’m not going to tolerate it.”
She continued, “I’m the first woman to graduate from the Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina. If some guy in a skirt came by and said, ‘No, that’s my achievement.’ I’m going to be there and standing in the way and saying, ‘Hell no.’ I’m not going to allow men to erase women or women’s rights.”
On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he is working to “provide accommodations for every member of Congress.” He refused to acknowledge specifics of the GOP’s plans and said, “This is an issue Congress has never addressed before.”
In the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022 and her party’s efforts to hold onto women voters, Mace – the first woman to graduate from the Citadel’s Corps of Cadets — has often said she’s looking for ways to show that the GOP is “pro-women.”
McBride, during her run in the reliably blue state to fill the seat vacated by Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester — who went on a successful Senate run — didn’t lean on the historic nature of her campaign. She emphasized her work leading a bipartisan push to pass paid family and medical leave in the state and touted support from unions and her work to raise the state minimum wage. But on the trail, she did allude to a broader theme of respect — specifically, that everyone deserves a member of Congress that respects them and their families.

Similar bans targeting trans people using bathrooms associated with their gender identities, particularly in schools, have sparked controversy in recent years – with supporters arguing that the measures protect students while critics say that they are dehumanizing and unnecessary.
In 2023, Republican-led legislatures in several states passed bills to ban transgender students from using locker rooms and bathrooms associated with their gender identities in what the Human Rights Campaign – the largest LGBTQ advocacy group in the US – called the biggest year for “bathroom bills.” The Ohio Senate last week greenlit its own measure, which now awaits a signature from the state’s Republican governor.

212,General Politics,2024,11,DNC chair race kicks off as Ken Martin and Martin O’Malley launch bids,Arit John,"CNN
 — 
Just two weeks after a bruising presidential election, the race to lead the Democratic Party has begun in earnest, with Minnesota Democratic party chair Ken Martin and former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley entering the race this week.
Martin and O’Malley have kicked off a roughly three-month sprint to the Democratic National Committee’s election of its next leader. The decision – which will be made by the roughly 450 members of the DNC early next year – comes as Democrats seek to regroup and rebrand after a devastating election cycle for their party, with Republicans reclaiming the presidency and the US Senate and holding on to the US House.
Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor and commissioner of the Social Security Administration, on Monday became the first person to announce a bid to lead the Democratic National Committee as the party plots a post-election path forward.
“We must organize in every state and speak to the economic concerns of every person in America,” O’Malley said in a statement provided to CNN. “Jobs, opportunity, economic security for all. These are the goals of our Party and these are the things that make our country stronger.”
With no Democrat leading from the White House, the next chair will become the face, and voice, of the party. The future chair will also oversee the debate around the party’s 2028 presidential primary calendar.
Democrats’ rules panel will hold a meeting next month to discuss the process for electing the next chair, who will replace outgoing leader Jaime Harrison. Democrats have not selected a date, but the new chair must be elected by March 1.
Martin and O’Malley are the first declared candidates in what is expected to be a crowded field. Democrats haven’t had an open election for chair since 2017, when former Labor Secretary Tom Perez beat then-Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison in what was viewed as a proxy war between the establishment and progressive wings of the party.
This time around, several DNC members said they want to see someone from outside of Washington, DC, who will invest in building out the party’s infrastructure and organizing power.
“We definitely need to be looking outside of the beltway,” said New Hampshire Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley. “And it has to be somebody that really understands the strength of grassroots – and we need to get back to that. Spending hundreds of millions of dollars on television every election doesn’t seem to be getting us much.”
Martin could be joined in the race by another state party chair: Ben Wikler, the chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party.
“It’s something he’s seriously considering, but no final decision has been made,” a source familiar with Wikler’s thinking told CNN.
Other potential candidates who have been making calls include former New Orleans Mayor and Biden administration official Mitch Landrieu, US Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel and outgoing California Sen. Laphonza Butler, according to a Democratic source with knowledge of the calls.
Martin enters the race with 83 endorsements from DNC members, according to his campaign, and deep relationships with committee members. He has led his state party since 2011, been a DNC vice chair since 2017 and leads the Association of State Democratic Committees, which lobbies for state parties.
“If you’re looking for a creature of DC, that’s not me,” Martin said in his announcement video. “But I do know how the DNC works – and how it isn’t working.”
Martin sketched out a path for Democrats in a Fox News op-ed Monday in which he argued one issue facing the party is that voters don’t associate Democratic policies – such as raising the minimum wage – with their candidates.
“In 2017, we found ourselves in an era of resistance,” he wrote. “In 2025, we need to counter the excesses and extremes of the new Trump administration while also defining a clear agenda which centers on the struggles of everyday Americans hoping to get ahead, not just get by.”
O’Malley, the commissioner of the Social Security Administration and a former 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, has also emphasized the economy in his pitch on how Democrats should proceed.
“We must organize in every state and speak to the economic concerns of every person in America,” O’Malley said in a statement provided to CNN. “Jobs, opportunity, economic security for all. These are the goals of our Party and these are the things that make our country stronger.”
O’Malley has had roughly 50 conversations with Democratic officials across the country in recent days as he has mulled a run, according to people familiar with the discussions. He has endorsements from three DNC members and has had encouraging conversations with Democrats including Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.
“The feedback we’ve received is strong and encouraging,” O’Malley said.
As Democrats seek a new strategy, O’Malley has pitched the broad outlines of a plan to reimagine what the DNC looks like, such as empowering state parties. He would lean on his experience running the Democratic Governors Association, where he helped capture state-wide races in purple and red states like Kentucky, West Virginia and Montana. Of the three, Kentucky is the only state that still has a Democratic governor.
“There is a better day ahead,” O’Malley said. “But we must rebuild our Party so we can all get there together.”
The Maryland Democrat announced Monday his resignation from the Social Security Administration, which will take effect at the end of the month.
Among the many challenges facing the next DNC chair will be reshaping the 2028 Democratic presidential primary calendar. Last year, Democrats revamped their presidential primary calendar to put South Carolina first, followed by Nevada and New Hampshire, in conflict with the last state’s first-in-the-nation primary law.
The reshuffling, at the behest of President Joe Biden, was designed to elevate more diverse states but also played to Biden’s strengths. During his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden lost handily in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary but made a comeback after winning the South Carolina primary.
This time, there will be no incumbent president to set the calendar, leaving states to jockey for themselves.
“As far as specific candidates for chair, don’t know who that will be, but the one thing I do know is that we are the litmus test for America,” said Nevada Democratic party chair Daniele Monroe-Moreno. “All roads to the White House lead through this state, and we know how to win here.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/politics/dnc-chair-race-martin-o-malley/index.html
213,General Politics,2024,11,Trump picks former congressman and Fox Business host Sean Duffy as next Transportation secretary,Kate Sullivan,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday he has selected former congressman and recent Fox Business co-host Sean Duffy to serve as the next secretary of the Department of Transportation.
Duffy served in the US House of Representatives from 2011 to 2019, representing Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District. He most recently was co-host of Fox Business’ “The Bottom Line,” after first joining Fox News as a contributor in 2020.
Duffy’s last day as a Fox News employee was Monday, a network spokesperson confirmed to CNN. Wednesday marked his last day appearing on Fox Business, and he interviewed for the role of transportation secretary later in the week, according to a source.
Trump in a statement praised Duffy as a “tremendous and well-liked public servant” and said he was “a respected voice and communicator in the Republican Conference” during his time in Congress.
“He will prioritize Excellence, Competence, Competitiveness and Beauty when rebuilding America’s highways, tunnels, bridges and airports. He will ensure our ports and dams serve our Economy without compromising our National Security, and he will make our skies safe again by eliminating DEI for pilots and air traffic controllers,” Trump said.
Duffy, who served as chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations and on the House Committee on Financial Services during his time in Congress, has little to no experience in the transportation field.
If confirmed by the Senate, he would oversee projects that involve companies run by Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who has been tapped by the president-elect to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency. Musk’s companies have billions of dollars in contracts with the federal government across a number of agencies, including the Department of Transportation.

The new leader of the department will face a number of safety-related issues regarding aviation, including plane manufacturer Boeing’s string of quality control and manufacturing issues. There are also airline labor union strike threats and climate-focused initiatives like electric vehicles and charging stations that are likely to be on his desk in the coming years.
Established in 1966, the Department of Transportation has nearly 55,000 workers and leads the country’s safety, sustainability and efficiency efforts with regard to all forms of travel and transport.
In the role, Duffy would takeover the department from Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was named to lead the department in February 2021. During Trump’s first administration, Elaine Chao headed the agency before resigning after the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
Duffy initially found fame appearing on MTV’s “The Real World: Boston” in 1997. The following year, he competed in the network’s reality competition “Road Rules: All Stars” where he met the woman he would marry, “The Real World: San Francisco” cast member Rachel Campos. Campos-Duffy is the co-host of “Fox & Friends Weekend,” where she worked for years alongside Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick for defense secretary.
Before running for Congress, Duffy served as district attorney of Ashland County, Wisconsin, from 2002 to 2008. He is also formerly a professional lumberjack athlete and ESPN color commentator.
As a congressman, Duffy introduced a bill that would have expanded Trump’s presidential powers to impose tariffs — something Trump has vowed to do in his next term. The bill was disregarded by his fellow Republicans at the time but earned him praise from Trump.
Duffy resigned his congressional seat in 2019, saying in a statement at the time that he wanted to spend more time with his family ahead of the birth of his ninth child and that there had been complications with his wife’s pregnancy.
Prior to joining Fox News, Duffy was a CNN political commentator. He also joined lobbying firm BGR Group – which has represented clients in defense services, automotive and air transport industries – in 2019 as senior counsel, according to Open Secrets. Duffy’s represented industries were securities, transportation, finance, accountants and electronics manufacturing, according to Open Secrets. BGR Public Relations President Jeff Birnbaum told CNN that Duffy was on the company’s advisory board and not an employee, and that Duffy provided “strategic advisory work only” and not lobbying.
Duffy resigned from the advisory board effective at the time of the announcement of his pick to be the Transportation secretary nominee, BGR said.

214,General Politics,2024,11,‘It’s on him’: Democrats look to Hakeem Jeffries to plot a path to revival,Sarah Ferris,"CNN
 — 
Hakeem Jeffries nearly became House speaker. Instead, he’s steering the Democratic Party through an identity crisis and hoping to avoid an ugly intraparty civil war.
Even without the gavel, many Democrats across Washington say House Minority Leader Jeffries — a 54-year-old New Yorker with centrist roots and messaging chops — is about to become the de facto voice of the party’s future and the face of resistance to Donald Trump. As expected, he was reelected to lead the House Democratic caucus on Tuesday, and he did not face a challenge.
So far, Jeffries has said little about his role in the party’s postelection rebuild. But his allies say he’s aware of the part he’s about to play. And many are making the case directly to him: Multiple Democratic donors have personally urged him to “take the lead” until the party has a new official leader, according to two people familiar with the discussions.
“‘You are the guy for the entire country right now,’” Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a longtime ally, recalled recently telling Jeffries. “I don’t think he’s ever tried to reach that kind of position, but it’s on him.”
Jeffries is already playing referee in some of the biggest internal spats emerging from the election. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, for instance, is privately sparring over how the party should handle Trump’s promised mass deportations. Progressives are seething over corporate influence in internal meetings. One group of centrists has even privately discussed a contentious term limits proposal aimed at the party’s old-guard committee leaders, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
One of Jeffries’ most urgent questions will be how to handle another two years in the minority — this time, in a GOP-run Washington. He and his leadership team are already discussing how to avoid a repeat of 2016, when Democrats “chased Donald Trump every hour” while failing to deliver their own message, according to one leadership aide. There are even some preliminary talks about sending Jeffries and leadership to battleground turf around the county to help diagnose their party’s failings outside of Capitol Hill.
Back in Washington, even though Democrats will be in the minority, they have a significant role to play in a House with a narrow Republican majority where GOP infighting over the last two years led to one of the least productive sessions ever. In the last Congress, Democrats repeatedly helped Republicans keep the government open and propped up Speaker Mike Johnson when he faced a challenge to his leadership post. In a new era under a Trump administration with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress, Democrats are weighing whether they want to continue to extend a lifeline, with many expressing their ideas to Jeffries directly.
“We have to take a long hard look at what our leverage is” Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the influential House Appropriations Committee, told CNN.
Even before the election, Jeffries had been aggressively working behind the scenes to try to convince the Biden-Harris administration to sharpen its economic strategy. In meetings with White House advisers, Jeffries frequently paraphrased a famed Hollywood quote that every good story needs a good villain, according to two people who’ve heard him say it, as he urged Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to make an enemy out of corporations over price gouging. For more than a year, he was on a “crusade” with the Biden-Harris team, urging them to craft a more hard-hitting, succinct economic message, that person said. He even tapped other senior House Democrats to echo his message to the Biden team, according to another person familiar with the efforts.
Still, unlike some in his party, Jeffries is not in despair, according to multiple people familiar with his thinking. He believes he has a road map to flip the House in 2026 that looks a lot like the way he helped his party win back most of its New York seats this year. Democrats there dramatically overperformed Harris. And with his skill in recruiting candidates, some Democratic operatives are already talking about ways for Jeffries to be more involved in primaries — not just general elections — to ensure their party has the best chance at flipping the shrinking number of competitive seats nationwide.
Some are more pessimistic: Several Democrats told CNN the party won’t be fixed in Washington and that the fact that the party lost battleground seats in New York in the 2022 midterms was a clear warning sign. But Democrats say Jeffries — alongside Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will serve as minority leader in the next Congress — might be the best person to at least try.
“He is the next generation,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, a fellow New York Democrat. “He can talk hip-hop and he can talk civil rights.”
Working with Republicans
Flanked by newly elected members of Congress, Progressive Caucus Chair Pramila Jayapal had a bold prediction for how Democrats will operate in the next Congress: “Democrats will be united for a block and tackle and let [Republicans] figure out how they’re going to run.”
Not all Democrats feel that way.
House Rules Committee Chair Jim McGovern, whose panel plays a key role in determining what legislation gets brought to the House floor, is listening to Johnny Cash’s rendition of “I Won’t Back Down” as he prepares for the next Congress. But McGovern believes his party should look for opportunities to work with Republicans when the situation presents itself: “If there are areas we can work together, absolutely.”
For his part, Jeffries has telegraphed that he is open to working with Republicans, but — this time — does not want to get caught responding to Trump’s every move. Multiple members have approached Jeffries to weigh in on how the caucus should approach the strategy.

Pledging to work with Republicans when possible, Jeffries said, “The House Democratic Caucus will be a check and balance on this incoming administration. That’s not a partisan strategy. That’s James Madison’s strategy. So we’re going to do it.”
But when asked to respond to Trump’s string of controversial Cabinet picks, Jeffries didn’t hesitate to draw a line.
“No, that I’m not doing, because that’s all a distraction,” he said.
Internal party sparring
One of Jeffries’ toughest tasks will be keeping Democrats unified on immigration despite the many intraparty divisions.
Those cracks are already beginning to show. At a meeting of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus last week, Democrats heard from a panel of immigration experts about Trump’s mass deportation plans.
But things quickly got tense. At one point, one of the experts mentioned undocumented immigrants sitting in jail cells, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, a famously outspoken member on border issues, spoke up.
“I hope all of us are for deporting undocumented criminals,” Cuellar said as he looked around at fellow Democrats and an awkward silence fell over the room, according to three people who attended the meeting.
And that’s not the only time Democrats like Cuellar have spoken up to party leaders since the election.
Jeffries sat quietly alongside his two deputies as multiple fellow Democrats — including Reps. Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico, Susie Lee of Nevada and Scott Peters of California — spoke up about the role that border issues played in the party’s tough losses this month, according to two people in the room.

In the Democrats’ first postmortem “listening sessions,” these lawmakers said the party failed to address issues such as border security and crime. While Democrats did attempt a border deal with Republicans earlier this Congress, they said it happened far too late.
The border was not the only issue Democrats feel they were late to develop an inclusive response to, leading many to say that in this soul-searching period, the party needs to develop a better strategy of responding early and often.
“Democrats have to figure out how to communicate, where to communicate and on what mediums,” one lawmaker told CNN.

Attorney General Merrick Garland, nearing the end of his tenure leading the Justice Department, told career prosecutors Monday that they are the “backbone” of the Justice Department and urged them to continue to “uphold the rule of law.”
In his first public comments since President-elect Donald Trump selected former Rep. Matt Gaetz as his pick to run the Justice Department, Garland told prosecutors at the Southern District of New York to continue to protect the department’s “mission.”
Gaetz has derided the Justice Department as rife with members of the so-called “deep state” hostile to Trump.
“You can’t just have the same career people who have grown up in a system that has fallen victim to political capture,” Gaetz said in an interview this summer.
On Monday, Garland sought to rally department employees as he wraps up a tenure that has been overshadowed at times by investigations involving Trump but also has featured corruption cases against prominent Democrats such as Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey.
“I may be coming to the end of my tenure at the Justice Department, but I know that all of you will continue in the department’s mission – what has always been its mission – to uphold the rule of law, keep our country safe and to protect civil rights,” Garland said.

He continued: “The career lawyers of the Justice Department as a whole, you are the institutional backbone of this department. You are the historical memory of this department. You are the heart and soul of the department. You are the Justice Department.”
Garland has not publicly addressed Trump’s selection of Gaetz, but his comments come after Gaetz’s nomination shocked the department and concerned some Justice Department officials that his appointment will cause more people to leave either voluntarily or as part of efforts to push out employees who aren’t seen as loyal to the incoming administration.
“I could not be more proud of you, and I could not be more grateful for all of the work that you have done to protect the American people,” Garland said Monday.
Garland’s comments stand in contrast to the way his predecessor and likely successor have described the career ranks. Attorney General William Barr derided the traditional deference that top leaders have afforded to the department’s career employees, whose work often spans administrations of both major political parties.
“Letting the most junior members set the agenda might be a good philosophy for a Montessori preschool, but it’s no way to run a federal agency,” Barr said in a 2020 speech.
At the time, Barr was reacting to pushback from career attorneys and even some political appointees who criticized his intervention in politically sensitive cases that were important to Trump. Barr overruled career lawyers in the sentencing of Trump ally Roger Stone and ordered a review of the prosecution of Gen. Mike Flynn, leading to the department to drop the criminal charges.
Garland is making his final set of visits to US attorneys’ offices around the country, still short a handful of districts that he won’t be able to reach before his departure. Attorneys general traditionally make an effort to visit all US attorneys while they serve, a sprawling goal made more difficult now that the 94th US attorney’s office is a district that covers Guam and the North Mariana Islands.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/merrick-garland-comments-matt-gaetz/index.html
216,General Politics,2024,11,"Ahead of FEMA chief’s testimony to Congress, fired worker tells CNN she was following protocol when skipping Trump homes",,"CNN
 — 
The former Federal Emergency Management Agency employee who was fired earlier this month after being accused of skipping homes of Donald Trump supporters while providing relief in Florida after Hurricane Milton told CNN on Monday night that she was simply following FEMA protocol.
“What I’d like for the American people to know is before I even deployed to Florida, that this was the work culture there,” Marn’i Washington told CNN’s Laura Coates. “I was on two teams in Florida and the first team, when I arrived, they were implementing avoidance and de-escalation and unfortunately that trend ran with those Trump signs.”
FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell is set to testify on Capitol Hill on Tuesday afternoon before the House Oversight Committee in what will likely be fiery hearings as lawmakers question her about disaster relief and whether the agency avoided providing aid to Republicans in hard-hit areas.
CNN reported on threats against FEMA workers in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene the month before, including the case of a North Carolina man who was arrested for allegedly threatening harm against FEMA employees in October. Local authorities said the man was armed with a handgun and a rifle when he was arrested.
FEMA temporarily paused aid to several communities in North Carolina, and outreach resumed after about a day, a FEMA spokesperson said at the time.
Washington said her team encountered hostility from some residents in Florida as they went door-to-door.
“Yes, we’ve had people verbally express to us that our presence was unwelcome and unwanted. Some people had some tact about it and some people were not so nice about it,” she said.

Washington said FEMA’s guidelines to relief workers in Florida were to remove themselves from hostile situations if they felt threatened or unsafe.
“I did not act on my own volition. Everything we did was out of the focus of safety and making sure our team felt comfortable,” Washington told Coates. “I don’t create policy. FEMA does. I just implement it in the field.”
Asked if her relief team avoided all homes with Trump signs, Washington said, “It was only selected areas where there were teammates that felt uncomfortable, they did not feel safe and they feared for their safety.”
“We registered Trump supporters, we’ve given them service as well, just we avoided the areas that were hostile,” she added.
After Washington was fired, Criswell released a statement saying, “This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values & principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation. This was reprehensible.”
“It would be nice if Ms. Criswell would be human and come to terms with the fact that FEMA has not addressed the safety concerns that the crew leads and the specialists experience out in the Field,” Washington said. “There are plenty of reports that discuss hostile encounters, is how FEMA describes it, and our method is avoidance. I don’t understand why we’re hiding that from the American people.”
Washington said she has not been asked to appear before lawmakers herself, but that she would be willing to do so.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/politics/fema-hearing-intv-marni-washington-deanne-criswell/index.html
217,General Politics,2024,11,"Judge strikes down Wyoming abortion laws, including an explicit ban on pills to end pregnancy",,"Cheyenne, Wyoming
AP
 — 
A state judge on Monday struck down Wyoming’s overall ban on abortion and its first-in-the-nation explicit prohibition on the use of medication to end pregnancy.
Since 2022, Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens has ruled three times to block the laws while they were disputed in court.
The ruling marks another victory for abortion rights advocates after voters in seven states passed measures this month in support of access.
One Wyoming law that Owens said violated women’s rights under the state constitution bans abortion except to protect to a pregnant woman’s life or in cases involving rape and incest. The other made Wyoming the only state to explicitly ban abortion pills, though other states have instituted de facto bans on the medication by broadly prohibiting abortion.
The laws were challenged by four women, including two obstetricians, and two nonprofit organizations. One of the groups, Wellspring Health Access, opened in April 2023 as the state’s first full-service abortion clinic in years following an arson attack in 2022.
“This is a wonderful day for the citizens of Wyoming — and women everywhere who should have control over their own bodies,” Wellspring Health Access President Julie Burkhart said in a statement.

7 states vote to protect abortion rights, while efforts to expand access in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota fail
November’s elections saw voters in Missouri clear the way to undo one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion bans in a series of victories for abortion rights advocates. Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, meanwhile, defeated similar constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.
Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they’ll need to pass it again it 2026 for it to take effect. Another measure that bans discrimination on the basis of “pregnancy outcomes” prevailed in New York.
The abortion landscape underwent a seismic shift in 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, a ruling that ended a nationwide right to abortion and cleared the way for bans to take effect in most Republican-controlled states.
Thirteen states have bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in around six weeks into pregnancy — often before women realize they’re pregnant.
Nearly every ban has been challenged with a lawsuit. Courts have blocked enforcement of some restrictions, including bans throughout pregnancy in Utah and Wyoming. Judges struck down bans in Georgia and North Dakota in September. Georgia’s Supreme Court ruled the next month that the state’s ban can be enforced while it considers the case.
In the Wyoming case, the women and nonprofits who challenged the laws argued that the bans stood to harm their health, well-being and livelihoods, claims disputed by attorneys for the state. They also argued the bans violated a 2012 state constitutional amendment saying competent Wyoming residents have a right to make their own health care decisions.

See where abortions are banned and legal — and where it’s still in limbo
As she had done with previous rulings, Owens found merit in both arguments. The abortion bans “will undermine the integrity of the medical profession by hamstringing the ability of physicians to provide evidence-based medicine to their patients,” Owens ruled.
The abortion laws impede the fundamental right of women to make health care decisions for an entire class of people — those who are pregnant — in violation of the 2012 constitutional amendment, Owens ruled.
Wyoming voters approved that amendment amid fears of government overreach following approval of the federal Affordable Care Act and its initial requirements for people to have health insurance.
Attorneys for the state argued that health care, under the amendment, didn’t include abortion. Republican Gov. Mark Gordon, who signed the abortion laws into effect in 2022 and 2023, did not immediately return an email Monday seeking comment.
Both sides wanted Owens to rule on the lawsuit challenging the abortion bans rather than allow it to go to trial in the spring. A three-day bench trial before Owens was previously set but won’t be necessary with this ruling.

218,General Politics,2024,11,"Women testified to House panel that they were paid for sexual favors by Gaetz, lawyer says",Tierney Sneed,"CNN
 — 
Two women testified to the House Ethics Committee that they were paid for “sexual favors” by former Rep. Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, a lawyer for the two women told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday.
Additionally, one of the women testified to the congressional panel that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with her then-underage friend in 2017, the lawyer, Joel Leppard, said on “OutFront.” CNN reported that detail Friday.
Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Leppard said it was his client’s testimony that she did not believe Gaetz knew at the time that her friend was underage.

Florida court fight gives insight into the House review of sex allegations against Matt Gaetz
The ethics probe was effectively ended when Gaetz immediately resigned from Congress after Trump announced the Florida Republican was the president-elect’s pick to lead the Department of Justice. However, the panel is still weighing whether to publicly release a report on its probe and is scheduled to meet Wednesday.
The committee also heard from the formerly underage woman herself, who testified that Gaetz had sex with her when she was 17, according to two sources familiar with the congressional investigation.
One of Leppard’s clients was a friend to the then-minor from when they were both in high school, the lawyer said Monday.
“She was invited to a party in July of 2017,” Leppard told Burnett of his client. “She testified to the House that as she was walking out to the pool area, she turned to her right and she witnessed … her friend having sex with Rep. Gaetz. And her friend at that time was 17.”
Leppard said both of his clients testified to the congressional panel that they received payments for sex from Gaetz, usually via Venmo or PayPal, from the summer of 2017 through the beginning of 2019. Leppard said there were “numerous events” at which his clients were paid for sex by the Florida congressman.
“There were events at Airbnbs. There were events at individuals’ houses. There were events that took place at political events,” Leppard said. “There was a trip to New York. There’s a trip to Bahamas. So events like this did happen from time to time, perhaps over 10 times over the course of July 2017 to early January 2019.”
Gaetz has specifically denied ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex. Asked Friday about the testimony from Leppard’s client who says she witnessed Gaetz having sex with the minor, a spokesperson for Gaetz told CNN that “Merrick Garland’s DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn’t charge him.”
The House ethics investigation, which began in 2021, was in addition to a Justice Department criminal probe, launched under the first Trump administration, that was ultimately closed last year without charges against Gaetz.

Trump is calling senators directly to lobby for Gaetz AG confirmation as House Republicans weigh burying ethics report on him
CNN reported in January that the House committee had reached out to the formerly underage woman for testimony as it expanded its ethics probe into Gaetz. The committee said in June that it was continuing to investigate allegations that Gaetz may have “engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, dispensed special privileges and favors to individuals with whom he had a personal relationship, and sought to obstruct government investigations of his conduct.”
A lawyer for the formerly underage woman has called for the panel to release its final report on the Gaetz ethics probe.
“Mr. Gaetz’s likely nomination as Attorney General is a perverse development in a truly dark series of events. We would support the House Ethics Committee immediately releasing their report. She was a high school student and there were witnesses,” the lawyer, John Clune, tweeted last week.
Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have asked for the House panel to turn over its report as well as the underlying materials from the congressional investigation. Some Senate Republicans have also expressed interest in seeing the report, but House Speaker Mike Johnson has come out against its release. All 10 members of the House ethics panel have access to the draft report, CNN reported earlier Monday.
After its yearslong sex-trafficking investigation, the Justice Department decided not to bring criminal charges against Gaetz. CNN previously reported that prosecutors working on the case recommended against charging Gaetz because of questions over whether the central witnesses would be perceived as credible before a jury.
Sources close to the alleged victim have rebutted any suggestion that she was not credible.
“Any first-year law student can tell you that just because a career prosecutor who might have never lost a case decided not to bring charges for perhaps reasons that we don’t know about, doesn’t mean that someone’s innocent,” Leppard told Burnett.
He said his clients are also hoping for the release of the report.
“They want the truth to be known, and they don’t want everything that they have done to be in vain,” Leppard said.

219,General Politics,2024,11,Trump is calling senators directly to lobby for Gaetz AG confirmation as House Republicans weigh burying ethics report on him,Kristen Holmes,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump is doubling down on his efforts to ensure former Rep. Matt Gaetz is confirmed as attorney general, calling some senators directly to discuss the Florida Republican and ask for their support, two sources familiar with the outreach told CNN.
Neither source disclosed whom Trump had reached out to, but they stressed that the president-elect had reiterated to allies how determined he is to get Gaetz confirmed.
Republicans on the House Ethics Committee, meanwhile, are weighing whether to bury a potentially damaging report on the former congressman after their investigation into him was shelved and the public release of the findings thrown into question.
Some Republican members of the panel are signaling both publicly and privately that they do not believe the report should be released, suggesting that the panel could side with Republicans like House Speaker Mike Johnson who has called for the committee to block the report from being made public.
At this point, House Republicans say the report is not ready for public release, which Democrats view as an attempt to bury the findings. But a growing number of GOP senators say the House report is essential to vetting a nominee for a critical post, setting up a potential clash between the two chambers.
The president-elect has asked allies about the likelihood of Gaetz being confirmed but has not been deterred in his efforts, despite some hesitation from those around him, multiple sources briefed on the conversations told CNN.
Trump allies have also discussed how to use the Federal Vacancies Reform Act to put Gaetz in place, which would potentially allow him to temporarily make Gaetz head of the Department of Justice in an “acting” capacity for an extended period of time.
Axios was first to report on the president-elect’s calls to senators.
Trump views Gaetz as key to Cabinet
Gaetz’s selection was almost immediately complicated by the existing House ethics probe into allegations of misconduct, including “sexual misconduct and illicit drug use.” Gaetz resigned from Congress after Trump’s announcement and shortly before the committee was expected to release details of its findings. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex.
Trump’s insistence on the controversial nomination has, as CNN previously reported, drawn warnings from allies and lawmakers, who caution that Gaetz faces an uphill climb to secure the 51 votes needed for Senate approval. There is growing concern, too, that the spectacle of a Gaetz confirmation hearing might overshadow the priorities on which Trump has spent the last two years campaigning and for which he received a mandate to push through with his victory this month.
Yet the president-elect has made clear that he views Gaetz as the most important member of the Cabinet he is quickly assembling, sources with knowledge of Trump’s thinking told CNN, and he considers the nomination of the former Florida congressman an urgent priority for the new GOP majority in the Senate.
Trump wants Gaetz confirmed “100%,” a source told CNN. “He is not going to back off. He’s all in.”
Trump made his pick for attorney general hastily amid dissatisfaction with other potential candidates, but he has nevertheless grown enamored with the idea of having a political arsonist like Gaetz overseeing his promises to dismantle the Justice Department. He also believes Gaetz is uniquely positioned to defend the Trump administration on television, an attribute prioritized by the president-elect.
Trump’s pick for deputy attorney general — his defense attorney Todd Blanche — will carry out the day-to-day work of overseeing the Justice Department’s more than 40 agencies and 115,000 employees.
Fate of Gaetz ethics report in question
Gaetz’s potential confirmation has been complicated by growing calls from Senate Republicans for the House ethics panel to release its report on him.
Republicans on the panel, who have met at least once since Trump tapped Gaetz for his Cabinet, triggering his resignation, have yet to hold a full committee meeting to discuss the next steps with the report after cancelling a planned meeting last week. Some on the panel believe the group’s next meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, could again be pushed by Republicans, two sources told CNN.
The secretive panel still has to vote on whether to release the report, and it would only take one Republican lawmaker to break ranks and side with Democrats on the panel to change the fate of the report, as the 10-person committee is comprised equally of Democrats and Republicans.
The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Susan Wild, told reporters that “everybody on the committee now has the report, so they’ve got the opportunity to be reviewing it.”
Johnson, however, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday that the report is “not finished” and is only in “rough draft form.”
Even as Republicans say the report that members have access to is not final, one source said that the current version includes the thrust of the key findings from the multi-year investigation, and that any further changes would be minor.
Wild predicted that when members do finally meet “I believe there will be a unanimous democratic consensus that [the report] should be released.”
With the impression that Republicans are trying to delay the process, Democrats are beginning to weigh what steps – if any – they can take, according to the sources. But lawmakers want to wait until they meet with their Republican counterparts to get a better read on the situation before assessing potential next steps.
As the fate of the report remains up in the air, both sides are judiciously studying precedent and committee procedures.
Democrats have been reviewing the instances where the Ethics Committee released its findings after an individual left Congress.
“There is plenty of precedence in the Ethics Committee to disclose the report even after a member has resigned,” Wild said.
While Republicans have argued that since Gaetz resigned from Congress when Trump tapped him for attorney general, the investigation into the former congressman is closed and therefore the report should not be released.
“The speaker of the House is not involved in Ethics Committee work, can’t be, shouldn’t be, because the speaker can’t put a thumb on the scale or have anything to do with that. So I have no idea what the contents of this report would be,” Johnson said on Sunday. “What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member.”

 — 
A Russian man has been extradited from South Korea to the US to face charges in connection with a ransomware gang that allegedly extorted more than $16 million from victims around the world, US prosecutors said Monday.
42-year-old Evgenii Ptitsyn is accused of administering the sale, distribution and operation of Phobos, a type of ransomware that has been used in more than 1,000 ransomware attacks on public and private organizations, the Justice Department said. Victims of the ransomware include government agencies, health care facilities and schools.
The news is a win for the FBI, which typically has to wait until alleged ransomware kingpins leave Russia to try to arrest them because the US and Russia do not have an extradition treaty. Last year, ransomware operatives using Phobos extorted a North Carolina-based children’s hospital for about $100,000, and a California-based public school system for about $300,000, according to the indictment.
Ptitsyn faces wire and computer fraud conspiracy charges, among others. He made his initial court appearance in the District of Maryland on November 4, the Justice Department said. CNN is trying to locate a lawyer for Ptitsyn for comment.
Ptitsyn allegedly had a senior role in the Phobos ransomware group, overseeing a cryptocurrency wallet that collected payments from “affiliates,” or hackers who paid for access to the ransomware. The ransomware has been around since at least 2019, according to cybersecurity researchers.
The arrest of Ptitsyn is the latest example of an aggressive Justice Department effort to try to combat the scourge of ransomware, which has caused many millions of dollars in losses for American companies, schools and hospitals.

221,General Politics,2024,11,Biden administration requesting roughly $100 billion for disaster relief,Betsy Klein,"Washington
CNN
 — 
The Biden administration is sending a roughly $100 billion request to Congress to help Americans impacted by a series of major and record-breaking natural disasters in 2023 and 2024, including Hurricanes Helene and Milton, calling on lawmakers to pass the needed relief with “bipartisan and bicameral support.”
It includes $40 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Disaster Relief Fund, after the federal government rapidly spent a recent infusion of around $20 billion from Congress to respond to hurricane season after it ran out of money amid other tornadoes, wildfires and floods.
The whopping topline number is roughly five times the amount Congress initially gave FEMA in its yearly budget process. Congress granted FEMA’s major disasters fund $20.2 billion for the 2024 fiscal year, according to a Congressional Research Service report. But a constant stream of deadly and destructive storms, wildfires and drained the agency’s coffers again and again.
The request includes funding for a number of other key areas of assistance for those impacted by natural disasters, including $24 billion for the Department of Agriculture to help farmers that experienced crop or livestock losses, $12 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s block grant disaster recovery funding for communities, $8 billion for the Department of Transportation for road and bridge repair, $4 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency for water system upgrades, and $2 billion for the Small Business Administration’s disaster loan program for businesses, homeowners, renters, and other nonprofit organizations.
Congressional leadership will now have to decide how to take up the request – either as a standalone bill or packaged with the end-of-year spending bill.
There are minimal weeks left on the legislative calendar and Republicans are set to take control of both chambers of Congress in the new year. But there is a recognition on both sides of the aisle that getting aid passed is a priority. A senior administration official called on lawmakers to pass the additional funding “as quickly as possible,” and a Republican aide told CNN, “We need to do it this year if possible.”
The request is aimed at providing much-needed relief for Americans “still picking up the pieces” from the major back-to-back Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which struck the southeastern United States in September and October, as well as recent “severe storms in Alaska, Connecticut, Louisiana, New Mexico, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Illinois,” White House Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young said in a memo to interested parties earlier Monday.
Under FEMA’s “immediate needs funding posture,” which prioritizes funding for life saving and life-sustaining activities, the agency’s administrator Deanne Criswell warned that “FEMA will not have enough funding to get through fiscal year 2025. Additional funding is needed to ensure that we can support communities and achieve our mission.”
The request comes as Criswell’s agency is under scrutiny after an employee was fired for advising their disaster relief team to avoid homes with signs supporting now-President-elect Donald Trump while canvassing in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Milton. Pressed on the ongoing investigation, a senior administration official declined to comment but said FEMA’s mission is “to help people before, during, and after disasters, and our core values are fairness, respect, integrity, and compassion.”
A senior official declined to weigh in on the administration’s preferred vehicle for the additional funding, but officials repeatedly stressed the urgency of supporting impacted communities as climate change poses more extreme weather events.
“This request of supplemental funds is focused on the accounts that are most critical to aiding disaster survivors and impacted communities,” President Joe Biden said in a Monday letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson obtained by CNN.
Biden continued: “I urge the Congress to take immediate action.”
Young called on lawmakers to work together to pass the bill on a bipartisan basis, pointing to a long history of aid in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina, Sandy, and others.
“There’s no room for politics in disaster relief,” Young said.
“The Biden Harris administration stands ready to work with lawmakers to deliver the vital resources our communities need and expect with strong bipartisan and bicameral support,” she added.

223,General Politics,2024,11,Trump expands pool of possible Treasury picks as top candidates jockey for the job,Kayla Tausche,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump is casting a wider net for Treasury secretary after jockeying among his top two candidates sent him looking for an alternative solution, according to multiple people familiar with the process.
Trump is now considering Kevin Warsh, a former investment banker and former Federal Reserve governor whom Trump has often consulted for economic advice, and Marc Rowan, the billionaire co-founder of private equity firm Apollo Global Management, these people said.
Trump has a personal affinity for Warsh, who is married to an heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetic fortune. Warsh has been on Trump’s shortlist for chairman of the Federal Reserve for years and has remained a close member of his orbit.
Rowan, on the other hand, has the backing of many close Trump allies, including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has consulted with Rowan on foreign and economic policy. Kushner enlisted Rowan to participate in a meeting with the Qatari prime minister in 2023 on the conflict in the Middle East, and Rowan in 2020 made suggestions to Kushner for loosening qualifications on a pandemic-era lending program. Apollo has also extended loans to Kushner Companies to refinance debt on a Chicago skyscraper.
Tennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty visited Mar-a-Lago over the weekend to interview for a variety of roles, and two sources said he remains in the mix for Treasury. Hagerty ran his own eponymous private equity and investment firm and has served on the boards of directors of several companies before re-entering politics. During Trump’s first term, he served as US ambassador to Japan before resigning in 2019 to run for the Senate.
Treasury secretary is seen as the top financial job in any administration and has become a trophy position for many well-heeled Wall Street donors. The expanded slate of potential Trump picks comes after a week of bitter infighting among the top two candidates — hedge fund manager Scott Bessent and Cantor Fitzgerald chief executive Howard Lutnick, who also co-chairs the Trump transition — that led the president-elect to scrap a decision he expected to announce on Friday after markets closed.
A full week before that, Trump had been nearing a decision to name Bessent to the post. Allies said Trump liked his billionaire bona fides and the fact that he converted to the MAGA movement after working for Democratic financier George Soros. Meanwhile, an aggressive campaign from Lutnick has earned the support of Trump acolytes Elon Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – the president-elect’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary – but seriously irked others in Trump’s camp and may have caused him to sour on his transition co-chair.
Bessent, who has led a more understated quest for the role compared to the brash self-promotion aides describe of Lutnick, called Musk on Saturday to try to win him over before the tech billionaire attended a United Fighting Championship with Trump in New York City. Musk, however, had posted on X in support of Lutnick. “My view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice,” he wrote on X Saturday morning, whereas Lutnick “will actually enact change.”
Both Bessent and Lutnick are expected to get roles within the administration, but those exact titles remain unclear. Bessent is believed to be a contender to lead Trump’s National Economic Council if he is not selected for Treasury, sources said.
Amid the infighting and indecision – and with the markets on edge awaiting a name – Trump waded into the debate on Truth Social on Thursday by announcing whom he would not be selecting: Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who has praised Trump’s policies but recently had been aligning himself with Vice President Kamala Harris.

224,General Politics,2024,11,Biden admin sanctions Israeli West Bank settlement organization,Jennifer Hansler,"CNN
 — 
The Biden administration on Monday imposed sanctions on Israel’s largest settlement development organization as part of the latest US actions targeting those fomenting instability in the occupied West Bank.
The administration has issued a number of rounds of sanctions after President Joe Biden issued an executive order in February allowing sanctions on those undermining “peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.” The latest action comes amid a push from Democrats for Biden to act in his final months in office to impose sanctions on two far-right Israeli ministers – Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir – for their roles in inciting settler violence in the West Bank and as frustration grows from within Biden’s own party about his administration’s seeming unwillingness to penalize the Israeli government.
President-elect Donald Trump is unlikely to take any punitive actions against Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank – instead, his policies are likely to embrace them. His pick for US Ambassador to Israel, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, is staunchly pro-Israel and has voiced support for Israeli occupation in the Palestinian territory.
The sanctions from the US Treasury Department Monday hit Amana, “the largest organization involved in settlement and illegal outpost development in the West Bank” that has “established dozens of illegal settler outposts and directly engaged in dispossession of private land owned by Palestinians in its support of settlers,” according to the State Department.
The organization “maintains ties to various persons previously sanctioned by the U.S. government and its partners for perpetrating violence in the West Bank,” the Treasury Department said in a press release. The Treasury Department also sanctioned Amana’s subsidiary Binyanei Bar Amana Ltd., “a construction and development company that builds and sells homes in settlements and outposts in the West Bank.”
In a concurrent action, the US State Department imposed sanctions on three companies and three people “for their roles in violence targeting civilians or in the destruction or dispossession of property.”
A group of nearly 90 congressional Democrats urged Biden in a late October letter to impose sanctions on Smotrich and Ben Gvir. They publicly released the letter last week in order to increase pressure on the administration.
The letter had also pushed for sanctions on Amana, which was sanctioned Monday.

CNN
 — 
Donald Trump’s influence is already causing behind-the-scenes drama as Group of 20 talks are getting underway here this week after one of Trump’s top global allies put up resistance to a joint leaders’ statement, a move diplomats interpreted as meant to curry favor with the incoming administration.
Argentine President Javier Milei, who last week became the first world leader to meet face-to-face with Trump since his election, threatened to block a final communiqué over disputes about language related to taxation on the ultra-rich and gender issues, according to two diplomats familiar with the matter.
While it’s not unusual for leaders’ summits to involve some back-and-forth over a final statement, Milei’s roadblocks were seen by diplomats as curious since Argentina had already agreed to a declaration about taxing the ultra-rich over the summer — only to reverse itself after Trump was elected president.
It was just one example of Trump casting a long shadow over a pair of world leader summits taking place in South America this week. Even as President Joe Biden works during his final major summits to promote American leadership and burnish his legacy, leaders are looking past him and toward the next occupant of the Oval Office.

Trump’s string of surprising selections for important Cabinet posts last week was a dominant topic of conversation in private back-hallway conversations among delegations at the APEC summit in Peru, according to diplomats, particularly the choice of former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to lead US intelligence services and Fox News host Pete Hegseth to head up the Pentagon.
“Everyone was talking about the new cast of characters,” one Asian diplomat said after the summit had ended.
And though Trump did not directly arise during Biden’s conversations with the leaders of Japan, South Korea and Peru, according to White House officials, his return was hinted at during Chinese President Xi Jinping’s opening remarks during his final summit with Biden on Saturday.
“China is ready to work with the new U.S. administration to maintain communication, expand cooperation and manage differences,” Xi said as his meeting with Biden got underway.
Biden, who spent two hours speaking with Trump in the Oval Office before flying to Lima, has not been able to offer any specifics about what the new administration might has in store.
“The incoming administration is not in the business of providing us assurances about anything, and they’ll make their own decisions as they go forward,” Biden’s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Saturday after the meeting with Xi.

Still, for leaders wondering what the next four years will hold, the dispute over the final G20 statement might offer a clue.
Officials gathering in Rio said they believed Milei was emboldened by Trump’s election and was looking to lay the groundwork for a new center of power among likeminded leaders even before Trump takes office.
Brazilian officials were working to patch up the differences ahead of the summit’s start, and it was possible the communiqué would note Argentina’s opposition in the sections it would not sign onto.

Yet to many involved in the discussions, the episode suggested the contention that colored world leader summits during Trump’s first presidency may be poised to return.
“You can already see the Trump effect taking hold,” one Western diplomat said as the summit was getting underway. “Conservatives like Milei are angling to create an alliance with him before he even comes into office. It’s a preview of what the next four years will look like.”
In Rio, Biden was scheduled to attend an event on combating hunger and poverty, and he is expected to make new US pledges on climate and development, though many of his fellow leaders now regard those as symbolic moves that will be swiftly erased by the incoming administration.
On Sunday, Biden acknowledged his time in office was short.
“It’s no secret that I’m leaving office in January,” Biden said after an aerial tour of the Amazon, where a two-year drought has led to wildfires and dried-up riverbeds. “I will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.”
Another official in Rio voiced concerns that Trump’s expected withdrawal from agreements like the Paris climate accord could inspire leaders like Milei to follow suit, leading to major fractures in the group.

“(The Ukraine war) is already pitting countries against each other,” the official said. Russia is a member of the G20, and many countries in the bloc — particularly those in the so-called Global South — have not joined in western attempts to punish Moscow.
“Trump will only cause more divisions, and more divisions mean less leverage and less influence,” the official went on.
Speaking Monday morning, a top aide to Biden acknowledged countries were looking ahead to the transition in the US. But he said Biden was still commander in chief.
“We have a system, fundamentally, that’s predicated on one president at a time,” said Jon Finer, deputy national security adviser. “President Biden is that president, he will be handing off power in January, and it will be up to a new administration to decide what to do with it.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/politics/g20-leader-reaction-trump/index.html
226,General Politics,2024,11,Biden authorizes Ukraine to use long-range US weapons in Russia,Kevin Liptak,"CNN
 — 
President Joe Biden has authorized Ukraine to use powerful long-range American weapons inside Russia, according to two US officials familiar with the decision, as North Korean troops deploy in support of Moscow’s effort.
The decision comes as Moscow has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk, the southern Russian region where Kyiv launched its surprise counteroffensive in the summer, to prepare to take back territory.
The weapons are intended to be used primarily in Kursk for now, a US official said. With its huge troop amassment there, Russia is trying to take Kursk off the table as a potential bargaining chip for the Ukrainians in any future peace talks, something that the US does not want to see. The idea is to help Ukraine hold on to Kursk for as long as possible, the official said.
Thousands of North Korean troops have deployed to Kursk as part of Russia’s offensive, sparking concern from Biden and his advisers that their entry could lead to a dangerous new phase in the war.
ANALYSIS
Biden’s green light for Ukraine to use ATACMS just raised the stakes in a war Trump will inherit
The decision to allow the use of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, inside Russia had been under consideration for months. American officials had been divided on the wisdom of allowing the new capability. Some had concerns about escalating the war, while others worried about dwindling stockpiles of the weapons.
The US refused to even provide ATACMS to Ukraine for the first two years of the war, in part because of readiness concerns as the powerful missiles require time and complex components to produce. But Biden secretly approved the transfer of the long-range ATACMS missiles in February for use inside Ukrainian territory, and the US delivered the missiles in April.
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky had been pressing Washington to allow use of the weapons inside Russia, too, arguing he needed the capability to gain momentum in his war effort.
When Biden and Zelensky last met at the White House in September, the Ukrainian leader came with a detailed list of targets inside Russia that he wanted to hit with US-provided long-range missiles, according to sources familiar with the meeting.
The list was a key part of Zelensky’s “victory plan” for winning the war. Biden, who nearly three years into the war had prohibited the Ukrainians from deploying the missile systems for deep strikes into Russia, was not entirely dismissive of the request, the sources said. But he was ultimately noncommittal, and the leaders agreed to keep discussing the issue.
Zelensky responded to the news Sunday, saying on Telegram, “Missiles will speak for themselves.”
“Today, there is a lot of talk in the media about us receiving a permit for respective actions. Hits are not made with words. Such things don’t need announcements. Missiles will speak for themselves,” he said.
ANALYSIS
Bad news mounts for Ukraine across the frontlines. But Russia is under pressure too
President Vladimir Putin in September warned the West that Russia could use nuclear weapons if it was struck with conventional missiles, and that Moscow would consider any assault supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. The declaration was the Kremlin’s answer to deliberations at the time in the US and Britain about whether to give Ukraine permission to fire conventional Western missiles into Russia.
For months, US officials provided a litany of reasons why changing the policy would not make a substantial difference. Chief among those was the limited supply of ATACMS that Kyiv had received from the Biden administration, a finite stockpile that could not be quickly replenished because of the long lead time on producing the advanced missiles. US officials also argued that Ukraine has its own burgeoning drone industry that is able to manufacture one-way attack drones with longer ranges than ATACMS.
The approximate 200-mile range of the US long-range missiles was not far enough to inflict substantive damage on one of the most important targets: the Russian aircraft launching powerful long-range glide bombs that have devastated Ukrainian targets. One US official estimated that 90% of those aircraft were outside the range of ATACMS, as Russia pulled key targets farther from the front line.
The Biden administration had rebuffed Ukraine’s requests to change its position on the long-range missiles, but like so many other ostensibly rigid policies established over nearly three years of war — including on Patriot missiles, Abrams tanks and F-16 fighter jets — the White House ultimately relented
It’s unclear whether the administration will provide more ATACMS to Ukraine with the $7.1 billion remaining in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the military to pull stocks directly from US inventories to send to Kyiv, or whether the policy will apply only to the relatively few missiles that Ukraine still has.
The US and its allies had been working to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs through the end of 2025 as a way a way to “Trump-proof” US security aid. President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that the Ukraine-Russia war would not have started if he had been commander in chief.
Zelensky on Friday said the war “will end faster with the policy of this team that will now lead the White House,” referring to the incoming Trump administration. Trump has said he could settle the war in one day, without saying how he would do so.

Zelensky says Ukraine war will end ‘faster’ under Trump presidency
A Trump transition spokesperson declined Sunday to address reports that Biden had authorized Ukraine to use long-range American missiles inside Russia.
“As President Trump has said on the campaign trail, he is the only person who can bring both sides together in order to negotiate peace, and work towards ending the war and stopping the killing,” Trump communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement to CNN.
Cheung did not respond to questions about whether Trump or his incoming national security advisers had received advance warning from the Biden administration about a decision that could have profound implications on the war between Ukraine and Russia.
Biden’s authorization comes after the US State Department said Tuesday that 10,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to Russia and “have begun engaging in combat operations with Russian forces” in the Kursk region, where Ukraine’s three-month military incursion has stalled.
A Ukrainian commander previously told CNN that North Korean troops were a “significant resource” for Moscow’s war on Ukraine, as even those being deployed defensively would free up Russian troops for assault operations elsewhere and would eventually be used in direct combat.

227,General Politics,2024,11,Florida court fight gives insight into the House review of sex allegations against Matt Gaetz,Paula Reid,"CNN
 — 
Accounts of parties involving drugs, alcohol and young women that were allegedly attended by President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, Matt Gaetz, are in the hands of House ethics investigators under pressure to release its findings on the former Florida congressman.
The evidence related to some of the salacious allegations against Gaetz surfaced in a civil lawsuit brought by one friend of the Florida Republican against another ex-Gaetz associate, now in prison.
Several witnesses who gave depositions in the civil case – including the woman whom Gaetz is accused of having sex with when she was a minor in 2017 – have testified to the House committee.
The House Ethics Committee probe into Gaetz, initially launched in 2021, ran into several obstacles, including a lack of access to records collected by a federal criminal investigation into Gaetz. However, the congressional investigation picked up steam once lawmakers were pointed in the direction of the civil lawsuit, which has played out in Orlando federal court over the last 18 months. Key evidence there remains under seal, but congressional investigators have obtained other non-public evidence in the case, sources told CNN.

Trump is determined to see Gaetz confirmed as AG despite controversies
What happens to the materials collected by the House ethics panel, including a draft report that was queued up for release before Gaetz resigned to pursue the attorney general post, is a major question for lawmakers as the Senate weighs whether to confirm the former congressman, one of the most contentious of several controversial picks by Trump for his Cabinet.
“If the report includes the information the committee received from the (civil) litigation, it would be highly damaging to the congressman,” a source familiar with the congressional investigation told CNN.
In addition to the House Ethics Committee investigation, Gaetz was separately investigated by the US Justice Department for alleged sex trafficking, obstruction of justice and other potential crimes, but prosecutors declined to bring any charges.
Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, including ever having sex with a minor or paying for sex.
“These allegations are invented and would constitute false testimony to Congress,” Gaetz said in a statement to CNN. “This false smear following a three-year criminal investigation should be viewed with great skepticism.”
It’s not clear what information uncovered by ethics investigators made it into the final report. Notably, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will consider Gaetz’s nomination, have requested that the ethics panel hand over not just its report but the underlying materials as well. A lawyer for the formerly underage woman also has called for the report’s release.
However, some witnesses who participated in both the DOJ and Hill investigations are not eager to see the report be made public, people familiar with their thinking told CNN, as those witnesses are hoping to move on with their lives.
The House committee abandoned plans for a closed-door meeting Friday, when lawmakers were expected to consider the release of the report.
One Gaetz friend sues another
Gaetz got on the radar of Justice Department criminal investigators as part of a sprawling investigation into his former associate, Joel Greenberg, who, after initially facing 33 counts, pleaded guilty in 2021 to six federal charges, including sex trafficking of a child.
Greenberg, a former Seminole County tax collector, is serving an 11-year prison sentence and cooperated with federal investigators.
Ultimately, the federal case against Gaetz was closed last year after prosecutors recommended that no charges be brought against the congressman. However, the House Ethics Committee investigation into Gaetz – who took his hostile relationship with House leadership to the next level by leading last year’s overthrow of Kevin McCarthy as speaker – was revived after the DOJ concluded its case.
Meanwhile, Christopher Dorworth, a Gaetz friend, businessman and owner of the Florida house where the alleged 2017 sexual encounter with the underage girl occurred, sued Greenberg and members of his family, accusing them of conspiring to make several false claims about him because Dorworth refused to help Greenberg secure a pardon from Trump. Dorworth, a former Florida House member, also sued the underage victim.

The litigation resulted in an extensive discovery process, including depositions with key witnesses who also participated in the Justice Department probe but had never spoken publicly. The formerly underage woman and her friend who brought her to the party both testified in the case. Gaetz’s ex-girlfriend provided an affidavit.
The women’s depositions remain under seal. But a lengthy two-day deposition of Dorworth and other discovery materials obtained in the civil case are public. In the deposition, the attorneys questioning Dorworth recited portions of the deposition transcripts that are under seal and specifically describe the claims of the formerly underage woman. In one line of questioning, the attorneys recounted that she had testified having sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table at Dorworth’s house while Dorworth watched.
Dorworth vehemently denied the claim in the deposition, testifying he did not know the woman and saying he wasn’t even at his own house during the gathering in question.
The friend of the underage woman who brought her to the party testified that she too had sex with Gaetz at the same gathering, according to the description of her testimony in the Dorworth deposition.
When asked about the friend’s claim she had sex with Gaetz, Dorworth suggested in the deposition that both women made up their stories.

“The thing I didn’t really contemplate when this whole thing started was the idea that people would lie themselves into these stories because of Matt’s political celebrity,” Dorworth said. “I truly believe that is what happened.”
The friend additionally attested that at the party, she and the underage woman had access to “alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy also known as molly, and marijuana,” according to parts from her sealed affidavit that were quoted in another public document in the case.
Another woman, identified only as “LP” in court documents, filed an affidavit in the case alleging that she was present at a party a week later that summer with “alcohol, drugs, middle-aged men and young and attractive women,” and said that Gaetz was among the attendees.
Dorworth dropped the lawsuit in September, but his deposition and other records in the case became public as part of an ongoing fight over whether the individuals he sued were entitled to attorneys’ fees. The Miami Herald is also seeking to unseal more of the records in the case.
Attorneys also questioned Dorworth about a trip to the Bahamas that Gaetz took with the woman who brought the 17-year-old to the party and the formerly underage woman, who may have been 18 by the time of the trip.
In his deposition, Dorworth said he believed both women who traveled with Gaetz to the Bahamas were adults at the time of the trip.
Resignation brings House probe to a halt
The House Ethics Committee probe was started by House Democrats in 2021 but was put on hold while the Justice Department completed its criminal investigation.
When the committee eventually returned to its investigation, it appeared to struggle without access to Justice Department records, people with knowledge of the House investigation told CNN.

One witness who spoke with Hill investigators early last year described them to be “out of their depth” and said they asked questions that appeared to be “based off of news reports.”
Then, in mid-2024, the committee turned its attention to Dorworth’s civil litigation, which provided a trove of evidence. Congressional investigators got access to both the public and non-public records from the case, and also brought in witnesses for testimony, sources told CNN.
The House committee had plans to meet and release the report last week, but those plans were disrupted by Trump’s announcement he had selected Gaetz as his attorney general pick. With the news, Gaetz almost immediately submitted his resignation – a move that effectively forced the ethics probe to end and put in jeopardy the release of its report.

 — 
When President-elect Donald Trump tapped Matt Gaetz for attorney general, he elevated a MAGA firebrand with a penchant for stoking controversy and a history of getting out of trouble to lead a Justice Department that has investigated both men.
Gaetz, a career politician with limited experience practicing law, resigned from his seat in Congress just hours after Trump announced earlier this week his intention to nominate him as the top federal law enforcement officer in the United States.
The Florida Republican has a tense history with the Justice Department, clashing with officials during contentious oversight hearings where he accused the department of being “weaponized” against Trump and fellow conservatives and decrying the yearslong federal sex-crimes investigation of him that began during the Trump administration. (Prosecutors ultimately declined to charge him.)

Gaetz would be able to take on the Justice Department from the inside, molding the institution and its law enforcement components, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, to fit his vision — and Trump’s.
Democrats on Capitol Hill and some legal scholars have flatly said Gaetz is unqualified for the job, and even people close to Gaetz told CNN they are concerned he may not be a good fit at the department and may have trouble winning confirmation by the Senate if there’s a vote on his nomination.
But many Republicans and Gaetz allies have touted his aggressive style as an essential attribute for an attorney general. Sources close to Trump said he sees Gaetz as an effective messenger of his agenda and believes his appointees to other top positions at the Justice Department can handle day-to-day duties.
John Morgan, a Florida personal injury attorney and Democratic donor who is nevertheless close to Gaetz, warned doubters not to dismiss the Panhandle Republican as the right-wing caricature he often embodies. Morgan called Gaetz “uber smart” and “a pit bull.”
“Everyone who has underestimated him has done so at their own peril,” Morgan said. “I don’t think that everyone needs to be getting scared. Matt knows what it’s like to be unfairly targeted and I don’t think he’ll do that.”
Reaction inside the Beltway
Inside the Justice Department, some employees who had braced for the possibility of other names that had surfaced early in the transition were appalled when Trump made the Gaetz announcement. He would mark a sharp departure from Attorney General Merrick Garland, who was chosen by President Joe Biden for his low-key style and promise to try to restore decades-old norms to the department after a chaotic first Trump term.
One career official described hearing audible cries of “oh my God” echoing down the hallway inside DOJ’s headquarters.
Even among Trump transition officials who had spent weeks preparing potential nominees for Trump to review were taken aback, in part because it meant all the work they had done was cast aside for a choice that came from Trump’s gut, a person close to the transition said.
Some Justice officials believe the Gaetz pick raises the likelihood there will be more departures, either voluntarily or as part of efforts to push out employees who aren’t seen as loyal to the incoming Trump administration.

Trump is determined to see Gaetz confirmed as AG despite controversies
A staffing firm that moves lawyers out of government into private-sector jobs said they have been inundated with calls since Trump’s announcement Wednesday afternoon.
A former official who worked at the Justice Department during Trump’s first term told CNN they are concerned about Gaetz’s nomination and “praying” that those tapped to run each department inside the main headquarters can keep things on course.
The president-elect filled some of those spots Thursday evening, appointing a series of his own personal lawyers to run key sections of the Justice Department. Trump said he intends to nominate Todd Blanche, who played a central role in his defense teams in the Manhattan hush money case and two federal criminal cases, to be the second in command at the Justice Department as the deputy attorney general.
Trump also announced his selection of Emil Bove, another member of his criminal defense team, to be principal associate attorney general.
Florida law and politics
Gaetz, a lifelong Floridian, grew up as the son of a powerful state senator and living in the house used to film the movie “The Truman Show.” He graduated from Florida State University, and then from William & Mary Law School.
He worked for AnchorsGordon, a firm with a handful of lawyers in the Florida Panhandle that he joined after graduating law school. His courtroom experience is limited. He has never appeared as an attorney in a federal court case, according to the national court records database. He is listed as the attorney in seven cases in state court.
Partners at AnchorsGordon didn’t return multiple inquiries this week about Gaetz’s history in private practice. Gaetz last reported earning a paycheck from the firm in 2016.
He has maintained an active law license with the Florida Bar — apart from letting it lapse for failure to pay fees for 20 days in 2021, according to a spokesperson for the organization. While he doesn’t need a license to be attorney general, he would be the first in decades to come into the role without experience as a government attorney or a judge.
Gaetz was later influential in Trump’s 2018 nomination of one of his former law firm’s partners, Lawrence “Larry” Keefe, as US attorney for the Northern District of Florida. Keefe ultimately became Florida’s public safety czar under Gov. Ron DeSantis and played a critical role in orchestrating the flights that carried migrants from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard.

In Florida, where Gaetz first made his mark as a brash state lawmaker in 2010, his rise has left many in the state’s tightly knit political circles bewildered. Gaetz — often tagged “Baby Gaetz” by political insiders in the state, for his boyish looks as well as his political lineage — has been recognized as much for his provocations as he has been for his hardline conservative stance.
“I am stunned,” one longtime Florida Republican operative told CNN after learning about the Gaetz appointment.
After Gaetz left the Tallahassee statehouse, a former Republican state lawmaker alleged on X that he created a “game” at the Florida state house where he and his male colleagues earned points for sleeping with interns, staff and married legislators. Gaetz denied the allegation.
The Florida Bar once said Gaetz was “unprofessional, reckless, insensitive, and demonstrated poor judgment” for menacing tweets he posted about Trump’s former fixer, Michael Cohen, though the lawyer association ultimately declined to punish the behavior. The episode drew public scorn from some prominent Florida Republicans, including Sen. Rick Scott, who called Gaetz’s behavior “disgusting” and “embarrassing.”
Gaetz goes to Washington
Elected to Congress the same year Trump won the White House, Gaetz first arrived in the US House of Representative in 2017, and quickly became better known for his trademark incendiary political moves than legislating.
The congressman became a regular in conservative media and pulled stunts that often made him an obstacle for Republican Party leadership and unpopular in the House Republican conference. But Trump called Gaetz one his “absolute warriors” for regularly coming to his defense on cable television.
In 2018, Gaetz was criticized after he invited a conservative troll with a history of Holocaust denial to the State of the Union. And during the House’s first impeachment inquiry into Trump, Gaetz led a band of Republicans to “storm” the House Intelligence secure committee spaces where the impeachment interviews were being held.
And in 2020, Gaetz wore a gas mask on the House floor to vote on a coronavirus funding package. Gaetz, who said at the time that the move was “quite serious,” ultimately voted in support of the bill.
His own personal history has, at times, become part of the debate. During a congressional hearing where Gaetz railed against Hunter Biden’s cocaine use, Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson alluded to Gaetz’s arrest on suspicion of driving under the influence in 2008. The DUI charges were later dismissed.
Gaetz has said that he doesn’t think the public was “hanging on a traffic incident I had a decade ago.”
Gaetz also led the effort to oust former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and was even part of a physical dust-up on the House floor at the end of McCarthy’s tenure.
And while his antics turned off many of his own colleagues, Gaetz won over Trump and became a staunch ally.
He echoed Trump’s lies about the 2020 election being stolen and even defended him in the hours after the deadly January 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. When House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming voted to impeach Trump in January, Gaetz didn’t just criticize her — he traveled to Wyoming to hold a rally denouncing her.
Since Trump left office in 2020, Gaetz has alleged the Justice Department is “weaponized” against conservatives. From his perch on the powerful House Judiciary Committee, he accused the FBI of going “far beyond” what the law allows in surveillance, called for the FBI to be abolished, and lambasted prosecutions of Trump and January 6 rioters.
Now, while some of his colleagues in Congress expressed skepticism of his pick as attorney general, they said they are prepared for a detailed confirmation process.
When asked about his nomination, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told CNN: “I don’t know yet. I’ll have to think about that one.”
Under federal investigation
Gaetz has for years faced accusations that he may have violated federal law by paying for sex, including with a woman who was younger than 18 at the time. Gaetz denies any wrongdoing.
The investigation into Gaetz began in late 2020 under then-Attorney General Bill Barr, but ramped up significantly after Gaetz’s close friend, Joel Greenberg, pleaded guilty to six federal crimes and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors against the congressman.
That same year, Gaetz allegedly sought from Trump a preemptive presidential pardon relating to the sex-trafficking probe, an aide testified to the House Select Committee investigating January 6. He denies ever seeking a pardon.
Senior officials in Garland’s Justice Department ultimately decided not to charge Gaetz, and the files related to the FBI investigation were deemed too sensitive to release, even to congressional investigators who were conducting their own ethics probe into Gaetz.
The House Ethics Committee, which at the time was controlled by Democrats, originally opened an investigation into Gaetz in 2021, publicly announcing that it was examining a range of allegations including that Gaetz violated sex trafficking laws, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, converted campaign funds to personal use, and accepted a bribe, among other claims.
As attorney general, Gaetz would be in control of the FBI investigative files that detail the evidence the bureau uncovered. And now that he has resigned as a congressman, the House Ethics Committee probe into Gaetz has ended and its long-awaited report may never be made public.

229,General Politics,2024,11,Biden makes first presidential visit to the Amazon as incoming Trump administration poses a threat to climate fight,Kevin Liptak,"Rio de Janeiro
CNN
 — 
When President Joe Biden worked to burnish his climate legacy in the Brazilian Amazon on Sunday, the unspoken presence of Donald Trump shadowed the historic stop.
A sitting American president had never before set foot in the Amazon rainforest, and Biden wanted to use his presence in the vital environment to bring attention to his efforts curbing carbon emissions and helping the world guard against global warming.
Standing on a dirt path with lush palms and other foliage behind him, Biden described the fight against climate change as a “defining” part of his presidency.
But he also warned future administrations that undoing that work would risk depriving the world of its benefits. Without naming President-elect Trump, who has questioned whether climate change exists and vowed to reverse Biden policies on gas and oil exploration, Biden delivered a clear message to the country as he prepares to make way for the incoming Republican president.
ANALYSIS
Climate leaders were worried Trump would derail talks. They didn’t know their host would be the wrecking ball
“I will leave my successor and my country a strong foundation to build on if they choose to do so. It’s true, some may seek to deny or delay the clean energy revolution that’s underway in America. But nobody, nobody can reverse it. Nobody,” Biden said in remarks from Manaus, Brazil.
“Not when so many people regardless of party or politics are enjoying its benefits. Not when countries around the world are harnessing the clean energy revolution to pull ahead themselves. The question now is: Which government will stand in the way and which will seize the enormous economic opportunity?” he continued.
Before he spoke, Biden viewed dried-up river beds and wildfire damage on an aerial tour of the Amazon rainforest, getting a bird’s-eye view of some of the effects of a yearslong drought.
The half-hour tour aboard Marine One brought Biden to the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon rivers, where he saw ships that had been grounded due to low water levels, and over a wildlife preserve.
Among the moves he announced Sunday were tens of millions in US dollars directed toward preserving the Amazon, whose trees act as a sponge for massive amounts of carbon dioxide and which is being threatened by deforestation. And he pledged billions to help nations bolster resilience against climate change.

But whether any of the money makes it out the door will now largely be up to Trump, who has dismissed climate change — and who, a day before Biden’s trip, named a fracking industry executive as his pick for energy secretary.
Trump has already vowed to withdraw again from the Paris climate accord, which Biden entered back into when he took office four years ago. Trump and his team have pledged to ease restrictions on oil and gas exploration that Biden put in place. And the president-elect has cast a deeply skeptical eye toward foreign assistance of the type Biden announced Sunday.
That dynamic has led to skepticism among world leaders gathered for summits in South America this month that any of Biden’s announcements will last past January, when he exits the world stage.

230,Ukraine,2024,11,European officials cry sabotage after two internet cables are cut in the Baltic Sea,Ivana Kottasová,"CNN
 — 
European officials are looking toward Russia after two submarine internet cables in the Baltic Sea were suddenly disrupted in an apparent sabotage operation, just weeks after the United States warned that Moscow was likely to target critical undersea infrastructure.
A cable between Lithuania and Sweden was cut on Sunday, according to Telia Lithuania, the telecommunications company that runs the link. Separately, the state-controlled Finnish telecoms company Cinia said one of its cables, which connects Finland and Germany, was disrupted on Monday.
The Swedish Prosecution Authority said Tuesday that the country’s National Unit against International and Organized Crime had opened a preliminary investigation into suspected sabotage over the cut cables. Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation also said it had launched an investigation.
While the exact causes of the incidents are still being investigated, Germany’s Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he believed it was likely sabotage.
”Nobody believes that these cables were accidentally severed,” he told reporters on Tuesday morning ahead of a ministerial meeting in Brussels, Belgium. “We have to know that, without knowing specifically who it came from, that it is a hybrid action and we also have to assume that, without knowing by whom yet, that this is sabotage,“ Pistorius said.
His comments came after the foreign ministers of Finland and Germany said in a joint statement on Monday evening that they were “deeply concerned” about the severed cable between their nations, and raised the possibility of the incident being part of a “hybrid warfare.”
“The fact that such an incident immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage speaks volumes about the volatility of our times. A thorough investigation is underway,” the statement continued. “Our European security is not only under threat from Russia‘s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors.”
However, two US officials familiar with an initial assessment told CNN Tuesday that as yet there were “no indications of nefarious activity, nor intentional damage to seafloor infrastructure” and suggested the disruption was likely caused by an anchor dragged from a passing vessel.
Tracking data from Kpler and Spire did not show any ships near the area where the cables are believed to have been cut. All vessels above a certain tonnage are required by international law to have automatic identification systems that allow them to be tracked, and must keep them on at all times.
There are some instances where these might be turned off, and military ships are not required to have it turned on. Vessels that have it turned off are frequently involved in illicit operations such as oil smuggling and illegal fishing.
However, ship tracking data analyzed by CNN shows at least one ship crossing the Lithuania-Sweden cable.
The cutting of the cables on Sunday and Monday fits the pattern of attacks that have been linked to Russia. Additionally, it is no secret that Russia has been showing increased interest in undersea cables in recent months, patrolling close to critical maritime infrastructure often far from its shores.
Two US officials told CNN in September that the United States believed Russia was now more likely to carry out potential sabotage operations.
They said Moscow has been beefing up its dedicated secretive marine unit that deploys fleets of surface ships, submarines and naval drones to survey the seabed.
Known as “GUGI,” the Russian acronym for the “General Staff Main Directorate for Deep Sea Research,” the unit was previously spotted lurking around critical infrastructure.
A joint investigation by the public broadcasters of Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland found in April 2023 that Russia had deployed a fleet of suspected spy ships in Nordic waters as part of a program of potential sabotage of underwater cables and wind farms in the region.
Hybrid warfare
European security officials and experts have been warning for months that Russia was waging a hybrid war against the West – accusations prompted by a series of seemingly random arson attacks, hackings and explosions that occurred across multiple European cities in recent months.
These included arson attacks against a bus garage in the Czech capital of Prague, the Museum of Occupation in Riga, Latvia, a warehouse of a Ukrainian company in London and a shopping center in Warsaw, Poland. Multiple hacking attacks and spying incidents have also been reported in different European countries. As the same time, the European Union has accused Russia and Belarus of weaponizing migration by pushing asylum seekers from third countries to its borders.
Rod Thornton, a senior lecturer in defense studies at King’s College London, said that Moscow has been using sabotage as an alternative to a full-on war with NATO, which would be disastrous for Russia.
Instead, Russia is trying to cause disruption without crossing the threshold that would trigger a forceful response from NATO. The principle that an attack against one member country is an attack against the whole alliance is the cornerstone of the group’s defense pact.

Thornton said it was telling that the disruption happened at the time Russia is trying to increase pressure on Ukraine and the West.
“It could be seen as Russia ramping up the war and the effects of the war in Ukraine before (US President-elect Donald) Trump comes into power to increase the willingness of Western powers to bring an end to the war,” he told CNN in an interview.
“You can see how Trump wants to bring an end to the war, and if the Russians increase pressure on other Western countries and show them the effects of the war, then those Western countries might be more amenable to supporting Trump in his desire to have a ceasefire,” he explained.
Nobody has so far claimed responsibility for the damage. If Russia was behind it, it is unlikely to admit so.
All of the sabotage attacks that have been linked to Russia earlier this year had one thing in common: they were done in a way that allowed Moscow to deny any involvement, usually by low-level operatives or common criminals paid to conduct them.
“This is important because international institutions like the UN can’t blame Russia because the evidence isn’t there. The circumstantial evidence is there, but not the real evidence, there’s no actual kind of smoking gun that can be linked back to them,” Thornton said.
Oleksandr Danylyuk, an associate fellow at Royal United Services Institute, a UK defense and security think tank, and a former Ukrainian defense and foreign intelligence official, said this kind of deniability has long been Russia’s strategy.
“The idea is to conduct the operation in the way that everybody understands that it was done by Russia, but at the same time, it leaves some room for the victim to pretend they didn’t know, because the victim is not interested in escalation,” he said, also pointing to the events leading to the annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea by Russia in 2014.
“Those little green men, everybody knew that they were Russian forces, but because the West wasn’t ready, you know, to do anything, they could say ‘oh, it’s not certain, we should check what’s going on, maybe it’s some kind of local militia,’” he said.
Limited disruption
The extent of the disruption, if any, caused by the damage to the cables is unclear. Accidents that cause damage to undersea cables are rare, but they do happen, so most providers run services through several different routes to avoid blackouts.
The limited disruption could have been intentional, making the impact serious enough to be seen as an escalation, but not enough to spiral out of control, for now.
“It does take it that that one stage further, but it’s cutting a cable that isn’t going to offend too many countries. They could have gone to the Atlantic and cut a cable there between the US and the UK, or between Europe and the US, which could have major, major consequences, so this is a kind of warning shot,” Thornton said.
Cinia said in a statement that services running through the C-Lion1 cable that connects Helsinki with Rostock were down, but added that Finland’s international telecommunication connections were routed via multiple links.
The company said a repair vessel had been dispatched to the scene and, while it did not yet know how long it would take to fix the issue, added that it typically takes between five and 15 days for submarine cables to be repaired.
Telia Lithuania’s chief technology officer Andrius Šemeškevičius was quoted by Lithuanian media as saying that the cable that was disrupted – BCS East-West – handled roughly a third of Lithuania’s internet capacity. He added that traffic has been restored since the disruption.

Markets shook off any concern Tuesday about rising tensions between Russia and the United States.
The Dow ended the day down by 120 points, or 0.28%, after a volatile start. The blue-chip index dropped about 450 points shortly after the opening bell but swiftly rebounded. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also bounced back from early losses, closing out the day up by 0.4% and 1%, respectively.
The price action comes after Moscow changed its nuclear doctrine following the Biden administration giving Ukraine permission to use longer-range weapons inside targets in Russia.
“Today is a reflection of concern that, after 1,000 days, the Russia-Ukraine conflict looks like it’s getting hotter,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management.
Investors initially also piled into safe havens like gold and US debt. Gold prices increased on Tuesday and US Treasury rates dipped.
Ukraine fired US-made ATACMS missiles into Russia’s Bryansk region, Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday, in a major escalation.
The attack comes just two days after the Biden administration gave Kyiv the green light to use the longer-range American weapons against targets inside Russia. On Sunday, President Joe Biden authorized Ukraine to use the longer-range missiles inside Russia, ending a monthslong prohibition aimed to avoid drastically escalating the conflict.
Oil prices, which surged at the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, were little changed Tuesday.
“In our view, the underlying trends for the equity market remain positive, but this news provides an excuse for the market to give back some of its rally,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services.

Ukraine hit a Russian weapons arsenal with US-made ATACMS missiles that it fired across the border for the first time, according to two US officials, in a major escalation on the 1,000th day of war.
The attack comes just two days after the Biden administration gave Kyiv the green light to use the longer-range American weapons against targets inside Russia.
Russia’s Defense Ministry said Ukraine fired six ballistic missiles at a facility in Bryansk at 3:25 a.m. local time (7:25 p.m. ET) Tuesday and that ATACMS missiles had been used in the attack.

The attack marks the first time Ukraine has used the longer-range American weapons to strike targets deep inside Russia, and shows that Kyiv has wasted little time in making use of its newly-granted powers.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky declined to confirm or deny the attack during a Tuesday news conference but said: “Ukraine has long-range capabilities. Ukraine has long-range drones of its own production. We now have a long ‘Neptune’ (Ukrainian cruise missiles) and not just one. And now we have ATACMS. And we will use all of this.”
Russian air defenses said they shot down five of the missiles and another was damaged. Fragments from the damaged missile fell on the territory of a military facility, causing a fire that has since been extinguished. There were no casualties or damage.
On the same day of the attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine where Moscow will consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Russia.
In what appeared to be a fresh round of saber rattling, the Kremlin said Tuesday the revised military doctrine would, in theory, lower the bar to the use of nuclear weapons.
US President Joe Biden had authorized Ukraine to use longer-range American missiles inside Russia on Sunday, ending a months-long prohibition aiming to help Ukraine defend itself while not drastically escalating the conflict.
The decision came at a crucial moment in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia is probing on the frontlines in Ukraine’s east while pummeling its cities with missile and drone strikes, aiming to disable Ukraine’s power grid and weaponize the freezing temperatures for a third consecutive winter.
Meanwhile, thousands of North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops launched a daring counteroffensive in the summer.
In a press briefing Monday, US State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the involvement of North Korean troops in the war was “a major escalation by Russia, bringing in an Asian military to a conflict inside Europe.”
The decision to allow the use of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, inside Russia had been under consideration for months, with American officials divided on the wisdom of allowing the new capability. Some had concerns about escalating the war, while others worried about dwindling stockpiles of the weapons.
Other Western allies remain more cautious. At the G20 summit in Brazil on Tuesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reiterated his stance of withholding Taurus missiles from Ukraine, adding that “supplying cruise missiles would be a mistake.”
Although Kyiv has repeatedly used Ukrainian-made drones to hit targets in Russia – deeper into the country than Bryansk – Moscow has long maintained that using far-reaching Western weapons would constitute a major escalation.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Tuesday that Moscow will view launches of US-made longer-range missiles as a “new phase of war” by the West.
American officials said they were unsurprised by the news of Putin updating Russia’s nuclear doctrine. “Russia had been signaling its intent to update its doctrine for several weeks,” a US official told CNN.
Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said at a briefing that the US doesn’t have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine, adding, “It’s the same irresponsible rhetoric that we’ve seen before and that we’ve seen, frankly, for the past two years.”

In more than two-and-a-half years of war, Russia has often rattled the nuclear saber in response to perceived escalation by Ukraine and its allies.
After French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this year that he would not rule out sending European troops to Ukraine, Putin ordered a tactical nuclear weapons drill in response to what he called “threats” by the West.
For months, Ukraine’s President Zelensky had argued that “long-range capabilities for our army” is a key part of his “Victory Plan” for winning the war.
Responding on Sunday evening to reports of Biden’s green-light, Zelensky said: “Strikes are not carried out with words. Such things are not announced. Missiles will speak for themselves.”

President Vladimir Putin has updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine, two days after his US counterpart Joe Biden granted Ukraine permission to strike targets deep inside Russia with American-made weapons.
Under the updated doctrine, Moscow will consider aggression from any non-nuclear state – but with the participation of a nuclear country – a joint attack on Russia.
The change comes as Russia claims Ukraine fired the US-made ATACMS missiles into the Russian region of Bryansk. The attack, if confirmed, would mark the first such use by Ukraine since Biden gave the green light.
The Russian government had previously signaled that the US approval would be a dangerous escalation of the war in Ukraine, now 1,000 days old.
The Kremlin began this fresh round of nuclear saber-rattling Tuesday, saying the revised military doctrine would in theory lower the bar to first use of nuclear weapons.
In a phone call with reporters, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov noted the changes mean that “the Russian Federation reserves the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of aggression using conventional weapons against it and/or the Republic of Belarus.”

Biden’s green light for Ukraine to use ATACMS in Russia just raised the stakes in a war Trump will inherit
Nuclear deterrence is a pillar of Russian military doctrine, but the revision appears to broaden the definition of what would be considered aggression against Russia.
“An important element of this document is that nuclear deterrence is aimed at ensuring that a potential adversary understands the inevitability of retaliation in the event of aggression against the Russian Federation or its allies,” Peskov said.
The revised doctrine is clearly meant to send a strong signal to Ukraine’s Western backers about the risks of escalation – and make policymakers and the public think twice about the possible consequences of providing more sophisticated and far-reaching weaponry to Ukraine.
But Russia has also escalated its own campaign against Ukraine in recent days, blanketing the country with drone and missile attacks that seem aimed in part at destroying civilian energy infrastructure as winter approaches.

Russia’s doctrinal change follows a consistent pattern of threatening rhetoric that has persisted since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
After French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this year that he would not rule out sending Western troops to Ukraine, Putin ordered a tactical nuclear weapons drill in response to what he called “threats” by the West.
Russia’s warnings around Western deliveries of military aid to Ukraine have become almost a matter of routine since the run-up to the full-scale invasion in February 2022.
The Kremlin has warned about “enormous risks” around the delivery of F-16 fighter jets, “serious consequences” for sending Patriot air-defense systems and has expressed fury over sending Western tanks to Ukraine.
But the revision of the nuclear doctrine appears designed to add a new level of credibility to Russian threats of escalation, particularly as a new administration prepares to take office in Washington.
Shifting red lines
Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion, it has lowered the threshold under which it would consider using nuclear weapons.
In a 2020 update to the nuclear doctrine – before the war began – Putin said Moscow reserves the right to use nuclear weapons “when the very existence of the state is threatened.”
But changes outlined in September this year appeared to lower that threshold, saying Moscow could use nuclear weapons when facing “a critical threat to its sovereignty.”
Tuesday’s decree refines the circumstances in which Russia might resort to nuclear weapons. It essentially restates and makes official the terms set out in September’s proposed revision, which said Moscow would consider any assault on it supported by a nuclear power to be a joint attack. This updates the list of conventional weaponry whose launch might constitute a critical threat, and specifies an attack on Belarus would be viewed on an equal footing to Russia.

Russian officials responded furiously to reports that the Biden administration had lifted its years-long prohibition on Ukraine’s use of ATACMS – American weapons capable of striking targets deep in Russia.
Speaking Monday, Peskov said the move showed Biden wanted to “throw oil on the fire and escalate the conflict in Ukraine.”
However, the incoming administration of US President-elect Donald Trump may complicate the Kremlin’s reaction to Biden’s decision to green-light Ukraine’s use of ATACM missiles.
Trump, who will take office in just over two months, has said he wants to bring the war in Ukraine to a swift end, but has not specified how he will do so.
Although Trump has not yet commented on Biden’s decision, his son, Donald Trump Jr., has criticized it.
“The Military Industrial Complex seems to want to make sure they get World War 3 going before my father has a chance to create peace and save lives,” he said on social media.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/19/europe/putin-russia-update-nuclear-doctrine-ukraine-intl/index.html
234,Ukraine,2024,11,Zelensky accuses German chancellor of opening ‘Pandora’s box’ with Putin,CNN staff,"CNN
 — 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has criticized a call between Germany’s chancellor and Russian President Vladimir Putin as opening a “Pandora’s box” that only works to undermine efforts to isolate Russia’s leader.
“This is exactly what Putin has been wanting for a long time: it is extremely important for him to weaken his isolation, Russia’s isolation, and to have normal negotiations that will not end in anything,” Zelensky said about Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s call.
The conversation on Friday was the first time Scholz had spoken with Putin in two years. It comes as the German leader gears up for a snap election and Europe waits to hear US President-elect Donald Trump’s plan for ending the war in Ukraine.
On the call, Scholz urged Putin to pull his forces out of Ukraine and begin talks with Kyiv that would open the way for a “just and lasting peace,” the German government said, Reuters reported.
The Kremlin said the conversation had come at Berlin’s request, and that Putin had told Scholz any agreement to end the war in Ukraine must take Russian security interests into account and reflect “new territorial realities.”
Zelensky and other European officials had cautioned Scholz against the move, according to sources familiar with the matter, who believed it was more for domestic consumption, Reuters reported.
Facing a snap election on Feb. 23, Scholz’s Social Democrats are coming under pressure from Russia-friendly populist parties on both sides of the political spectrum that argue the government has not deployed enough diplomacy to end the war, according to Reuters.
“The chancellor urged Russia to show willingness to enter talks with Ukraine with the aim of achieving a just and lasting peace,” a German government spokesperson said in a statement, Reuters added.
“He stressed Germany’s unbroken determination to back Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression for as long as necessary,” the spokesperson added, said Reuters.
Ukraine said however that phone conversations with Putin brought no added value on the path to achieving a “just peace” in Ukraine. “This [the call] made it possible for Russia to change nothing in its policy, to do nothing in essence, and this is exactly what led to this war,” Zelensky said in his evening address.
The call comes in the week after Trump was elected as the next US president. He has suggested he could put a swift end to the war, without explaining how, and repeatedly criticized the scale of Western financial and military aid for Kyiv.
“It sends a bad signal especially after Trump’s election,” said one Western diplomat to Reuters, noting their country had told Berlin it was not a good idea. “My hope is that Scholz can now say to his electorate ‘look, I have done it, and it’s a waste of time as Putin isn’t open to anything’. But of course, (it is a) question about how Russia spins it.”
Scholz to brief allies
The Kremlin said Putin had told Scholz Russia was willing to look at energy deals if Germany was interested. Germany was heavily reliant on Russian gas before the war but direct shipments ceased when pipelines under the Baltic Sea were blown up in 2022.
Scholz plans to brief Zelensky, Germany’s allies, partners and the heads of the European Union and NATO on the outcome of Friday’s call, German officials said, according to Reuters. Putin and Scholz agreed to stay in contact, they added.
Ukraine is facing increasingly difficult conditions on the frontlines in its east amid shortages of arms and personnel, while Russian forces make steady advances.
A separate German government official told Reuters that Scholz had told Putin the deployment of North Korean troops to Russia for combat missions against Ukraine was seen as a serious escalation and expansion of the conflict.
Zelensky says North Korea has 11,000 troops in Russia and that some have suffered casualties in combat with Ukrainian forces which are currently occupying territory in Russia’s southern Kursk region.
Germany has given Ukraine a total of 15 billion euros in financial, humanitarian and military support since the start of the full-scale war, making it Kyiv’s second-largest backer after the United States, according to Reuters.
The future of US aid to Ukraine is unclear following Trump’s election victory.
Scholz and Putin last spoke in December 2022, 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, plunging relations with the West into their deepest freeze since the Cold War, Reuters added.

 — 
As US President-elect Donald Trump continues to make heads turn with nominations for key roles in his incoming administration, Russians are trying to understand the appointments and what impacts they might have for Moscow.
Russian state TV has spent the last few days using their slickly produced talk shows to tell the Russian people what they should make of the incoming administration – in particular what it might mean for Russians and the war in Ukraine.
Evgeny Popov, a well-known face on Russian state TV and Duma representative used his show, co-hosted with his wife, to tear into Mike Waltz, Donald Trump’s pick for his national security adviser.
Waltz has previously expressed reservations about continued congressional support for Ukraine, and is a proponent of a peace plan for Ukraine – but has not ruled out applying pressure on Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin to force him to the table. Waltz also described Russia as “a gas station with nukes” in an interview with NPR on November 4.
Popov was quick to point out the potential threat to Moscow, “(Waltz) at the Republican convention proposed deploying more American drones in the Black Sea and bragged about how Trump threatened to bomb, as he put it, ‘Putin’s Kremlin.’ That is what’s called the Russophobic Dream Team or the American dream team.”
RELATED ARTICLE

But across the studio floor, Olga Skabeeva, Popov’s wife, was a little more welcoming of the pick of former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence. Gabbard had been “clear on the reason for Russia’s special operation in Ukraine,” Skabeeva said, praising Gabbard’s criticism of US support for Kyiv.
Meanwhile on the streets in Moscow, people interviewed by CNN were largely not well versed with the incoming administration – except for when it came to Elon Musk, who has been named as the future leader of a new Department of Government Efficiency along with Vivek Ramaswamy.
Tatiyana, wrapped in her matching pink hat and scarf, told CNN that Elon Musk “is an example of the future of the planet. He does a lot to improve our planet, and this is the right development. Therefore, we wish him only prosperity and all the best.”
Elena, who was walking with her daughter, said of Musk: “Everything he’s done is very interesting, and the fact that he has such ideas is also, in principle, good for development in general.”
The tech tycoon’s status as a super-rich maverick who purchased X, formerly Twitter, and who wants to put civilians into space, means he’s more familiar to Russians than nominees for other prominent posts.
Asked about how they viewed the incoming administration and future relations between old adversaries, people were a little more divided.
“Trump said that ‘I will do everything for America’, but he did not say a word about Russia,” Sergey told CNN.
Vladimir Kostyukevich, however, said that Trump makes a good impression as a politician, citing his age and apparent energy – a barb perhaps at outgoing President Joe Biden.

On the thorny issue of Ukraine, invaded at Putin’s orders in February 2022, however, those who spoke to CNN expressed a desire for the war to come to an end, but many were not clear how Trump might be able to do it.
Elena said, “I don’t know how Donald Trump can resolve this. But I would really like this to be resolved as soon as possible and resolved in the most peaceful way possible, through negotiations, and not through the actions that are happening now.”
Tatiyana meanwhile hoped for peace and spoke warmly of Ukraine, a reminder of the bonds that tie the two nations together.
“It’s a good question. Ukraine is our brotherly nation. It has always been so. And despite the fact that relations are so complicated now, we still love Ukraine as before, they are our brothers, our relatives,” she said.
And Kostyukevich hoped for even more. “I don’t know if Trump will stick to his line. But I hope, that there will be a good agreement between Russia and Ukraine.

236,Ukraine,2024,11,"North Korea to mass produce self-detonating explosive drones, state media reports",Helen Regan,"CNN
 — 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has ordered his country to quickly start mass producing self-detonating explosive drones, calling their development an “essential requirement,” after overseeing a test of the deadly aerial weapon, state media reported Friday.
Images published by North Korean state media show Kim and various officials at the launch site. Images show a car and a tank being destroyed by what appears to be unmanned aerial vehicles, which have been heavily blurred by the news agency.
State media reported that drones “of various types precisely hit the targets” as part of the test. They can be “used within different striking ranges” and are designed “to precisely attack any enemy targets on the ground and in the sea,” it said.
Kim said the use of such drones in military activities is being expanded around the world and authorities are recognizing that “drones are achieving clear successes in big and small conflicts,” state media reported.
Such self-detonating drones, also sometimes referred to as suicide drones, have been widely used to great effect on the battlefield in Russia’s war in Ukraine and in the Middle East.
Comparatively cheap to produce and usually deployed in swarms making their numbers difficult to shoot down, drones such as the Iranian-made Shahed 136 have transformed modern combat, providing an asymmetric advantage when deployed against technically superior adversaries.
Kim “underscored the need to build a serial production system as early as possible and go into full-scale mass production,” state media reported, adding that “such objective change urgently calls for updating many parts of military theory.”
The order comes as concern in the West grows over North Korea’s military cooperation with Russia.
The US State Department said Tuesday that 10,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to Russia and “have begun engaging in combat operations with Russian forces” in Kursk region, where Ukraine’s three-month military incursion into Russian territory has stalled.

A Ukrainian commander previously told CNN North Korean troops were a “significant resource” for Moscow’s war on Ukraine, as even those being deployed defensively would free up Russian troops for assault operations elsewhere and would eventually be used in direct combat.
The North Korean troops dispatched to Russia are deemed to have not had suitable training for drone warfare, according to a South Korea’s Defense Intellectual Agency evaluation shared by lawmakers briefed on the issue.
South Korea’s defense minister last month expressed concern that Pyongyang is “very likely to ask” Moscow for advanced technology related to nuclear weapons in exchange for deploying troops to Ukraine.
Thursday’s drone test came after North Korea on Tuesday ratified a mutual defense treaty with Russia in which the two countries pledged to use all available means to provide immediate military assistance in the event the other is attacked.
The move cements the two countries’ deepening alignment in the face of their international isolation over Russia’s war in Ukraine and Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile program.
The defense pact was signed in June by Kim and Vladimir Putin during a rare state visit by the Russian leader to Pyongyang.
Kim previously oversaw the test of self-detonating drones in August, where he stressed the need to equip the North Korean army with them “as early as possible.”
In October, North Korea threatened “retaliation” after accusing South Korea of flying propaganda-filled drones over Pyongyang. Seoul did not confirm or deny the accusations after North Korea’s state-run KCNA published images of what it claimed was a drone, as well as leaflets that said, “a comparison of the food you can buy,” and “North Korea’s economic situation falling into hell.”
In 2022, North Korea sent five drones into South Korea, four of which flew around Ganghwa island and another that flew over capital Seoul’s northern airspace.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/15/asia/north-korea-self-detonating-drones-intl-hnk/index.html

 — 
It took more than a day for rescuers to find Ulyana Kulyk’s tiny body in the rubble.
She was just two months old when a Russian missile hit her home in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Monday morning. Her father was the sole survivor.
Ukrainian officials said it was one of several strikes targeting southern and central cities that morning and the latest in a string of nearly weekly strikes against residential buildings in Kryvyi Rih, many of them deadly.
The city lies some 70 kilometers (40 miles) from the southern Ukrainian front line.
The UN children’s agency UNICEF said that tragic stories like the one of Ulyana and her family “have become the norm in Ukraine as attacks on populated areas continue.”
“In the first 12 days of November, intense and sustained attacks have killed at least four children and injured more than twenty,” the organization said.

Photographs and videos from the scene give a glimpse of the incredible force with which the ballistic missile struck their apartment block. The five-story building looks as if it was sliced in half, with a huge chunk of it missing in the middle.
Ulyana’s mother Olena, 32, and brothers Kyrylo, 10, and Demyd, 2, were all killed. Her father Maksym likely only survived because he was in the kitchen cooking the family breakfast when the building was struck, according to local media.
“I don’t want to live. And today I was supposed to be here with you, the fifth,” Maksym Kulyk said at his children’s and wife’s joint funeral on Thursday.
The funeral was a heart-wrenching affair. Four coffins of the same design and varying sizes, showered with flowers and toys, as dozens of family and friends, including many children, came to say goodbye to the family.
As Kulyk spoke, addressing each of his children and his wife, another air raid siren sounded in the city – as if those attending the funeral needed a reminder that the conflict was still raging.
Olena was an employee of Steel Service, a subsidiary of global giant ArcelorMittal, and was on maternity leave at the time of the attack.
“My soul, my blood, my heart, my support and strength, my rear. I love you so much. I will always love you,” Kulyk said about her.
Kyrylo, the oldest of the three children, was described by his father as his “best friend” and by staff at his school as “a bright light for everyone who knew him.”

“He was only 10 years old, but his short life was full of joy, dreams and boundless love. His smile, carefree laugh and inexhaustible energy brought joy not only to his family, but also to his friends, classmates, teachers and everyone around him,” the 103rd School in Kryvyi Rih said in a statement on Facebook. It said the fourth grader loved reading books, exploring the world and playing football.
“Demyd. I bathed you, slept with you, fed you, went for walks with you. You always said ‘daddy’,” Kulyk said, adding that he was looking forward to Ulyana becoming a “daddy’s girl.”
Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine’s ombudsman, pointed out that all of the children had been born since the conflict with Russia started in eastern Ukraine in 2014.
“A two-month-old girl and boys aged two and 10. These children were born during the war. The 10-year-old boy was born when Russia started its armed aggression against Ukraine. The two-year-old was born when Russia launched a full-scale invasion. The girl was born only recently,” he said in a statement.
The local authorities in Kryvyi Rih declared Wednesday an official day of mourning.
The city has seen a number of ballistic missile strikes in recent weeks. Two, each killing two people and injuring more than a dozen, struck Kryvyi Rih within one week earlier this month. In September, at least 10 people, including a 12-year-old child, were killed in three separate missile strikes.
900 bombs in one week
The frequent waves of aerial attacks come as Ukraine struggles to repel Russian advances in eastern Ukraine. At the same time, Russia appears to be preparing for a counteroffensive in its southern Kursk region, deploying tens of thousands troops into the area, according to Ukrainian and US officials.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday that in just one week, Russia dropped more than 900 bombs and launched some 30 missiles and nearly 500 drones across Ukraine. He said that most of the strikes were directed against civilian objects and critical infrastructure.
Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska are from Kryvyi Rih, a city that lies some 70 kilometers (40 miles) from the southern Ukrainian front line.
When the news of the three children killed in the city emerged on Tuesday, Zelenska paid tribute to the victims and made yet another emotional plea to Ukraine’s allies.

“Our only dream is that such a tragedy will never happen again. But the murders cannot be stopped by words. I want everyone who can help us stop the enemy and the grief (the enemy) brings to Ukraine to hear me. Please don’t look for reasons to postpone your help until later. Children must live,” she said in a post on her Telegram channel.
Ukraine marked 1,000 days since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 on Tuesday, with many inside the country and elsewhere worried about the impact of former President Donald Trump’s second term in office on the conflict. Trump has previously said he would end the conflict “in 24 hours,” without revealing any details as to how.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/europe/ukrainian-mother-killed-russian-strike-zelensky-hometown-intl/index.html
238,Ukraine,2024,11,Senior commanders react to Trump’s new cabinet picks,Jim Sciutto,"CNN
 — 
Within minutes of President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement of Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his selection for secretary of Defense, current and former senior military commanders began messaging and calling me with their reactions. “Ridiculous,” said one. “An effing (euphemism inserted) nightmare,” said another. To be clear, these were not partisans, but senior commanders who have served under both Presidents Trump and Joe Biden.
Their critiques, as they continued, were not personal. None had anything negative to say about Hegseth. Their central concern is that they see Trump, with this and other senior national security appointments, building out a team to put into action massive and lasting changes to US foreign policy.
“There’s no serious experience in the business of running the Pentagon or the national security staff processes, but I’m trying to retain an open mind and hope that fresh ideas could improve things that get pretty stale,” a retired four-star general told me. “That said, the common denominator is clearly loyalty and while some loyalty is essential, slavish fealty is dangerous. Looking at all the announcements to date, we could end up with one mind controlling many hands. And I’ve never believed that one mind, any mind, does that as well as diversity of thought.”
The 2024 election - unlike previous ones with differences at the margins - may prove to have an enormous impact not just on US foreign policy but on America’s role in the world. Trump has repeatedly expressed that he’s ready to deliver on his “America First” agenda, ending US entanglements abroad and diminishing or altering treaty relationships he sees as skewed against American interests, each a departure from what used to be a bipartisan worldview. To that point, Hegseth has from his perch at Fox News long been a vocal, public proponent of Trump’s “America First” agenda.

Trump, as in domestic politics, has demonstrated a transactional view of US relations abroad - and one that often fails to differentiate based on values or shared history. He’s repeatedly communicated that he sees the US as no better or worse than its adversaries. There is a common thread between Trump’s answer to Bill O’Reilly in 2017 when the then-Fox News host reminded him, “Putin is a killer”, to which Trump answered, “You think we’re so innocent?” and his comment at a rally in Michigan during the last week of the 2024 campaign that “In many cases, our allies are worse than our so-called enemies.”
With this view of America’s relationships with allies and adversaries, Trump seems to believe that as president he will be just as able to make mutually beneficial agreements for the US with, say, Russia or China, as with US allies in Europe and Asia – that is, with nations that have fought alongside the US and signed mutual defense treaties.
Negotiations with Moscow or Beijing are certainly better than a super-power war, but this approach neglects that those adversaries see it as in their strategic interests to weaken the US and the US-led global order – objectives made clearer as Russia and China increasingly join forces with North Korea and Iran across the globe, from the battlefields of Ukraine to the sharing of nuclear and missile technology, to new agreements such as the mutual defense treaty signed recently between Pyongyang and Moscow.
Can Trump make a great deal that would push China and Russia, and North Korea and Iran, to abandon or temper those strategic interests? Theoretically, I suppose that’s possible, though former British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston – who famously said only interests, not allies, are “eternal and perpetual” – would beg to differ.

‘If I were Ukraine, I’d be very worried’
So what would this mean for US foreign policy in the near term? Trump’s former senior advisers told me in my recent book, “The Return of Great Powers” that, with this established worldview, Trump would end aid to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia.
“If I were Ukraine, I’d be very worried,” Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton told me, “because if everything is a deal, then what’s another 10% of Ukrainian territory if it brings peace, kind of thing?”

They told me Taiwan should be similarly concerned. While Biden vowed publicly multiple times to defend Taiwan militarily against a Chinese invasion – ending a decades-old US policy of strategic ambiguity toward the self-governing island – none of Trump’s former senior advisers told me they believe Trump would do the same.
US defense treaties are similarly on the table. Several of his advisers said he might attempt to exit NATO (as they witnessed him attempt to do briefly in his first term) or, if thwarted by new legislation passed by Congress making such a unilateral withdrawal harder, signal that he, as commander in chief, would not abide by NATO’s Article 5 committing members to defend other members militarily. In their view, his line in February that Russia could “do whatever the hell they want” to NATO countries that don’t pay up was meaningful.
“I think NATO would be in real jeopardy,” Bolton told me before the election. “I think he would try to get out.”
This raises questions about Trump’s commitment to other alliances around the world, including those in Asia with South Korea and Japan. During his first term, Trump suspended large-scale military exercises with South Korea as a gesture to North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, war games that Seoul views as crucial to its military readiness. In October, Trump put a price tag on the continued US deployment on the Korean peninsula: $10 billion.
A new nuclear arms race?
Military commanders and diplomats in Europe and Asia tell me they fear a particularly dangerous byproduct of Trump’s potential withdrawal from US commitments abroad: Fearing for their own security, nations in Asia and Europe may decide to develop nuclear weapons to replace the security of the US nuclear umbrella.
Such a move would in turn lead US adversaries Russia and China (and North Korea and, potentially, Iran if it were to build a bomb) to expand their own arsenals to maintain deterrence. Other countries in each region – from Saudi Arabia to Egypt to India, to name a few – might reasonably do the same. And, so, Trump, who has often expressed his deep and rightful fear of nuclear war, might inadvertently spark a new nuclear arms race.

Does this matter to Americans at home? The costs of America’s long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have understandably whittled away public support for military interventions abroad. And the price tag of US military assistance to Ukraine – while a fraction of the US defense budget overall – has been seen as politically untenable to many during an affordability crisis at home.
However, Americans would have to be willing to make accommodations to the ambitions of the world’s new and increasingly powerful alliance of autocrats. That would come with costs. National security veterans emphasize that the US-led international order, as dry as the name sounds, provides benefits to Americans they may not realize: respect for the borders of sovereign nations, a legacy of the carnage wrought by World War II and now so deeply challenged by the Russian invasion of Ukraine; free shipping lanes in Asia and Europe; rule of law to enable business deals and international markets for US goods; global air travel; international study abroad programs; relatively cheap imports; mobile phones that work around the world, to name just a few examples. They are things that would fade in a dog-eat-dog world.
“This rule set…is one of the fundamental contributing factors to not having a breakout of a great power war,” former Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley told me. “It’s not the only reason, but it’s one of the fundamental reasons why there hasn’t been a great power war in eight decades. So if that rule set goes away … then you’ll be doubling your defense budgets because the world will return to Hobbesian nature where it’s going to be only the strong survive and it’s going to be a dog eat-dog-world. And there won’t be any rules.”
The art of the deal
What used to be the bipartisan approach has proven far from perfect. The US and its allies have not figured out how to win in Ukraine and likely have quietly pushed for some territorial concessions to end the war and pulled back from a commitment for Ukraine to join NATO
“In order to have a successful negotiation, you have to somehow address both sets of national security insecurities or anxieties. So, you have to somehow convince the Russians that NATO is not going to invade, Ukraine is not going to be part of NATO, and that they shouldn’t fear invasion from the West, that sort of thing,” Milley told me.
What was something of a dirty little secret under Biden – Ukraine may have to cede both territory and compromise on security assurances – is now public as the Trump administration takes shape.
US allies will now have to adjust, and many European diplomats told me they were already making preparations to do so before the election. At a minimum, they expect US leadership in Europe to fade, necessitating a more urgent move toward larger military expenditures and a broad military expansion.
In Asia, US treaties with South Korea, Japan and Australia may no longer be the same counterweight to China. Both Trump and Democratic rival Kamala Harris would have sought some diplomatic contact with Moscow and Beijing, but Harris would have done so on the basis of the US’ current alliance structure. For Trump, it seems, everything is on the table. It doesn’t mean he’ll definitely make deals. He walked away from Kim Jong Un during his first term when the North Korean leader didn’t give enough ground on his nuclear weapons program. But, again, everything, it appears, is negotiable.
I often remind audiences when I discuss my book that we, as a nation, are still congratulating ourselves for standing up to despots during World War II, with a new movie and streaming series seemingly every year. For the past eight decades or so, that view hasn’t just been emotional. By and large, and with exceptions certainly, it has been established US policy, in part as an expression of US values but also as central to the pursuit of US strategic interests. This election presented the country with a choice as to whether it wants to stay that course or take a new direction.
Again, the status quo is full of dangers. The direction of competition among the great powers was already frightening. However, current and former US commanders and the leaders of America’s closest allies believe the “America First” approach has its own dangers. It is not, in fact, a new approach. Today’s rhetoric mimics the country’s isolationists pre-World War II. America decided then that retreating behind the ramparts of the home front was impossible.
One final note: With the new technologies of today, from expanding nuclear arsenals to cyberattacks to space weapons to drones to AI, and global challenges such as climate change and refugee flows, ignoring the world beyond America’s shores is even less possible than it was in 1939. President-elect Trump’s early personnel moves demonstrate he is ready to test that assumption.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/trump-shake-up-foreign-policy-order/index.html
239,Ukraine,2024,11,"Elise Stefanik, Trump’s pick for UN ambassador, declines to stand by previous support for Ukraine joining NATO",Andrew Kaczynski,"CNN
 — 
New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, is now refusing to stand by her previous push for Ukraine’s NATO membership — a stance she once framed as critical to regional stability.
Her office also declined to say whether she still believes Russia committed genocide in Ukraine, as she said in 2022.
In 2022, Stefanik urged NATO to admit the nation, especially as Russia’s invasion escalated. At the time, she argued for extensive military aid support, highlighting the Trump administration’s previous providing of Javelin missiles.
“I’ve seen how important Ukraine is for the region,” she said. “They need to be admitted into NATO and we need to do everything we can by providing them munitions and javelins, and remember, the javelins were supplied under the Trump administration.”
Her comments at the time reflected the strong pro-Ukraine stance that aligned with broad bipartisan support for Kyiv in the early days of the conflict.
Now, when asked if she still supports NATO membership for Ukraine, Stefanik’s spokesperson declined to specifically address her current position. Instead, her office signaled that she is aligning with Trump’s approach.
“Chairwoman Stefanik fully supports President Trump’s peace through strength policy agenda and will follow his lead as Commander in Chief on best practices to end the war in Ukraine,” her communications director, Ali Black, told CNN.
Stefanik’s non-answer on Ukraine’s possible NATO membership comes as public opinion on providing aid has shifted away from the early US support for Ukraine, with Trump and other Republicans voicing increasing skepticism about the role of American military and financial aid in the prolonged conflict that has gone on for more than two and a half years.
Stefanik’s actions in the House also have shifted with public opinion. She initially championed pro-Ukraine legislation and supported numerous sanctions against Russia along with multiple rounds of military aid for Ukraine. But in April, she voted against a $60 billion Ukraine aid package, citing concerns over the spending and saying it was better to prioritize the crisis at the southern border.
That stands at contrast with comments she made in April 2022, when she touted that she was among nearly 400 members of the US House of Representatives sanctioned by Russia, calling it a “badge of honor.” She described Russia’s actions as “genocide” against the Ukrainian people and labeled Russian President Vladimir Putin a “thug” and “war criminal.”

240,Isreal,2024,11,"Israel issues more than 1,000 arrest warrants for ultra-Orthodox draft avoiders",,"Israel’s military has issued 1,126 arrest warrants for ultra-Orthodox conscripts who have not responded to drafting orders, in a move likely to fuel discontent over a controversial decision to remove their decades-long exemption from service.
Brig. Gen. Shay Tayeb announced the arrest warrants to a parliamentary committee Tuesday, saying that conscripts who had ignored their orders would initially be called and reminded of their duty.
Those who continued not to cooperate, he said, would be summoned immediately or risk being declared a draft dodger – after which they would be banned from foreign travel and risk arrest if stopped by police.
The move is likely to fuel the discontent that has roiled the country since a Supreme Court ruling in June that ultra-Orthodox Jews could not be exempt from military service, as they have been since the founding of Israel.
Israel has turned to enlisting ultra-Orthodox (or Haredi) Jews of draft age after more than a year of war in Gaza and a ground operation in Lebanon that has strained its military, but the move has been deeply unpopular with a community on whose support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu relies for his governing coalition.

Since the Supreme Court ruling, Israeli authorities have sent out 3,000 draft orders to ultra-Orthodox Jews and new Defense Minister Israel Katz said last week he would send out an additional 7,000 orders that were approved by his predecessor Yoav Gallant before he was fired two weeks ago.
However, in his comments Tuesday, Brig. Gen. Tayib cautioned that even 10,000 ultra-Orthodox conscripts might not be enough.
“The IDF is in need of soldiers. We touched on the figure of 10,000, but this isn’t a stable figure because we have casualties unfortunately,” he said.
On Tuesday, Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid called on Katz to “act immediately” to issue the additional draft orders and to “expand the enforcement towards those who didn’t show up.”
“This is a test revealing who stands with the combat troops and who stands with the draft dodgers,” he posted on X.
‘Death rather than draft’
Anger had been simmering among the ultra-Orthodox community even before the news of the arrest warrants.
On Sunday, scuffles broke out between police and ultra-Orthodox protesters in Bnei Brak, east of Tel Aviv. Reuters footage shows protesters holding signs reading: “It is better to die a religious Jew than to live as a secular Jew” and “Death rather than draft.”
“Our youth are demonstrating because the Israeli government wants to (recruit) our religious people to the army,” said protester Yona Kaye.
“Our history is full of Jews who have given up their lives in order to remain religious,” Kaye added. “We will die. We will stay extended periods of time in jail but not go to the Israeli army, which means to become irreligious.”

241,Isreal,2024,11,"Nearly a hundred aid trucks looted in Gaza, as UN warns of ‘collapse of law and order’",Pauline Lockwood,"CNN
 — 
Nearly one hundred aid trucks were looted in southern Gaza on Saturday in what UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has described as “one of the worst” incidents of its kind.
Of the 109 trucks carrying food supplies for UNRWA and the World Food Programme from the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza, 97 trucks were “lost” in the looting, UNRWA told CNN in a statement Monday.
Drivers were forced to unload trucks at gun point, aid workers were injured, and vehicles were damaged extensively, it said.
The Israeli military reportedly told the convoy, initially scheduled for Sunday, to “depart at short notice via an alternate, unfamiliar route (on Saturday),” according to UNRWA.
The UN agency did not identify the perpetrators of the looting, but blamed the “collapse of law and order” and the “approach of the Israeli authorities” for creating a “perilous environment.”
It said the challenges involved in delivering aid to Gaza had become “increasingly insurmountable,” with “trucks frequently delayed at various holding points, often looted, and subjected to escalating attacks.”
“Well, we have been warning for a long time about the total breakdown of civil order; (until) four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoys. This has completely gone,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini told a press conference in Geneva on Monday.
CNN has reached out to Israeli authorities on the matter but has not yet heard back.
A spokesperson for the US State Department called the looting “abhorrent” and blamed it on the “overall breakdown” of security in Gaza, for which he said the the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was partly to blame.
“They’re working to establish an improved security situation on the ground, but clearly, when you have looting going on, there’s a breakdown,” State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at told a press briefing on Tuesday. “And the IDF certainly bears part of the blame for that.”
In a report Monday that cited Gaza’s interior ministry, the Hamas-run Al-Aqsa TV channel claimed Gaza security forces had killed more than 20 people involved in looting aid trucks, though it did not specifically mention Saturday’s incident.
The National and Islamic Forces, a coalition of Palestinian groups, commended the ministry’s actions against the looters, who it referred to as “criminal thieves who disrupt the security of our internal front and steal the livelihoods, bread, and medicine of our citizens.”
Worsening shortages
The attack on the convoy – the worst of its kind “in terms of volume,” according to UN Secretary-General Stéphane Dujarric – comes amid warnings by the UN that already severe shortages of food and aid in Gaza will worsen without immediate intervention.
Civilians fleeing northern Gaza after weeks of intense Israeli military operations have told of a chronic lack of food and people dying of hunger, while aid agencies have warned that the area is on the brink of famine.
On Thursday, a UN Special Committee report alleged Israel was using starvation as a method of war – an allegation denied by COGAT, the Israeli agency that approves aid shipments into Gaza.
Israel insists however that the number of aid trucks entering Gaza has risen and that it is “working tirelessly” to get aid into the enclave. The US State Department last week assessed it was not blocking aid – though it said improvements were needed.
At his press conference Tuesday, US State Department Miller said the US was working with the IDF, COGAT and UN agencies to get more assistance to those who need it. He noted the opening of new aid routes to Gaza, which happened after the Israeli government allowed only limited access to the besieged strip for weeks. He said the US hoped some of the new routes would help divert convoys away from looters.

The attack on the convoy also comes amid a backdrop of deteriorating relations between Israel and UNRWA. The agency’s ability to deliver aid to Gaza took a hit last month when Israel’s parliament voted to ban it, in a move that is expected to severely restrict its operations in territories Israel occupies, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The new law requires all contact between Israeli officials and the UN agency to cease by the end of January.
Israel claims UNRWA has forced it to act, alleging that some of its employees are affiliated with Hamas and that its schools teach hate against Israel. UNRWA has repeatedly denied these accusations.
At the press conference in Geneva, Lazzarini spoke of the UN’s concerns over the new law, warning there was no other agency that could replace UNRWA’s role in helping the Palestinians.
“Our staff in the region is deeply, deeply concerned, anxious, worried about what might happen,” he said.
Lazzarini also told the conference of an incident last week in which he said a female UNRWA worker had been searched at her home by IDF soldiers.
“When they realized that she is working for UNRWA, basically, they told her, ‘How come you work for a terrorist organization?’” Lazzarini said, adding that the soldiers asked her for access to all the data in her computer, brought her in for interrogation for a few hours, and handcuffed her to a post. CNN has reached out to the IDF about the incident.
Heavy toll on civilians
Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in Gaza continue to take a heavy toll on civilians.
On Monday, Israeli airstrikes killed at least 50 people, including 17 members of a single family, according to the local health ministry.
Most of the dead were killed in on northern Gaza, including the 17 family members who died in the city of Beit Lahiya, the ministry’s general director Dr. Munir Al-Bursh told CNN.
He said the 17 were family members of Hani Badran, a cardiologist who was working at the city’s Kamal Adwan hospital at the time of the strike that killed them.
A local journalist who spoke to the cardiologist told CNN that Badran’s children had been killed alongside his sister, her husband and their children. Among the killed children was his sister’s weeks-old newborn, who Badran had delivered and whose birth he had intended to register on Monday, he said.

“This scene is now being repeated almost constantly. Very violent targeting, with shells from tanks,” Safiya said.
He said patients were filled with “fear and horror,” adding “we are now pleading to the world. This killing machine must be stopped, the bombing must be stopped.”

242,Isreal,2024,11,US envoy heads to Beirut as Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire talks gain momentum,Tamara Qiblawi,"CNN
 — 
United States envoy Amos Hochstein is expected in Beirut on Tuesday, according to two Lebanese official sources, in what is seen as a sign of progress in ceasefire negotiations for the deadly cross-border conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The news comes after Beirut responded “positively” to a US-backed proposal to stop the Israel-Hezbollah war, per Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Makati. Speaking to Al Araby TV news channel on Monday, Makati said the Lebanese government had been seeking clarification on some “unclear points” in the ceasefire proposal, but that large parts of the draft agreement were resolved.
Certain points would “clarification” through a “face to face” discussions with Hochstein, he added.

Lebanon ceasefire talks intensify as Hezbollah considers new US-Israeli proposal
US ambassador to Lebanon Lisa Johnson relayed the proposal to the Lebanese government via Nabih Berri, the parliament speaker, on Thursday night, a Lebanese official told CNN earlier.
According to the official, Hezbollah reviewed the proposal and submitted their response to Lebanese authorities on Sunday evening. The source described the response as largely “positive.”
A source familiar with the situation told CNN that the negotiations on a diplomatic resolution are continuing and noted that Hochstein’s trip does not necessarily signal that a deal is imminent.
What’s in the ceasefire proposal
The US-backed proposal aims to achieve a 60-day cessation of hostilities and is being portrayed as the basis of a lasting ceasefire, according to the Lebanese official, adding that terms lie within the parameters of UN Resolution 1701 which ended the Lebanon-Israel war of 2006. The resolution stipulates that the only armed groups in the area south of Lebanon’s Litani River should be the Lebanese army and UN peacekeeping forces.
The proposal also requires Israeli ground forces, operating in southern Lebanon since late September, to withdraw from the country and demands a stricter enforcement of resolution 1701, according to the Lebanese official.
Both Israel and Lebanon have “reacted” to the proposal, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Monday.
“We have been sharing proposals, both with the Government of Lebanon and the Government of Israel. Both sides have reacted to the proposals that we have put forward,” he said at a press briefing.
Miller would not say if the US is optimistic about the prospects of reaching an agreement, but noted that “when you have a resolution in the interest of all the relevant parties, we ought to be able to get to an agreement, and that’s what we’re going to try to do.”
“We’re going to continue to stay at that process, because we believe a diplomatic resolution is key to allowing the fighting to stop, to protecting civilians and allowing the civilians in both Israel and Lebanon to return to their homes,” said Miller.

Israeli ‘operational freedom’
An Israeli source familiar with the talks however cast doubt on the likelihood of an imminent deal, noting that while progress has been made, Hezbollah’s refusal to accept Israel’s demand for the right to strike Hezbollah targets in the event of a ceasefire violation could jeopardize the process. Without this clause, the source added, it is uncertain whether Netanyahu can secure cabinet approval for the agreement.
The Israeli source added that Hochstein has not yet confirmed when he will arrive in the region.
Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right Israeli minister of finance, said on Monday that “full operational freedom” for the Israeli military in southern Lebanon is “a non-negotiable condition.”
“At the end of the war, we will have operational freedom in Gaza, and so we will also have operational freedom in Lebanon. We will not agree to any arrangement that is not worth the paper it is written on,” he said. “We are changing the security paradigm and will not return to decades of concepts of containment and threats without response. This will not happen again.”
In his interview with Al Araby TV, Mikati dismissed reports of demands to give the Israeli military operational freedom in south Lebanon as “speculation,” adding that he hasn’t seen such a clause in the proposal.

Berri, who leads the Hezbollah-allied Amal party and is an interlocutor in the talks, told Saudi-owned Asharq Al Awsat newspaper on Friday that the proposal he received from the US does not include mention of Israeli military operational freedom in Lebanon, adding that the US knows that such a demand would be “unacceptable.”
The Lebanese official who spoke to CNN also said the proposal does not refer to Israel’s right to continue striking Lebanon after a truce.
The source also said Hezbollah has agreed to separate its conflict with Israel from Israel’s war in Gaza. Prior to Israel’s all-out offensive in late September, the militant group had insisted it would only cease near-daily attacks on Israel’s northern-most territories once a ceasefire was achieved in Gaza.
According to multiple high-level Lebanese officials, Hezbollah had initially agreed to delink the two conflicts the night before its leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in late September.
Mikati said that his government is in contact with US President-elect Donald Trump’s team.
Another Lebanese source familiar with the ceasefire talks told CNN earlier that President-elect Trump has endorsed Hochstein’s ceasefire negotiations track, increasing the chances of its success.
Israel is ‘ready to do’ a deal
Meanwhile, a senior US official told CNN that there is “no stock” in reports that Israel will try to delay a deal. “The Israelis have confirmed to us they’re ready to do it,” the source said.
A deal with Hezbollah would “send a signal to Hamas” that Israel and its partners will do their utmost to secure a deal that brings back hostages held in Gaza, the US official said.

“If we have a Lebanon deal, we’re going to come down like a ton of bricks on Hamas to try to get a hostage deal,” the official said, adding that Israel needs “to turn this military success… into a strategic success.”
The US official said that the region was in a deadlock as Hamas refused to strike a ceasefire deal that returns Israeli hostages, and Hezbollah had vowed to keep fighting until Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza came to an end.
While the US is not privy to all of Israel’s military plans, the official said, “having the degradation of Hezbollah helps” to strike an agreement.
“To get a deal in Lebanon, Hezbollah has to be put under pressure,” the US official said, adding that “Hezbollah cannot rebuild its massive military infrastructure” across the border with Israel.

 — 
Pope Francis has said that allegations of a genocide in Gaza should be “carefully investigated” marking some of his strongest criticism yet of Israel’s war with Hamas.
“According to some experts… what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide,” Vatican News, the Holy See’s official news outlet, cited the pontiff as writing in a forthcoming book. “It should be carefully investigated to determine whether it fits into the technical definition formulated by jurists and international bodies.”

Israel’s war conduct in Gaza ‘consistent with the characteristics of genocide,’ UN Special Committee finds
Speaking of refugees, the pope said: “I am thinking above all of those who leave Gaza in the midst of the famine that has struck their Palestinian brothers and sisters given the difficulty of getting food and aid into their territory,” according to Vatican News.
With few exceptions, most Gazans have been prevented from leaving the territory since the war began, but almost the entire population of more than 2 million has been internally displaced.
The excerpts are from the book “Hope never disappoints: Pilgrims towards a better world,” which is due to be released on November 19.
Responding to the report in Vatican News, Yaron Sideman, Israeli ambassador to the Holy See, said “there was a genocidal massacre on 7 October 2023 of Israeli citizens,” referring to the Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw another 250 taken hostage.
“Since then, Israel has exercised its right of self-defense against attempts from seven different fronts to kill its citizens,” Sideman wrote on X. “Any attempt to call it by any other name is singling out the Jewish state.”
The 87-year-old pontiff is the latest among a growing number of international figures and organizations to refer to Israel’s military operation in Gaza as a potential genocide.
Israel is facing a case brought by South Africa at the United Nations’ International Court of Justice (ICJ) in which Pretoria accuses the Jewish state of genocide, saying Israeli leadership is “intent on destroying the Palestinians in Gaza.”

Israel earlier this year rejected what it called the “grossly distorted” accusation of genocide leveled against it by South Africa, arguing at the ICJ that its war is being fought in self-defense against Hamas, and that it was targeting the militant group rather than Palestinians as a whole.
A UN Special Committee report released Thursday said Israel’s war conduct in Gaza “is consistent with the characteristics of genocide,” including mass civilian casualties and using starvation as a weapon.

Pope Francis rarely comments on politics, often limiting his remarks to calls for peace. In March, he repeated his call for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in his traditional Easter message at the Vatican, condemning war as an “absurdity.”
He pleaded for an “immediate ceasefire,” access to humanitarian aid in Gaza and the “prompt release of the hostages.”

244,Isreal,2024,11,Israeli strike kills Hezbollah spokesperson as group prepares response to fresh ceasefire proposal,Tamara Qiblawi,"CNN
 — 
The spokesperson of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, Mohammed Afif, was killed in an Israeli strike on Beirut on Sunday.
The death of Afif, who was for years an adviser to the late Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and had been responsible for the group’s media relations since 2014, was confirmed by the militant group in a statement calling him a “great media leader.”
Afif was at the headquarters of the pro-Hezbollah Baath Party at the time of the strike.
No evacuation warning was issued before the strike, which hit an area known as Ras al-Nabaa in the middle of the day, killing four people, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it carried out a “precise, intelligence-based strike” that “eliminated the terrorist Mohammed Afif, the chief propagandist and spokesperson of the Hezbollah terrorist organization.”
Among those paying tribute to Afif was the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which sent its condolences to Afif’s family and Hezbollah leadership, calling him “a strong and defiant voice of resistance.”
On Sunday evening, another strike hit a building in Mar Elias, a densely populated Sunni-majority neighborhood near central Beirut, killing at least two people according to the Lebanese health ministry. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on the strike.
With Sunday’s attacks, five strikes have hit inside Beirut’s city limits since 2006, when a 34-day armed conflict between Israel and Hezbollah took place.
Afif was one of the few public faces of Hezbollah, following a massive Israeli infiltration operation drove the group deep underground.
He often delivered speeches from news conferences amid the rubble in the southern suburbs of Beirut, which have been pounded by attacks since Israel began a new offensive on October 1.
Hezbollah is currently reviewing a US-Israeli ceasefire proposal submitted to the Lebanese government on Thursday, according to CNN sources familiar with the negotiations. It is unclear whether Afif’s reported killing will impact the negotiations.
Israel’s targeting of Afif comes amid an escalation in its offensive in Lebanon. Last week, Israel’s defense minister Israel Katz announced the expansion of the ground operation in southern Lebanon.
And on Sunday Israel said it was using artillery batteries inside Lebanese territory for the first time. Previously, batteries had remained on Israeli soil firing into villages across the border.
Artillery batteries are carrying out shelling from inside Lebanese territory “attacking targets in support of ground forces during their operations,” Avichay Adraee, the Israeli military’s Arabic spokesperson, said Sunday. The aim, Adraee said, is to “expand the scope of the shelling” and “direct heavy fire towards” combat areas in support of ground maneuvers.
Israel’s war on many fronts
In northern Gaza, at least 50 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Beit Lahiya on Sunday morning, according to the enclave’s health ministry.
Dozens of Palestinians displaced by the ongoing Israeli operation in the nearby Jabalya area were sheltering in two of the houses hit, a local journalist said.
“We were sitting at home and suddenly we heard intense strikes, because of this we were not able to leave the house,” one eyewitness, who is also a resident of the area, told CNN without giving his name.
The resident said the people in the area started removing the dead from the rubble in the absence of civil defense and ambulances. Gaza’s civil defense say they are unable to operate in the area due to the continuing Israeli strikes.

“These were people displaced from Jabalya to Beit Lahiya,” the eyewitness said.
A video of the aftermath seen by CNN shows children panicking, with some crying in the background, as a man tells them to calm down and get out. A toddler, covered in blood, is being held in someone’s arms.
Another toddler is heard in the background crying, “mama, mama.”
The IDF told CNN that “several strikes were conducted on terrorist targets” in the area of Beit Lahiya overnight. It said that there have been “continuous efforts to evacuate the civilian population from the active war zone in the area” and that “IDF is precisely operating and is doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to civilians.”
Separately, Israeli strikes targeted al-Bureij in central Gaza killing 23 people, according to Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were taken. CNN has also reached out to the IDF for comment on those strikes.
“It was a very terrifying night, with the sounds of small children screaming — every little one calling for their mother,” one resident in the area, Mahmoud Azaiza, said.
When asked about the Al-Bureij strike, the IDF told CNN it is “operating to dismantle Hamas military capabilities.”
Israel launched a renewed military offensive on Jabalya last month after Israeli intelligence indicated that Hamas was trying to rebuild its capabilities in the area. The offensive displaced thousands of Palestinians and killed dozens.
The operation has inflicted losses on the Israeli military, with 20 soldiers declared to have been killed in northern Gaza since the operation began, including four last week, according to statements published by the IDF since October 6.

“This operation to systematically dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the area will continue as long as required in order to achieve its objectives,” the IDF said last month.
The continued offensive on Gaza coincides with Israel’s expanding operation in southern Lebanon. On Friday night, Israeli forces reached the village of Chama, some 61 miles from the capital of Beirut, in what is understood to be the deepest incursion into southern Lebanese territory.
Israeli forces withdrew after clashing with Hezbollah, Lebanese state media said.
Lebanon’s health ministry also reported that Israeli airstrikes on villages in the southern Tyre district on Sunday killed at least 11 people. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment.
Israeli airstrikes continued pounding the Lebanese capital on Sunday for the sixth consecutive day. The IDF renewed evacuation warnings Sunday morning for residents of Haret Hreik in the southern Beirut suburbs, where Hezbollah is known to have a strong presence. The Israeli military said its air force had conducted strikes on six Hezbollah military targets in Beirut’s southern outskirts, known as Dahiyeh.

245,Isreal,2024,11,"Netanyahu aide leaked classified document to influence public opinion on hostage negotiations, court says",Catherine Nicholls,"CNN
 — 
An aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is alleged to have leaked classified information to foreign press in the hopes of influencing public opinion on hostage negotiations, according to a court release published Sunday.
Eliezer Feldstein was arrested earlier this month for allegedly leaking “classified and sensitive intelligence information,” according to court documents. Sunday’s court release outlines more of the details surrounding this alleged leak.
According to the magistrate’s court of Rishon Lezion, the leak began when a non-commissioned officer (NCO) in the Israeli military reserves took a “highly sensitive and classified document” from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
In April this year, the NCO sent a copy of the document to Feldstein, who distributed it to Israeli media outlets in September “with the aim of influencing public opinion on the ongoing negotiations concerning the hostages,” the court release said.

Police arrest Netanyahu aide as opponents accuse him of leaking intelligence to thwart Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal
This came shortly after the Israeli military announced on September 1 that six Israeli hostages were killed in Gaza. Four of them were due to be released in the first wave of a potential deal.
Israeli media outlets were prevented from publishing articles related to the leaked document by the country’s censorship authorities, the court release said, so Feldstein “decided to bypass censorship and publish the document in foreign media.”
Two articles published in September, one in the United Kingdom’s Jewish Chronicle and another in Germany’s Bild, included information related to the leaks. Both cited Israeli intelligence sources and supported a narrative being pushed by Netanyahu at the time.
Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz – who quit Netanyahu’s wartime cabinet earlier this year – seized on the alleged leaks as a failure at the very top of government, with Gantz calling it a “national crime.”
Both blamed Netanyahu’s office for the leak, with Gantz accusing Netanyahu of leveraging the leaks for political gains.
A spokesperson for Netanyahu denied earlier this month that there were leaks from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), and said that the “person in question never participated in security-related discussions,” apparently referring to Feldstein.
The PMO also downplayed the possibility that the leak impacted negotiations with Hamas over the release of hostages from Gaza, calling the claim “ridiculous.”
CNN has reached out to Feldstein’s lawyer for comment.

 — 
As a bomb descended on a multi-story apartment building in Beirut’s Tayouneh area Friday, hundreds of onlookers gathered in the street at a traffic roundabout several hundred meters (yards) away.
Among them was an Associated Press photographer. Hassan Ammar had donned his flak jacket and helmet and rushed to the scene — taking up his position at a safe distance using a long lens — after the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning with a map marking the targeted building.
The Israeli army said the building contained facilities belonging to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.

However, Ammar had different associations with the building. He had grown up less than a kilometer (less than 0.6 miles) from it, and he had been there on multiple occasions.
When he was a child during the 15-year Lebanese civil war that ended in 1990, “this building was on the front line between Muslim and Christian neighborhoods,” the so-called Green Line, he recalled.
But in later years, Ammar said, he visited the building “many times.” There was a notary public on the first floor, and next door was a sports supply store where he used to shop. Next to the building was a cemetery where his family had loved ones buried.
“I know it very well,” he said.
Ammar said he even once considered renting an apartment in the building that was struck, or in the building next door — now he can’t remember which — because it had a beautiful view of the pine trees in Horsh Beirut, a large public park nearby.
When he heard the sound of the projectile overhead, Ammar had his camera already trained on the building set to a high shutter speed, and he began snapping photos immediately, capturing the bomb in mid-air and as it descended, ending with a massive explosion.
There were no immediate reports of casualties, but much of the building was reduced to rubble.

Richard Weir, a senior crisis, conflict and arms researcher at Human Rights Watch, reviewed close-up photos of Friday’s bomb to determine what type of weapon was used.
“The bomb and components visible in the photographs, including the strake, wire harness cover, and tail fin section, are consistent with a Mk-84 series 2,000-pound class general purpose bomb equipped with Boeing’s Joint Directed Attack Munition (JDAM) tail kit,” he said.
Weir added that “the use of large, air-dropped bombs, like these, that produce wide-area effects in populated areas carries significant risks to civilians and civilian objects.”
A few weeks earlier, another AP photographer, Bilal Hussein, had captured a nearly identical scene as a similar powerful bomb hit a nearby building in Beirut.
The Israeli military has maintained that it takes measures to reduce civilian casualties by issuing warnings before many of its strikes in Lebanon.

247,Isreal,2024,11,How different a commander in chief will Trump be?,Peter Bergen,"CNN
 — 
“When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold” is a saying used to describe how the massive American economy can affect global businesses, but it also applies to foreign policy in the Trump era.
President-elect Donald Trump’s electoral mandate gives him considerable leverage when he is in office to implement his “America First” policies. Officials in capitals around the globe are now trying to game out what will change once Trump is inaugurated.
On the face of it, there are sizable differences in foreign policy between Trump and President Joe Biden. Trump’s isolationist instincts mean that he will build walls around the US — whether physically, at the southern border, or by using tariffs to raise the prices of imports of foreign goods into the country. Trump will also likely take a skeptical line on alliances such as NATO, pull out of international agreements negotiated with dozens of other countries such as the Paris Climate Agreement, and ration or even end US support for Ukraine in the war with Russia.
Yet — surprisingly, perhaps — on some critical foreign policy issues, Trump and the Biden administration are on the same page, and Trump 2.0 will likely see some important continuities with the Biden approach when it comes to China, the Middle East and the withdrawal of US troops who are posted overseas.
China
In his first term, Trump inaugurated a far more combative approach to China, abandoning the fantasies of previous US administrations that Beijing would, as it grew economically, also liberalize politically. Instead, the Trump administration started treating it as a potential rival, for instance, increasing “freedom of navigation” exercises in the South China Sea, much of which China claims as its own. The Trump team also slapped a wide range of tariffs on thousands of Chinese goods.
When Biden got to the White House, he kept Trump’s more hardline approach to China in place, holding on to Trump’s tariffs and going even further by slapping a 100% tax on Chinese electric vehicles and banning investments in China by US companies that might benefit the Chinese military. The Biden administration shored up its alliances to contain Beijing, such as the 2021 agreement between the US, the United Kingdom and Australia known as AUKUS, which provides nuclear-powered submarines to the Australians.
It’s reasonable to assume that in his second term, Trump won’t stray much from the playbook his first administration inaugurated, a playbook that was amplified by Biden.

There could be differences between Trump and Biden on the fate of the democratically governed island of Taiwan, which the Chinese have long claimed is part of China and which is also a US ally. Biden, in 2022, publicly said that the US would defend Taiwan if China invaded, abandoning the US policy of “strategic ambiguity,” which was supposed to keep the Chinese guessing about how the US might respond if they invaded the island.
An invasion of Taiwan is a problem Trump might have to deal with during his second term; the CIA believes that China’s President Xi Jinping has told his People’s Liberation Army to be ready to invade by 2027. (The Chinese could alternatively mount a naval blockade of Taiwan and slowly strangle the island to get the Taiwanese to agree to a deal that would make them a quasi-autonomous territory of China.)
What Trump might do if the Chinese invaded Taiwan or blockaded Taiwan is anyone’s guess. In July, Trump said, “Taiwan should pay us for defense,” which doesn’t suggest that he would be in any hurry to send American troops to defend the island if the Chinese invaded or blockaded it.
Last year, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, mounted a war game of a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan. Running the war game 24 times, it concluded, “The United States and its allies lost dozens of ships, hundreds of aircraft, and tens of thousands of service members.” Given Trump’s isolationist instincts, that’s a price he may not want to pay when he is president
The Middle East
In the Middle East, there will likely be a high degree of continuity between Biden and Trump. Despite Biden’s occasional chastising of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the civilian casualties caused by the Israeli military in Gaza, Biden has given Netanyahu more or less a free hand to do what he wants to do in Gaza against Hamas and in Lebanon against Iran-backed Hezbollah.
After the Israelis killed a top Iranian general in Syria in April, the Biden administration assembled an international coalition to protect Israel when Iran fired hundreds of drones and missiles against Israel, strikes that didn’t cause significant damage in Israel. In October, the Biden administration again helped to intercept a barrage of around 200 Iranian ballistic missiles, which also caused minimal damage to targets in Israel.
On Iran, the Biden team made some early efforts to resuscitate the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with the Iranians, but in the end the Biden administration did not renew the agreement.
In the past year, the Biden team has also repeatedly authorized strikes against the Iranian-supported Houthis in Yemen. In support of Hamas, the Houthis are routinely firing drones and missiles targeting shipping along the critical Red Sea global trade route.

It’s hard to imagine Biden’s “bear hug” of Israel and his administration’s tough line on Iranian proxies like the Houthis changing much under Trump.
After all, when he was in office, Trump ignored Israel’s much-expanded settlement-building in the West Bank. At the same time, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner negotiated the Abraham Accords, which established diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab states but gave nothing to the Palestinians. Trump also ordered the assassination of the top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, when he was visiting Iraq in 2020.
Before the effort was derailed by the October 7, 2023, massacre by Hamas in Israel and the war in Gaza, the Biden administration was in the process of trying to extend the Abraham Accords, brokering a deal where Saudi Arabia recognized Israel for the first time.
In short, there isn’t much to distinguish Biden and Trump on their overall policies in the Middle East, even if some of Trump’s supporters have claimed that Biden is weak on Israel and Iran.
However, the nomination of former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be Trump’s ambassador to Israel — Huckabee has claimed there is “no such thing as a Palestinian” — might indicate more sympathy in a Trump administration than in the Biden administration for the annexation of parts of the West Bank by Israel. Indeed, during Trump’s first term, his ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, said the Trump administration could support Israel if it annexed parts of the West Bank.
Also, the indictment last week of an Iranian who was allegedly trying to assassinate Trump will surely not endear the Iranians further to the incoming president. Once Trump is in office, we can expect to see his team ramping up sanctions on Iran, including trying to curtail its oil sales. The US has been sanctioning the Iranian regime for decades with negligible effects on the regime’s behavior. After the Trump administration in 2018 pulled out of the nuclear deal with Iran, which was preventing the Iranians from enriching uranium anywhere close to weapons grade, the Iranians now have enough fissile material for several nuclear weapons, according to the US Defense Intelligence Agency.
Bringing US troops home
In 2020, the Trump administration signed a US withdrawal agreement from Afghanistan with the Taliban. Biden went through with that plan in the summer of 2021, withdrawing the 2,500 US troops that remained in the country and enabling the Taliban to seize power once again in Afghanistan.
Similarly, the Biden administration has been negotiating the withdrawal of an unspecified number of the 2,500 US troops in Iraq who are there to fight what remains of ISIS. Given that Trump has long been skeptical about the US military presence in the Middle East, this agreement is likely to continue to go forward.
The big changes coming: Personnel is policy
“Personnel is policy” was a mantra of the Reagan years. Now that Team Trump is heading back into office, they understand how the foreign policy and national security apparatus works, which they didn’t at the beginning of Trump’s first term. They plan to change that at the senior level and possibly at the level of career foreign service officers and intelligence officers. In 2021, JD Vance — now vice president-elect — advised Trump during a podcast appearance to “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat, every civil servant in the administrative state, replace them with our people.”
In the first Trump term, some top officials, such as his second national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, influenced Trump to make sensible decisions, such as reversing Trump’s inclination to pull all US troops out of Afghanistan. But after McMaster was pushed out of office in 2018, the Trump administration negotiated with the Taliban the withdrawal agreement of all US forces from Afghanistan. There will likely be very few independent voices like McMaster’s in the incoming administration.
Loyalty is, of course, the supreme virtue in the Trump universe. Trump publicly nixed his former UN ambassador, Nikki Haley, and his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, from any of the top jobs in his administration. Haley ran against Trump in the GOP primary, and Pompeo considered whether he would make a presidential run. Trump is looking for a team of ultraloyalists, such as senior House Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, whom he has offered the role of UN ambassador.
Loyalty to the president is standard practice for members of the cabinet, and simply because an appointee is loyal to Trump doesn’t mean that at least some aren’t well qualified for a cabinet role.
Take Trump’s pick to be his national security adviser, Republican Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida. Waltz is a retired Special Forces colonel who served in the reserves with multiple tours in Afghanistan. He has also run a small business; written two books; served for the past five years in Congress, where he has been an active member of the House Armed Services Committee; worked in a policy role at the Pentagon; and worked in the White House during the George W. Bush administration as a policy adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan.
All in all, Waltz is about as qualified to be national security adviser as anyone who had the job in the past, having both fought on the battlefields of Afghanistan and having a deep understanding of the ways of Washington, on the Hill, in the Pentagon and at the White House. (Disclosure: I have known Rep. Waltz for the past decade and half.)
On the other hand, the nomination of Pete Hegseth — a Fox News host who had served in the US military, retiring as a major, with no experience of running much of anything other than a small nonprofit — to lead the Pentagon’s close to 3 million employees is perplexing.
Hegseth is also an odd choice for secretary of defense when you compare him to some other recent secretaries, such as the retired four-star generals Lloyd Austin and Jim Mattis, or Robert Gates, who had worked in various US government roles for decades, including as the director of the CIA. It will be interesting to see how Hegseth’s nomination fares in the Senate, where Republicans have a slim majority.
US Civil Servants to become ‘at will’ employees?
The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, which was largely put together by Trump administration alumni and the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, outlines plans to ensure loyalists are appointed at every level in critical national security agencies.
Trump has publicly disavowed Project 2025, but as CNN reported, at least 140 people who had worked with him also worked on the project. Tellingly, Project 2025 produced an 887-page report that includes separate chapters on the State Department, the intelligence community, the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, all written by officials with senior positions in the first Trump administration.
These chapters seem to be predicated on the belief that a fifth column of State Department foreign service officers and US intelligence officials would stymie a conservative president like Trump at every turn, so they should be replaced with loyalists.
The America First Policy Institute goes further in its policy recommendations, advocating that civil servants become “at-will” employees effectively. It states, “Agencies should be free to remove employees for any non-discriminatory reason, with no external appeals.”
If this were implemented, every American agency would be staffed with political loyalists, which would go back to the 19th century before the US had a merit-based professional civil service standing ready to serve presidents of either party.
Also, why join the State Department or the CIA and go through all the trouble of learning difficult languages or mastering arcane disciplines like arms control negotiations if you could lose your job any time a new president comes into office?
If the Trump team attempts to remove career foreign service and intelligence officers, expect to see federal unions fighting in court. Also, there may be significant resignations in some agencies if officials feel that their expertise in foreign affairs or work in intelligence is being seriously undermined.
Nonetheless, the incoming Trump administration seems intent on resurrecting Schedule F, an executive order issued in the last months of the first Trump term. Schedule F would turn the typical number of around 4,000 political appointees at the top of every federal agency and instead appoint as many as 50,000 political appointees, the vast majority of whom would presumably replace career civil servants.
This seems like a particularly bad idea when it comes to the US intelligence community, which is paid to tell the president news he may not want to hear or that doesn’t fit with his preconceptions about the world. For precisely this reason, typically there are just four political appointees at the CIA, and similarly small numbers at the other US intelligence agencies.
The nomination of Trump loyalist former Rep. John Ratcliffe of Texas to run the CIA has not generated much criticism, since he is a known quantity to the US intelligence community, having served on the House Intelligence Committee and during the first Trump term as the director of national intelligence, who oversees the 18 American intelligence agencies. But the nomination of former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii to be the next director of national intelligence will surely encounter headwinds, given her past support for American rivals like Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Syrian dictator Basher al-Assad, both of whom are key intelligence collection targets for US spy agencies.
Ukraine and the future of NATO
Trump has said he could get a deal done to end the war in Ukraine in a day. That seems implausible since Russia and Ukraine have already been fighting for a decade.
Still, given Trump’s desire to be seen as a great negotiator, perhaps he could get a deal now that Ukraine is beginning to lose the war to the Russians. According to a report by the US Congressional Research Service last month, the average age of Ukrainian soldiers is 40, a figure that speaks for itself. The Ukrainians also know that the Republican-controlled Congress will likely not support spending billions more to fund their war.
Meanwhile, the fact that the Russians are deploying North Korean soldiers to fight their war against the Ukrainians suggests that Putin doesn’t want to order the kind of mass mobilization in Russia that would be unpopular. So he may have his own interests in winding down the war on terms he deems favorable.

The overall contours of a deal that could end the fighting could be that Russia keeps Crimea, which it seized in 2014, and Ukraine gets back some of the territories in eastern Ukraine that Russia has taken. In return, Ukraine doesn’t get to join NATO, but it does get security guarantees from the US of the kind that Japan has. Neither the Russians nor the Ukrainians will be happy with elements of this deal, but the alternative is a forever war in which already around a million people on both sides have been killed and wounded.
When it comes to NATO, Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, told me in 2023 for the Audible podcast “In the Room” that Trump “would fundamentally reexamine the premise of NATO, which is the predicate for what I think he would do in a second Trump term, which is withdraw the United States from NATO itself.” But earlier this year, the US Congress made it harder for an American president to pull out of NATO, ensuring that it would take a supermajority vote in the US Senate, or an act passed by the full Congress to pull the US out of the alliance.
Yet, Trump can greatly undercut NATO and the reason for its existence, which is collective self-defense, with his public statements because he is the commander in chief of the most important country in the alliance. In February, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any NATO member country that didn’t spend 2 percent of its GDP on its defense.
Earlier this month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said that Putin’s ambitions are greater than just conquering Ukraine: “Russia is conducting an intensifying campaign of hybrid attacks across our allied territories, interfering directly in our democracies, sabotaging industry, and committing violence. … This shows that the shift of the frontline in this war is no longer solely in Ukraine. Increasingly, the frontline is moving beyond borders to the Baltic region, to Western Europe.”
Given Trump’s odd bromance with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russia will likely feel empowered to continue these efforts to undermine NATO countries, knowing Trump may not push back.
Deportations
The announcement last weekend that Tom Homan, an immigration hardliner who was Trump’s acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during his first term, will serve as “border czar” shows that the incoming Trump administration will take a tough line on deportations. Making the Homan announcement, Trump tweeted that he “will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin.”
When Trump was last in office, his administration separated more than 3,000 migrant children from their families. At a CNN town hall last year, Trump indicated this policy could return, saying, “When you say to a family that if you come, we’re going to break you up, they don’t come.”
Trump, of course, has even bigger plans for his second term, including the mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. According to Department of Homeland Security estimates from 2022, about 11 million unauthorized migrants were living in the US. The actual number could be much higher, and Trump has mentioned a figure of 15-20 million illegal immigrants that he plans to deport.
The Trump team will likely begin by deporting those unauthorized migrants charged with a crime, according to CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez, but removing all unauthorized migrants will involve significant logistical, financial and legal hurdles.
The American Immigration Council, a liberal policy group, estimated in a report issued last month that it would cost almost a trillion dollars over the next decade to remove the many millions of illegal immigrants in the US. Where will this funding come from? Trump said last week in an interview with NBC News. “It’s not a question of a price tag. It’s not — really, we have no choice.”
The Supreme Court has ruled that migrants living in the US are entitled to due process before they are deported. Migrants awaiting legal proceedings will need to be held somewhere. Rounding up millions of migrants and holding millions of hearings will necessitate the hiring of many immigration agents and judges, not to mention that new detention facilities will need to be built. To give you a sense of the scale required, the US Bureau of Prisons said in 2022 that there were around 1.2 million prisoners in the US.
After Trump won the election, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said that she would not allow her state police to be used to deport residents.
Stephen Miller, Trump’s choice to be deputy chief of staff for policy, has said in the past that the National Guard could be used in deportations in states where there are uncooperative local governments. Earlier this year, Trump also told TIME that he would have “no problem using the military, per se,” for deportations.
TV images of American soldiers detaining and deporting men, women and children would likely not play well with many Americans.
Tariffs
Both Trump and Biden imposed tariffs on goods that are made in China, such as shoes and luggage, and Biden went a step further by putting 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, but Trump has a plan to go even bigger on taxing imports, promising to put 60% tariffs on all Chinese goods and 10% tariffs on goods imported from anywhere else in the world. Let’s see what comes of this, since tariffs are a tax on ordinary American consumers and are inflationary since they drive up prices. Also, it’s unclear whether Trump could impose tariffs on imports from every nation, since only the US Congress has the power to tax, while the president can impose tariffs on countries like China only if they are engaged in unfair trade practices, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.
Climate change
Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement a few months into his first term and, while he was president, told CBS’s “60 Minutes” that climate change will “change back again” and “I don’t know that it’s man-made.” Don’t expect anything different in his second term, even though 2024 is on track to be the hottest year on record, and the US is the world’s largest oil and gas producer and its second-largest carbon emitter.
A predictably unpredictable commander in chief
Trump is predictably unpredictable; early in his first term, his then-national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, for instance, persuaded Trump to stay the course and not pull all US troops out of Afghanistan. Then Trump changed his mind and authorized his team to make a withdrawal deal with the Taliban, at one point even inviting Taliban leaders to Camp David and then changing his mind and disinviting them.
It’s not out of the question that Trump, who sees himself as a great dealmaker, could try to reach an agreement in the Middle East that would normalize relations between the Saudis and Israelis in exchange for a genuine two-state solution. Trump could also try to end the war in Ukraine — if not with a formal peace deal, at least with the kind of armistice that has prevented conflict on the Korean Peninsula since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
It’s worth recalling, however, that despite all the much-ballyhooed summits and “love letters” that Trump exchanged with the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un, the great dealmaker couldn’t make a deal that eliminated or even slowed down North Korea’s nuclear program.
What is likely is that Trump will keep in place the tougher policies on China that he initiated, and that Biden inherited and amplified. In the Middle East, Trump will largely follow the playbook he followed when he was president: Israel gets what it wants, a policy Biden has also followed. On two of the most significant issues facing the United States, its competition with China and the future course of the Middle East there will likely be considerable continuities between the two administrations.
Where Trump will clearly depart from Biden is he that may find ways to undermine NATO; he will oversee mass deportations of illegal immigrants possibly involving the US military; he will undercut efforts to slow climate change; and he might get into a serious trade war with the world’s second-largest economy, with all the knock-on effects that might have on the global economy. In short, it will be an isolationist “America First” approach to the world enforced by Trump loyalists at all of his agencies.

248,General Politics,2024,11,"More Biden judges will be confirmed, but four appeals court nominees won’t see a vote under Senate deal",Tierney Sneed,"CNN
 — 
Senate leaders have reached a deal that will smooth the path for Democrats to confirm several of President Joe Biden’s district court nominees, averting Republican procedural tactics that significantly slowed down the process, in exchange for ending efforts to confirm four pending appeals court nominees.
Liberal court activists are already bashing the agreement, reached late Wednesday night, for how it will aid President-elect Donald Trump’s ability to pick up on his makeover of federal circuit courts when he returns to the White House.
However, the four Biden appellate nominees already faced tough odds of confirmation, with some, like 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals nominee Adeel Mangi, facing opposition among Democrats as well.
RELATED ARTICLE
EXCLUSIVE: Ethics committee told of second sexual encounter between Matt Gaetz and 17-year-old at party, sources say
“The trade was four circuit nominees — all lacking the votes to get confirmed — for more than triple the number of additional judges moving forward,” a spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.
The deal comes after Trump called for Republicans to do everything they could to stop the Democratic-led Senate from confirming Biden’s remaining judicial nominees before the change of party control in Washington next year. Even when they haven’t had the numbers to block Biden picks outright, Republicans have employed various floor maneuvers that greatly increased the amount of time the Senate had to spend on each of the pending nominees.
Not counting the four Biden picks that, under the Senate’s agreement, will not come up for a vote, there are about 14 judicial nominees – all of them for district courts – in the pipeline, though two of them are still going through the committee process.
The Senate deal puts Biden in a position to potentially beat Trump’s record of number of district court judges confirmed. However, even before the Democrats’ decision to forgo trying to confirm the four pending circuit nominees, Biden was not going to be able to match Trump’s overhaul of the federal appellate bench and the Supreme Court.
Trump inherited 17 circuit vacancies at the beginning of his first term – in addition to an open Supreme Court seat – in large part because of obstruction tactics by the GOP-controlled Senate at the end of the Obama administration. Senate Republicans then changed a key rule for appellate nominees that made it easier for Trump to fill those vacancies, which further limited the number of circuit openings available for Biden to try to fill.
Trump will not have those same advantages next year when he begins his second term, which will start with far fewer judicial vacancies than he had at the start of his first administration.
Still, Demand Justice, an organization that advocates for progressive judicial nominees, blasted the new deal for depriving the four Biden circuit nominees of floor votes. In a statement, the group’s managing director Maggie Jo Buchanan accused Senate Democrats of “willingly gifting Donald Trump the chance to appoint judges more committed to political agendas than the rule of law.”
Demand Justice and other advocacy groups called for Democrats to make confirming judges the top priority for the lame-duck session, a sentiment Senate Democrats shared.
Those efforts were always going to face headwinds and got more arduous when Trump demanded that Senate Republicans blockade all pending Biden nominees for the bench. That unified opposition was exacerbated by Independent Sen. Joe Manchin’s tendency of voting against nominees that don’t have any Republican support, as well as by opposition to some Biden picks by Independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.

Absences by Trump’s Senate pals help Democrats confirm Biden judges
Earlier this week Democrats, benefiting from GOP absences – including from several Senate Republicans who were away from Washington – confirmed an 11th Circuit nominee and several trial judges, even as they faced unified Republican opposition.
Under the new deal, Republicans backed off procedural tactics that would stymie the confirmations of six district nominees that were on the floor Wednesday night and on Thursday. Those six nominees, and other Biden picks for federal trial courts, are expected to get final confirmation votes after the Thanksgiving break. Another Biden nominee, for the federal trial court in Arizona, was confirmed Thursday afternoon.

249,General Politics,2024,11,Gaetz withdraws from attorney general consideration,Eric Bradner,"CNN
 — 
Former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz said Thursday that he is withdrawing as President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for attorney general, writing on social media that his nomination “was unfairly becoming a distraction.”
Gaetz’s withdrawal comes after meetings with Republican senators this week, as Trump’s transition team sought to gauge whether he would win enough GOP support to be confirmed and Democrats were pushing to release a House Ethics Committee report into the former congressman.
RELATED ARTICLE
EXCLUSIVE: Ethics committee told of second sexual encounter between Matt Gaetz and 17-year-old at party, sources say
“I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback - and the incredible support of so many. While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,” Gaetz wrote on X.
“There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I’ll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General. Trump’s DOJ must be in place and ready on Day 1.”
Gaetz’s decision — which he made on his own, according to two sources familiar with the matter —was praised by several Senate Republicans, whose reactions offered a glimpse at the difficulties he faced after years of battling with members of his own party in Congress.
Democrats were pressing for the disclosure of the House Ethics Committee report detailing its investigation into Gaetz, including over allegations of sexual misconduct and other alleged crimes, after the panel’s Republicans voted on Wednesday not to release the probe’s results.
Gaetz has vehemently denied the allegations investigated by the Justice Department and the committee, including the claim that he had sex with a woman in 2017 when she was a minor.
CNN reported Thursday that sources familiar with her testimony said the woman told the ethics committee she had two sexual encounters with Gaetz at one 2017 party, when she was 17 years old. She testified that the second sexual encounter, which has not previously been reported, included another adult woman. She also testified to both sexual encounters in a civil deposition as part of a related lawsuit, sources said.
After being asked for comment for CNN’s story, Gaetz announced his withdrawal as Trump’s nominee for attorney general.
Trump and members of his transition team were notified that Gaetz would be withdrawing before he made the announcement, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Gaetz called Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance separately to inform them of his decision to withdraw, per one source familiar with the calls.
There was a belief that more damning information would be coming out from the ethics report, and that members of Gaetz’s orbit learned there might be witnesses who had been interviewed by the committee who had been previously unknown, one source familiar said.
Multiple sources also said that while Gaetz’s meetings with GOP senators on Wednesday were not negative, it became clear that there were too many hard “Nos” from them, and that information expected to come out of the ethics report would likely make confirmation impossible.
While Trump was all in on Gaetz and believed he was the right person to “disrupt” the Justice Department, as one Trump adviser characterized it, many allies and advisers helping with the transition had serious doubts about Gaetz’s ability to make it through Senate confirmation hearings, two sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. Those doubts had been shared directly with Trump.
Sources briefed on the meetings Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance held with those Republican senators said they felt the lawmakers were keeping an open mind on Gaetz, but there was clear uneasiness in the Senate about what could still unfold regarding the allegations against him.
Reacting to the news, Trump on Thursday said Gaetz was “doing very well” and suggested he has a bright future. “I greatly appreciate the recent efforts of Matt Gaetz in seeking approval to be Attorney General. He was doing very well but, at the same time, did not want to be a distraction for the Administration, for which he has much respect. Matt has a wonderful future, and I look forward to watching all of the great things he will do!” the president-elected posted on X.
“President Trump remains committed to choosing a leader for the Department of Justice who will strongly defend the Constitution and end the weaponization of our justice system,” Trump-Vance spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “President Trump will announce his new decision when it is made.”
Trump does not have a new name in mind for attorney general and now returns to the drawing board, two people familiar with the matter told CNN.
Trump has selected other controversial Cabinet picks, including former Fox News host Pete Hegseth for secretary of the Defense Department and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for the Department of Health and Human Services. Hegseth, who faces a sexual assault allegation that he has denied, is meeting with senators on Thursday.
GOP senators glad Gaetz withdrew
Several Republican senators said they were glad to see Gaetz withdraw — making public the backlash that the former Florida congressman, best known on Capitol Hill for his role in ousting former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, faced within his own party.
“It’s a good thing,” Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the outgoing party leader, said.
Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said she was “pleased” with Gaetz’s decision.
Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who has been vocal in his past criticism of Gaetz, said his withdrawal “was probably a good decision.”
South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds said Gaetz’s efforts to win confirmation “would have been problematic.”
“I’m not second guessing the president. The president has the right to make the nominations that he sees fit,” Rounds said. “But the Senate also has a responsibility for advice and consent and in this particular case, I think there was advice offered, rather than consent.”
Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, said Gaetz’s withdrawal is a “positive development.”
Sen. Cynthia Lummis said Gaetz “must have gotten some signals yesterday during conversations that he was having with senators that this was going to be a distraction.”
“He felt this was going to be a major distraction and so good on him to recognize and be self aware to provide President Trump with an opportunity to choose someone who’s equally tenacious about addressing the Department of Justice,” the Wyoming Republican said.
Florida Sen. Rick Scott, however, said he was “disappointed” that Gaetz withdrew.
“I’m disappointed. I’ve known Matt since I started running for governor, and he was a smart guy, worked hard. I had a great, great working relationship with him,” he said.
Will Gaetz return to Congress?
Senior congressional leaders in both parties are scrambling to determine if Gaetz — who resigned from the current Congress earlier this month — can return to the House next year after winning reelection this fall.
Lawmakers and senior aides believe that Gaetz can still return in January — a scenario that some have privately feared could happen all along, according to more than a dozen sources.
Even though Gaetz said in his resignation letter that he does “not intend to take the oath of office” in January, congressional sources say he is still on track to be named to the seat because the governor has not called a special election and he cannot preemptively resign from a Congress that has not started yet.
But it’s a complicated question with murky legal precedent. Some lawmakers have already asked the parliamentarian to weigh in and clear up the confusion, one source told CNN.
Democrats anticipate the ethics findings are unlikely to emerge because of Republican opposition, and the investigation as it stands will be over when the next Congress begins, according to multiple Republican and Democratic sources.
But Gaetz’s decision also has ramifications for the current Congress. Although GOP lawmakers were willing to block the ethics report this week, there were signals that more Republicans would want to release it if Gaetz were on the cusp of being confirmed as attorney general. It would only take four House Republicans to join Democrats in voting to release it on the House floor, or one Republican from the Ethics Committee when the panel next meets on December 5.
“We anticipate that there would be a growing number of members who would want this report released,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN.

 — 
A high-ranking member of a Mexican drug cartel who allegedly faked his own death and has been living in California under a fake name is now facing federal charges, the US Justice Department announced Thursday.
Cristian Fernando Gutierrez-Ochoa, a member of the Cártel de Jalisco Nueva Generación and the son-in-law of the cartel’s leader El Mencho, was on the run from Mexican authorities when he fled to the United States, assumed a fake identity and had moved into a luxury Riverside apartment when he was arrested earlier this month, according to prosecutors.
The 37-year-old Gutierrez-Ochoa is charged with international drug trafficking and money laundering.
“The Jalisco Cartel — one of the world’s most violent and prolific drug trafficking organizations — is weaker today because of the tenacious efforts of law enforcement to track down and arrest a cartel leader who allegedly faked his own death and assumed a false identity to evade justice and live a life of luxury in California,” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement Thursday.
Prosecutors say that before he went into hiding, Gutierrez-Ochoa personally orchestrated the transportation and distribution of 40,000 kilograms of methamphetamine and 2,000 kilograms of cocaine from Mexico to the United States. He also allegedly kidnapped two members of the Mexican Navy as part of an attempt to release his mother-in-law, El Mencho’s wife, after her arrest by Mexican authorities.
El Mencho then allegedly helped Gutierrez-Ochoa fake his death to evade Mexican law enforcement by telling his associates that he had killed Gutierrez-Ochoa for lying. The scheme allowed Gutierrez-Ochoa to run to California and be with El Mencho’s daughter.
The Justice Department charged El Mencho in 2022 with leading the effort to manufacture and distribute fentanyl for importation into the US. He has not been arrested, and the State Department is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest and/or conviction.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/mexican-cartel-leader-fake-death-arrest/index.html
251,General Politics,2024,11,Police report reveals new details from sexual assault allegation against Trump’s defense secretary nominee,Casey Tolan,"CNN
 — 
A California woman told police that Trump Cabinet pick Pete Hegseth physically blocked her from leaving a hotel room, took her phone, and then sexually assaulted her even though she “remembered saying ‘no’ a lot,” a police report obtained by CNN shows.
The 22-page report, released by the city attorney’s office of Monterey, California, on Wednesday night in response to a public records request, lays out the competing narratives of what happened in new detail – including conflicting accounts of how intoxicated Hegseth and the woman were, and descriptions of video surveillance showing some of their movements that night.
Hegseth, who President-elect Donald Trump has named as his pick for secretary of defense, told police that their encounter was consensual, and that he had repeatedly made sure the woman “was comfortable with what was going on between the two of them.”
Seven years after the alleged assault, questions over what happened that night could jeopardize Hegseth’s nomination and seem likely to be central in his upcoming confirmation hearing.

Hegseth tells Republicans that ‘this is a battle that is just beginning’
Hegseth was not charged with a crime in connection with the allegation. His attorney has acknowledged that Hegseth later entered into a settlement agreement with his accuser that included an undisclosed monetary payment and a confidentiality clause. Though Hegseth insisted the encounter was consensual, the lawyer said he was fearful that the woman was poised to make an allegation against him during the #MeToo movement that might have cost him his job as a Fox News host.
“This police report confirms what I’ve said all along, that the incident was fully investigated, and police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed,” Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth’s attorney, told CNN on Wednesday night – although the report does not say that police found the allegations to be false.
In a statement, Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump’s transition team, also claimed that “police found the allegations to be false” and called Hegseth “a highly-respected Combat Veteran who will honorably serve our country when he is confirmed as the next Secretary of Defense, just like he honorably served our country on the battlefield in uniform.”
The woman who accused Hegseth of assault broke into tears when asked about the matter by CNN reporters last week and declined to comment.
According to the newly released police report, the alleged assault took place in the early morning hours of October 8, 2017, after Hegseth spoke at a convention of the California Federation of Republican Women at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa the night before.
An attorney for the city of Monterey, which had previously shared only cursory details about its investigation, wrote that the city was releasing a redacted version of the police report because it had previously released a copy to Hegseth in 2021.
The report, which identifies the accuser as “Jane Doe,” summarizes police interviews with Doe, Hegseth, conference attendees and a hotel employee, and includes descriptions of video footage from the hotel viewed by police.
The records released do not include copies of the video footage, or a memorandum from the Monterey County district attorney’s office that could explain why Hegseth was never charged. The DA’s office has denied public records requests for its files on the case, citing state law.
The police report’s description of Doe’s account of the night mirrors some of the details laid out in a memo written by a friend of Doe and delivered to the Trump transition team last week, which sparked consternation among Trump’s advisers, who were caught off guard by the allegation.
Both Doe and Hegseth, as well as several attendees interviewed by police, told officers that the two of them went with a group to the hotel bar, Knuckles, after the speech and an afterparty in a hotel suite.
There, a conference attendee told police that Hegseth had touched her knee and invited her to come to his hotel room. The attendee said she declined the invitation and “gained the attention” of Doe and had her become what the report describes as a “crotch blocker” – hoping that Doe’s “presence would detour Hegseth’s attempt to have sex” with her. That attendee later left the bar and said Doe didn’t appear intoxicated “when she last had contact with” her.
Another conference attendee told police that she saw what she described as Doe and another woman flirting with Hegseth at the bar. At the time, Doe was coherent and “did not seem intoxicated to a point where she would not be able to care for her own safety,” the attendee said.

Doe told officers that she believed Hegseth was acting inappropriately with the other women during the conference, and texted someone that he “was giving off a ‘creeper’ vibe,” according to the report. Doe later told a hospital nurse that she “was not sure, but believes that something may have been slipped into her drink, as she cannot remember most of the night’s events,” and the nurse passed that on to police, the report states. The report also notes Doe said she had been drinking “much more than normal” that day.
Officers reviewed surveillance video from the hotel timestamped about 1:15 a.m. that showed Doe and Hegseth “walking together, with arms locked together” leaving the bar and heading toward the hotel pool, with Doe smiling.
Doe told police she remembered walking out of the bar and arguing with Hegseth by the pool, where the two argued about his treatment of women at the conference and Hegseth told her he was “a nice guy.” Police also interviewed a hotel employee, who responded to guest complaints about the argument around 1:30 a.m. Hegseth told the employee “that he had freedom of speech,” before he and Doe left, the employee remembered. The employee said that Hegseth appeared to be heavily intoxicated, while Doe did not, according to the report.
Doe told police that her next memory after the argument was being in a hotel room with Hegseth. She told officers that Hegseth “took her phone from her hands.” Then, she said, she “tried to leave the room, but Hegseth blocked the door with his body.” She said she “remembered saying ‘no’ a lot,” but did not remember much else, according to the report.
Next, she said, she remembered Hegseth over her on a bed or couch, with his dog tags “hovering over her face.” She later told the hospital nurse that she “could not remember whether or not any sexual penetration occurred, but believes that she was sexually assaulted at that time,” the nurse told police.
Doe told police that she remembered Hegseth ejaculating onto her stomach before throwing a towel at her and asking if she was OK. Doe told police she did not remember how she got back to her own hotel room, but remembered walking into her room and getting in bed.
Doe’s husband, who attended the conference with her, told police that he was worried when she didn’t come back to their hotel room earlier that night, and that she didn’t return until about 4 a.m.
Doe told officers that “the incident involving Hegseth did not dawn on” her until after she returned home. She went to a hospital and reported a sexual assault on October 12, where she underwent a rape kit exam and gave the clothes she was wearing on the night of the alleged assault to police. A nurse at the hospital first reported the alleged assault to authorities.
Hegseth, in contrast, told police that the encounter with Doe was consensual. He said that he was “buzzed” that night after drinking beer and remembered going back to his hotel room with Doe.
Hegseth said that Doe “sat down in the room and did not leave,” and that he thought it was “odd” that she stayed in his room, according to the report.
As the night progressed, Hegseth said he made sure Doe was “comfortable with what was going on between the two of them,” and that there was “‘always’ conversation and ‘always’ consensual contact.” The two of them had sexual intercourse, he said.
Hegseth said that Doe asked him if he had a condom, and he didn’t. He said he asked her if that was a problem, and she said it wasn’t, and he ejaculated on her body.
After they had sex, Hegseth said, he had a “very clear conversation” with Doe, who told him she would tell her husband she had “fallen asleep on a couch in someone else’s room.” He told police that she showed “early signs of regret,” but did not elaborate.

The woman who says she had sex when she was a minor with then-Rep. Matt Gaetz told the House Ethics Committee she had two sexual encounters with him at one party in 2017, sources familiar with her testimony tell CNN.
The woman, who was 17 years old at the time, testified that the second sexual encounter, which has not previously been reported, included another adult woman. She also testified to both sexual encounters in a civil deposition as part of a related lawsuit, sources said.

Gaetz has repeatedly denied having sex with a minor and was not charged after the Justice Department investigated these alleged encounters.
Gaetz and Trump were working to lock down support on Capitol Hill for the former Florida congressman to become the next attorney general. Members of the Republican-led House Ethics panel voted along party lines on Wednesday not to release the results of their investigation and instead decided to meet again on December 5 to vote on the final report.
The other woman who was an adult at the time has denied participating in the alleged second encounter, according to multiple sources familiar with her ethics testimony.

The Justice Department closed its investigation of Gaetz last year after prosecutors recommended that no criminal charges be brought against him. The House Ethics Committee revived its investigation of the Florida lawmaker once DOJ concluded its case and is facing mounting pressure to release its final report.
Allegations against Gaetz also have surfaced as part of a civil dispute in federal court in Florida. The deposition from the woman who was 17 at the time remains under seal, but her allegations were described during another deposition that is public record. At one point, attorneys recounted that she had testified having sex with Gaetz on an air hockey table at the house party while the homeowner watched.
An attorney for the woman who was a minor at the time of the sexual encounters has called for the ethics report to be released “immediately,” noting that his client was a high school student at the time and saying there were witnesses.
Joel Leppard, an attorney who represents two other women who were witnesses in the House Ethics Committee probe, said one of his clients testified that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a minor. Leppard said his client told the committee she did not believe Gaetz knew at the time that her friend was underage.
Both of Leppard’s clients sat for closed-door testimony before the committee. He has said that both them testified that Gaetz paid them for “sexual favors.”

 — 
House GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene announced that she will chair a new oversight subcommittee in the next Congress that will work with the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.
House Oversight Chair James Comer “intends to establish a new Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency (DOGE) for the 119th Congress,” a source familiar told CNN, confirming that Greene will chair the subcommittee.
Comer and Greene, a staunch supporter of President-elect Donald Trump, recently had a meeting with Ramaswamy and his team to discuss the new subcommittee, another source familiar told CNN.
The creation of the new subcommittee establishes a congressional arm to the broader effort by Trump and his allies to make significant cuts to the federal government. The subpanel will examine the salaries and status of members of the federal civil service and intergovernmental personnel among other oversight measures.
“I’m excited to chair this new subcommittee designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy, and the entire DOGE team” Greene said in a statement to CNN. “Our subcommittee’s work will expose people who need to be FIRED. The bureaucrats who don’t do their job, fail audits like in the Pentagon, and don’t know where BILLIONS of dollars are going, will be getting a pink slip.”
Greene said she plans to investigate waste throughout the federal government and hold hearings.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-doge-oversight/index.html
254,General Politics,2024,11,Trump team maps out Latin America strategy as part of mass deportation plan,Priscilla Alvarez,"Washington
CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump’s team is gaming out an aggressive strategy toward Latin America that will be a crucial element to plans to deport migrants at large scale, according to two sources involved in transition policy discussions.
During his first term, Trump took a hardline – and at times, scatter shot – approach toward the region, which was largely the source of migration to the United States, including levying consequences, like sanctions, and threatening and imposing tariffs.
In his second term, the region will continue to play a central role in plans to stem the flow of migration and return people who are undocumented in the US. Deportation often hinges on diplomacy – and has been a steep challenge for the US when dealing with countries where there are frosty relations.
This time around, sources involved and close to the transition said they’re better prepared as they seek ways to engage in a forceful manner and leverage allies, while also floating the possibility of stiff consequences for countries who don’t comply. Taken together, it’s a return to a hardline approach meant to get countries receiving deportees to comply and attempt to curb migration.
“Every tool is in our arsenal. There’s an ever-stream of creativity,” one of the sources said.
The strategy amounts to relying heavily on Mexico, as the US has traditionally done, to control migration to their northern border, bringing back agreements that barred migrants from seeking asylum in the US if they passed through certain countries, and working closely with Panama to stop the flow of migrants through the Darien Gap.
It’s a plan that requires buy-in from regional partners. But sources close to and involved in discussions argue they’ve identified the incentives and pressure points to have countries cooperate.
“Everything is on the table,” the source said, referring to ensuring countries take back their nationals. “Once the president re-establishes credibility and consequences, it’s not something taken lightly.”
In recent years, the Western Hemisphere faced record migration fueled by deteriorating conditions that only worsened during the coronavirus pandemic. That resulted in surges at the US-Mexico border that strained already-overwhelmed federal resources.
The changing demographics arriving at the border has also complicated deportations. For example, poor economic conditions, food shortages and limited access to health care have pushed more than 7.7 million people to flee Venezuela, marking the largest displacement in the Western Hemisphere – and many chose to go north.
Venezuela briefly accepted deportation flights but then stopped.
Trump’s team is prepared to bring back sanctions, which the Biden administration softened to try to stabilize the country, if Venezuela doesn’t comply, sources said, though it’s unclear whether that would move the needle.
“There has been change and turnover on a bilateral basis, but by the end of the first term we were very aware of the incentives and pressure points – that wasn’t something we knew or had a full understanding of coming in. Other governments know our priorities, too – and know we’re serious about this,” said a former official currently involved in the planning.
The Biden administration has secured some breakthroughs, including being able to conduct repatriation flights to China.
Governments in the region have also signaled that they’re keenly aware of the approach Trump is likely to take and preparing as a result.
“They expect he’s going to be fierce and destructive to the region. He’s going to take advantage at every opportunity and leverage opportunities,” according to a source familiar with discussions. “It’s been very matter of fact. Everyone is preparing in a very savvy way for the approaches he’s going to take.”
Trump’s pledge to deport undocumented immigrants, if enacted, could also wreak havoc across the region, where many countries depend on remittances from the US to boost their economies.
The executive actions and reviews underway by the Trump team include the return of the program informally known as “remain in Mexico,” which requires migrants to stay in Mexico during their immigration proceedings in the US.
Shortly after Trump won the presidential election, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she had a “cordial” call with Trump where they discussed the “good relationship” between Mexico and the US, according to a post on X.
Trump’s team is also preparing to launch negotiations to re-implement what was previously known as Asylum Cooperative Agreements, sources said.
The agreements – initiated during Trump’s first term – marked a significant shift in US asylum policy as migrants who may have legitimate claims for asylum could be sent to other countries to make their cases.
The US was in various stages of the agreements with the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, but only the agreement with Guatemala was ever really up and running.
El Salvador is expected to be a key ally in bringing back those agreements, according to one of the sources, who said the governments in Guatemala and Honduras may prove to be a challenge. El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele was among the first leaders to congratulate Trump.
“A second-term Trump administration will expand ‘burden-sharing’ deals with Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that cut off pathways to the US for asylum-seekers. The goal is to expand the reach of those to as many countries, continents, regions as possible,” the former official said.
Biden administration officials also sought to secure commitments from regional partners to curb migration and share migration responsibilities, including through what became known as the Los Angeles declaration, but also faced challenges amid country constraints.
Experts say Trump’s expected approach may also face hurdles.
“It’s a dance,” said Andrew Selee, president of the nonpartisan think tank Migration Policy Institute. “The US holds a lot of cards, but not all of the cards.”

While President Joe Biden bragged about picking the most diverse Cabinet in history, one that he said “looks like America,” President-elect Donald Trump is looking for TV experience.
While Trump’s picks so far mostly lack in racial or gender diversity – there are a handful of women and one Latino, for example, but no Black Americans selected yet – they do reach outside of the normal stable of likely government officials, in keeping with Trump’s goal of shaking up Washington.
It shouldn’t necessarily be a shock from the former president who likes to see attractive people defend him on TV and who became famous in New York tabloids and a reality show. But it’s striking nonetheless to see the number of TV and entertainment personalities Trump is tapping for his second term.
The Cabinet is still taking shape, and key roles like Treasury secretary have not been filled. Plus, not all of his Fox News picks are for Cabinet roles. The latest development is that Trump is reportedly eyeing Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent turned right-wing podcaster who left his job hosting a Fox News show in 2023, as Secret Service director. There are others also in contention for the position.
Read on for more of the striking casting sheet:

The most notable instance of the made-for-TV Cabinet is Trump’s announcement of his choice for defense secretary: Pete Hegseth, a Fox News weekend host with a great physique and hair, whose tattoos drove him from the Army National Guard.
Hegseth has big ideas for how to reform the military, starting with the firing of some generals, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the ending of diversity programs in the military. He also wants women out of combat roles, something that could be contested by Tulsi Gabbard, Trump’s pick for the non-Cabinet role of director of national intelligence, who served in a field medical unit during the US war in Iraq and is still an Army reservist.

Dr. Mehmet Oz, who most people know as Dr. Oz, is a cardiothoracic surgeon who turned guest appearances on Oprah Winfrey’s show into his own daytime career. He left that to run unsuccessfully for Senate in Pennsylvania in 2022. Days before the announcement of his appointment, he was selling vitamin supplements online.
Trump wants Oz to take over the most important agency most Americans may never have heard of: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, which oversees health insurance coverage for more than 160 million Americans.

Mike Huckabee was the governor of Arkansas, a position now held by his daughter, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as Trump’s press secretary during his first term. In between failed bids for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2016, Huckabee hosted a show on Fox News.
More recently, he’s had a show on the Trinity Broadcasting Network, a Christian outlet. He’ll bring an evangelical worldview to Jerusalem, where Trump moved the US embassy, if confirmed as US ambassador to Israel. Trump’s choice is controversial for anyone who envisions a two-state solution in the Middle East, since Huckabee once said there’s “no such thing as a Palestinian.”

Long before Sean Duffy was a congressman from Wisconsin, he was a contestant on MTV’s “The Real World: Boston,” an early part of the reality TV world once also inhabited by Trump.
Duffy met his wife, Rachel Campos-Duffy, on the set of a spinoff, “Road Rules: All Stars.” Now, she’s a co-host on “Fox & Friends Weekend,” where she worked for years with Hegseth. Duffy is leaving his post-Congress role as a co-host on Fox Business now that he’s been tapped by Trump to serve as Transportation secretary, in charge of the nation’s highway and rail systems, airways and seaports.

Gabbard, a former House representative, left the Democratic Party, but along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., she’s one of two former Democratic presidential candidates among Trump’s administration picks. She has appeared hundreds of times on Fox News. More recently, she signed on to do a series of documentary-style videos on Elon Musk’s X.
As Trump’s pick to be director of national intelligence, Gabbard has drawn criticism for her defense of Russia and Syria in the name of her anti-war ideals. Hillary Clinton once said she thought Russians were “grooming” Gabbard to run as a third-party candidate.
A Fox contributor to be ‘border czar’

Tom Homan, the former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, will be in charge of coordinating immigration policy for Trump. By serving as “border czar,” Homan won’t have to face Senate confirmation.
Homan was actually the first of Trump’s picks to be announced from the Fox News orbit. CNN’s Brian Stelter wrote at the time:
While the revolving door between television and government is a bipartisan and often-criticized phenomenon, it never stopped spinning during Trump’s first term in office. Between 2017 and 2020, there were 20 known cases of Fox-to-Trump moves, including Anthony Scaramucci, Richard Grenell, Heather Nauert, Morgan Ortagus, and Bill Shine.

Trump has picked Kennedy to be the next Health and Human Services secretary. There’s been a steep drop in faith among Republicans in particular in the need for vaccines. Say what you want about Kennedy’s interesting-sounding ideas about making American food less processed and healthier. Appreciate the toned body he showed off in shirtless workouts. But it’s impossible to get past the vaccine skeptic part of him that pushes unfounded theories.
He wrote a book full of unfounded conspiracy theories attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci and alleging the country’s former top infectious disease doctor was in league with Bill Gates and pharmaceutical companies to undermine public health. It was a New York Times bestseller. Which, as CNN’s Peter Bergen noted in an interview with Kennedy, totally undermines his claim that he was being silenced – a frequent claim of the stars of anti-mainstream media.

256,General Politics,2024,11,2024 marks a 21st century rarity: Almost everyone thinks the election results are legitimate,Harry Enten,"CNN
 — 
The reaction from Democrats to Donald Trump’s 2024 victory is, to put it mildly, very much unlike their reaction to his 2016 win. Instead of mass protests in the streets, Democrats have been, for the most part, quiet.
Indeed, the aftermath of the 2024 election almost looks like it is from a bygone era. This is the first presidential election in at least a decade when pretty much everyone on the losing side has reached the fifth stage of grief: acceptance.
Take a look at recent polling from Reuters/Ipsos. When asked whether Trump’s win was legitimate, about 94% of voters said it was. This includes 64% who agreed that Trump’s win was legitimate and supported his presidency and another 30% who accepted Trump’s victory but indicated that they would oppose his presidency.
Only about 6% of registered voters said they did not accept the results as legitimate.
Democrats feel basically the same way. About 90% said the results were legitimate, while very few (about 10%) said they were not.
Compare that to where we were four years ago in the aftermath of the 2020 campaign. A Quinnipiac University poll found that 60% of voters said Biden’s win was legitimate while 34% said it wasn’t. Among Republicans, over two-thirds (70%) argued Biden’s victory was illegitimate.
That high percentage of Republicans who thought Biden’s win was illegitimate has pretty much held firm since. Trump, of course, flamed those beliefs by never conceding to Biden and consistently arguing the election was rigged. Trump’s claims were, of course, unfounded.
This year, unlike four years ago, the losing candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, did concede, and the losing side, Biden, welcomed the winning side to the White House.
But what makes what’s happening this year so interesting isn’t just the comparison to 2020 – it’s also the comparison to 2016, when a different Democrat lost to Trump
Back then, Hillary Clinton did concede defeat. President Barack Obama did welcome Trump to the White House.
Yet despite these cues from the top, some Democrats dug in. There was a movement to stop the electors of the Electoral College from voting for Trump. A few Democrats objected to Trump’s certification at Congress – though far fewer than the GOP members of Congress who did the same with Biden four years later.
More notably, there were mass protests in the streets.

This showed in the polling. A third of Clinton supporters in a mid-November 2016 ABC News/Washington Post poll said that Trump’s win was not legitimate. Overall, 18% of adults said Trump’s win wasn’t legitimate, three times as large as the figures for the 2024 election
By April 2017, the percentage of adults who viewed Trump as an illegitimate president rose to 32% in Gallup polling. The percentage of Democrats who felt that way became a majority (56%).
The 2016 election wasn’t the first time Democrats thought a GOP president didn’t legitimately win. After George W. Bush’s razor tight win in 2000 and close victory in 2004, 76% and 25% of Democrats respectively said his victories in those elections were not legitimate in CBS News polling. Over 40% of all Americans agreed that his 2000 win was illegitimate, while a much lower 14% said so about 2004. A number of Democrats in Congress objected to the official certification of both wins.
The response from Democrats in 2024 feels a lot more like something you might have seen from Republicans in 2008 or 2012.
In both those years, no pollster that I could find even asked about whether Obama’s wins were legitimate. It was just taken as a foregone conclusion that most people would say it was.
No congressional Republicans objected to certifying Obama’s win in either 2009 or 2013. Obama’s two wins were the only two times in the 2000s that no one on either side of the aisle objected to a president’s win in Congress.
This isn’t to say there weren’t efforts to delegitimize Obama’s presidency from some Republicans. A number, including Trump, falsely claimed that he was not a natural born citizen and therefore was ineligible to be president.
Yet the percentage of Americans and Republicans who believed Obama was born in another country tended to be quite small.
The question going forward is whether this era of acceptance continues. Recent history suggests that it probably won’t. Democrats may have accepted Trump’s win, but he’s likely to upset them greatly during his presidency.
Then again, we don’t know how Trump’s second term will actually go down. We’re already dealing with a pattern breaking in that Trump is the first president to win non-consecutive terms since the 19th century. Maybe something unusual will happen again.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/politics/2024-results-legitimate-analysis/index.html
257,General Politics,2024,11,Trump’s turn to bask in Musk’s reflected glory,Stephen Collinson,"CNN
 — 
All eyes should have been on the sky over a launchpad in Texas on Tuesday as the world’s largest rocket streaked thunderously toward space.
But the orbit currently getting the most attention is not in the heavens — it’s the increasingly intimate one back on Earth uniting the planet’s soon-to-be-again most powerful man and its richest man.
President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk — after trips to see Republicans in Washington and an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in New York, including a mid-flight McDonald’s with a grimacing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — took to the road again to watch Musk’s SpaceX Starship rocket blast off on its latest test flight.
For once, Trump’s hyperbole wasn’t over the top. “I’m heading to the Great State of Texas to watch the launch of the largest object ever to be elevated, not only to Space, but simply by lifting off the ground,” he wrote on social media.
Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX visionary, has spent the last two weeks basking in Trump’s reflected glory at Mar-a-Lago. He’s around so much it’s almost like he’s family, and he even made it into a photo of Trump’s extended clan. Now, it was time for him to share some of his own aura with his new best friend.
Trump, jaw clenched, eyes narrowed against the glare and sporting a red MAGA hat bearing a “45” and a “47,” struck a Mount Rushmore pose, certainly aware of television split screens that would pair him alongside the rocket’s takeoff burn. He looked almost if he was claiming some of the credit for himself.
In the nervous moments before the launch, various lesser satellites revolved around Trump, including his son Donald Jr., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson, the former White House physician. But the president-elect seemed most animated when Musk appeared and explained what would unfold when the rocket took off.
A bit of a disappointment
In the event, Trump didn’t get to see the ballistic ballet of SpaceX returning its massive booster to be clutched by a state-of-the-art launchpad that he raved about on the campaign trail. “I see that fire pouring out the bottom of the rocket that’s coming in sideways and I say, ‘it’s going to crash into the gantry,’” Trump said earlier this month. “And those two big beautiful arms they grab it — I said, ‘What the hell was that?’”
On Tuesday, mission controllers made a split-second decision instead to ditch the giant Roman candle-like vehicle in the Gulf of Mexico after its slow-motion descent. “Maybe they just want to be careful not to kill the president-elect of the United States by any chance,” Greg Autry, associate provost for space commercialization and strategy at the University of Central Florida, told CNN.
But the stunning spectacle of the Starship roaring off the launchpad and its flight around the globe in a matter of minutes to delicately splash down, feet first, in the Indian Ocean, was testimony to the genius of Musk, who revolutionized the space industry, revived the US-manned spaceflight program, and is on course to return humans to the moon — and eventually Mars.
It explains why Trump wants Musk alongside him. If he can disrupt the aerospace sector, at the same time as reinventing the electric vehicle business, what might Musk do with his new Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump has tapped him and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead? Trump believes he has a mandate to blow up the federal bureaucracy like one of the prototype rockets his new friend used to supercharge progress in his space program.
But the president-elect’s presence at the Starship launch and his anointing of Musk with his approval also point to the huge problem with their tie-up.
The South African-born billionaire now has a massive role in space exploration, US national security and the electric vehicle industry. And Trump can grant Musk extraordinary favors. Musk, armed with the authority of the president in his new role as scourge of government, may even be able to wipe out regulations that hinder his business and profit from tilting the marketplace.
Conflicts of interest weren’t exactly taken seriously in the first Trump administration. But Musk’s ubiquity in Trump 2.0 as the standout ally in an emerging inner circle of billionaires, millionaires and Fox News anchors means they have officially become a joke.

Why Trump likes Musk
It’s not rocket science why Trump likes Musk. He’s dynamic and a certifiable genius. The president-elect also likes the ego boost of being courted by the world’s wealthiest human — especially one who spent millions of dollars to get him elected and turned X into a free-for-all that mirrors Trump’s conspiratorial worldview and has immense power to influence vast numbers of voters.
In many ways, Musk is a far more successful version of Trump himself. He tears things down before building them back up, had multiple marriages and was shaped by a domineering father who left a mark on his psyche. It’s not often that Trump, who seeks to dominate every room and relationship, seems impressed about something other than himself. But his fan boy appreciation for Musk’s rocketry seems perfectly genuine.

Still, it’s about more than money and space dreams.
By palling around with Musk, the 78-year-old Trump secured an entry into a young, male subculture where the Tesla pioneer is seen as an icon. Their friendship also bought Trump credibility among other opinion formers that reach this demographic, which was evident in his appearances on YouTube shows and podcasts with Joe Rogan, the Nelk Boys, Theo Von and Barstool Sports.
All of this helped improve Trump’s standing in the election with young, male voters — a constituency that Democrats are struggling to reach. Trump has rarely seemed as at ease or authentic as he does in these venues, talking with authority about wrestling, football and conspiracy theories. One of the most remarkable moments came on Von’s show when Trump became unusually animated in asking his host about his past cocaine use.
Trump’s growing cultural clout
Trump’s visit to Musk’s launchpad was also the latest occasion since the election when he has inserted himself into high-profile photo-ops. The image reflects the developing reality that Trump, who’s always been an icon in the UFC and reality TV worlds, is indisputably becoming a cultural figure as well as a political one.
The UFC’s smash mouth image explains a lot of Trump’s political style. And now a Trump dance is going viral.
His political opponents saw his strange jiggling on stage at his rallies as a sign of fraying cognitive health. His supporters perceived humor and self-deprecation. Now the president-elect’s two-fisted shimmy is being adopted by athletes in major league sports, who boogie Trump-style to celebrate big-fight wins, touchdowns and goals. This is heady stuff for a Republican Party that has for years struggled to match Democrats when it comes to big-time celebrity support.

But something more sinister is also at play. Trump is sanding down the roughest edges of an extreme image that was cemented by the darkest closing argument of any presidential candidate in modern history.
The president-elect, who dances on state to the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.,” is the same one who promises mass deportations of undocumented migrants, who tried to steal the 2020 election after lying about the result, who is a convicted felon, and who appears set on wielding uncheckable power after January 20. It’s long been a tactic of authoritarians to soften their images with antics and stunts that further their personality cults and disguise their more nefarious goals. Perhaps it’s a coincidence, but North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, at moments when he wants to be seen as the father of the nation, often attends televised rocket launches.
How long can it last?
As well as “Y.M.C.A.,” another one of the MAGA campaign trail soundtrack staples is “Rocket Man” by Elton John, which is about an astronaut “burning out his fuse” Trump-style as he flies alone through space. The hit perhaps reflects Trump’s starry-eyed infatuation with Musk’s amazing array of spaceships and limitless ambition.
But despite their budding friendship, it’s becoming fashionable to speculate when the big Trump-Musk bromance might itself blow up — given that both men are abrasive, need to be the stars in their own firmaments and appear to find close friendships difficult.
With Musk, Trump might get more than he bargained for.
He may not, for instance, be willing pay the political price of mass layoffs among federal workers, loss of productivity and the failure of government programs that Musk might cause with savage cuts recommended by the new DOGE.

And Trump’s recent quips that he can’t get rid of Musk from Mar-a-Lago have been interpreted by some as a sign that his welcome is wearing thin.
“You can only ultimately have one star of the show and that star of the show is going to be Donald Trump,” former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty told CNN’s Erin Burnett on Tuesday. But he also argued that Musk is brilliant, innovative and inventive and was fully on brand for the president-elect. “Trump campaigned on the notion that we are going to break the mold,” he said.
When Trump is inaugurated for a second time as president of the United States, there will be no mistaking who is the senior partner — even if Musk wields vast non-state power through his wealth and business ventures that penetrate deep into the economies of nations all over the world.
Musk is also becoming a force multiplier for Trump — another reason to keep him around. The president-elect put him on a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after the election. (Musk controls the Starlink internet service that is vital to Ukraine’s military in the war with Russia that Trump has pledged to end). And French President Emmanuel Macron, an astute student of the art of Trump flattery, plans to invite the 47th president and Musk to an AI summit in Paris in February.
Trump spent the early months of his first term taunting North Korean leader Kim as “little rocket man” for his proclivity to shoot off missiles every time he believed his pariah state wasn’t getting attention.
The hostility soon wore off and Trump has often talked about how they “fell in love” — although their photo-op summits did little to reverse Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs. It’s too early to say whether the Kim and Trump bromance will resume in the next president’s second term.
And in any case, Trump has got a new rocket man.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/politics/trump-musk-relationship-analysis/index.html
258,General Politics,2024,11,RFK Jr. compared Trump to Hitler and praised descriptions of his supporters as ‘Nazis’,Andrew Kaczynski,"CNN
 — 
Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of Health and Human Services, has a long history of scathing critiques against Trump, labeling him a “threat to democracy,” a “bully,” and, as recently as July, a “terrible president.”
But Kennedy’s harshest attacks date back to Trump’s rise in 2016, when on his radio show “Ring of Fire,” Kennedy applauded descriptions of Trump’s base as “belligerent idiots” and suggestions that some were “outright Nazis” and “spineless fellow travelers.” Kennedy also likened Trump to historical demagogues like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, accusing Trump of exploiting societal insecurities and xenophobia to amass power.
After Trump won in 2016, Kennedy concluded in one episode from December of that year that Trump was at least in one way not like Hitler, because, “Hitler was interested in policy.”
A CNN KFile review of Kennedy’s past comments shows they fit a pattern of consistent, broad-based criticism that Kennedy has leveled at Trump over the years.
In 2019, Kennedy argued that Trump had turned his first administration over to corporate lobbyists from industries they were supposed to regulate— industries that Kennedy would actually be able to regulate in some cases if confirmed as Trump’s HHS secretary.
As the head of HHS, Kennedy would oversee vast swathes of the American food and health care industries. The sprawling federal agency has a mandatory proposed budget exceeding $1.7 trillion and oversees key public health initiatives, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and Medicare and Medicaid, which together impact the lives of all Americans.
In a statement to CNN, Kennedy expressed pride in serving in Trump’s administration, supported Trump’s vision for the country and said he regrets his past comments about the former president.
“Like many Americans, I allowed myself to believe the mainstream media’s distorted, dystopian portrait of President Trump. I no longer hold this belief and now regret having made those statements,” he said.
Comparing Trump to demagogues
Kennedy’s years of criticism toward Trump began to soften after he was shunned by the Democratic Party during the 2024 primary, prompting him to run as an independent.
Asked in August whether he would ever serve in Trump’s cabinet, Kennedy said, “No.” but weeks later, he ended his campaign and endorsed Trump. Kennedy has since refrained from any public criticism of Trump, aligning himself with the former president on issues like government censorship and public health.

But the newly uncovered comments from Kennedy’s radio show underscore the intensity of his past rebukes of Trump, including having leveled charges of racism toward him.
Kennedy repeatedly accused Trump of exploiting fear, bigotry and xenophobia to build a “dangerous” nationalist movement and warned Trump would destroy both the climate and clean water. Kennedy also compared Trump’s supporters to white Americans in the 1970s who, he said, viewed the Civil Rights Movement as a “social demotion.”
In one episode of “Ring of Fire” from December 2016, Kennedy compared Trump’s strategy to historical demagogues who rose during times of crisis.
Drawing comparisons to global crises such as the Great Depression, Kennedy said periods of economic and social instability had often given rise to demagogues who exploit fear, prejudice and insecurity to gain power. He cited figures abroad like Hitler, Francisco Franco and Mussolini, as well as Huey Long and Father Coughlin in the US, as historical parallels.
“And you can see that every statement that Donald Trump makes is fear-based,” Kennedy said on his radio show in December 2016. “Every statement he makes. You know, we have to be fear of the Muslims. We have to be fear of the black people, and particularly the big Black guy Obama, who’s destroying this country, who’s making everybody miserable.”
“And only one person has the genius and the capacity to solve these things. And I’m not gonna tell you how I’m gonna do it. Just trust in me, vote for me and everything will be great again. And of course, that whole thing is like a carnival barker,” Kennedy concluded.
He also compared Trump’s appeal to that of famous segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
“Wallace’s appeal … was to White middle-class men who had experienced the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s as a social demotion, and who found their lives in turmoil,” Kennedy said. “And that kind of insecurity, I think, is the target of the summons that Donald Trump has sent out to the American public.”
‘Belligerent idiots’ and ‘Outright Nazis’
In March 2016, Kennedy praised journalist Matt Taibbi’s critique of Trump’s base, reading on-air a passage that harshly condemned Trump and his followers which he called “beautifully” written.
“One of the things that you write so beautifully, and your stuff is so fun to read, but you write about Trump, quote, ‘The way that you build a truly vicious nationalist movement is to wed a relatively small core of belligerent idiots to a much larger group of opportunists and spineless fellow travelers whose primary function is to turn a blind eye to things,’” Kennedy said, reading Taibbi’s own writing back to him.
“‘We may not have that many outright Nazis in America, but we have plenty of cowards and bootlickers, and once those fleshy dominoes start tumbling into the Trump camp, the game is up,’” Kennedy said in finishing the passage Taibbi wrote.
“And, you know, he’s not like Hitler,” Kennedy said. “Hitler had like a plan, you know, Hitler was interested in policy,” Kennedy went on. “I don’t think Trump has any of that. He’s like non compos mentis. He’ll get in there and who knows what will happen.”
Attacked Trump’s views on the environment
Kennedy on his radio show also harshly criticized Trump’s environmental policies, accusing him of promoting reckless climate denialism and prioritizing corporate interests over public health.
On one episode of “Ring of Fire” in December 2016, Kennedy referenced an article by climate scientist Michael Mann and said, “Michael Mann did a great article this week about the 10 worst climate deniers in the world, the most damaging, most destructive. And Donald Trump is number one.”
He accused Trump of pursuing “pollution-based prosperity” by rolling back regulations like the Clean Water Act and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Agreement.

“Trump isn’t just gonna destroy the climate, but he’s also promised last week when he spoke to the oil industry, the shale gas industry, he promised that he would get rid of the Clean Water Act,” he added. “So he’s just gonna open the floodgates to every kind of pollution … Trump’s prosperity is gonna be pollution-based prosperity.”
Kennedy’s sharp criticisms of Trump extended into 2019, when he compared Trump’s EPA chief Andrew Wheeler to one of the “Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse” and called Trump’s efforts to boost fossil fuel production “despicable,” accusing him of knowingly prioritizing coal, oil and gas over the planet’s future.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/kfile-rfk-jr-trump-critique/index.html

 — 
Donald Trump’s return to power is creating a reality television-like competition for attention among a group of black-robed candidates – some of whom may hope to one day wind up on the Supreme Court.
Several possible contenders for one of the coveted nine seats on the high court have been burnishing their conservative bona fides in public statements, combative court opinions and public champagne toasts – an effort that could prove useful if an opening materializes during Trump’s second term in office.
For a president-elect who has named provocative “fighters” to Cabinet positions, appearing as an outspoken and punchy jurist is likely smart strategy, even though some of Trump’s critics see it as an “unseemly” auditioning that breaks with tradition, especially without an actual vacancy to fill.

Trump’s election sparks speculation and infighting over future Supreme Court vacancies
US Circuit Judge Andrew Oldham drew attention recently for condemning “political” prosecutions days after Trump’s reelection. Oldham did not mention Trump by name – nor special counsel Jack Smith’s criminal cases against him – but the context of the remarks was hard to miss.
“One thing that is beyond reasonable debate is that people should not be prosecuted on the basis of their politics or on their status as a political candidate,” Oldham declared at a convention of lawyers in Washington, DC, organized by the conservative Federalist Society.
Oldham, who Trump named to the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018, slammed “prosecutions lodged in the middle of political campaigns” and told the conference that opposing such efforts demanded “rock-ribbed defense.”
Early jockeying underscores the potential significance of a second Trump term on the federal judiciary, and the Supreme Court specifically. If Trump is able to name one or two younger justices in a second term, it would lock in for decades the conservative supermajority he built in his first term.
“Some of the judges Trump put on the courts of appeals … have been openly campaigning for the Supreme Court,” said Jake Faleschini, justice program director at the liberal Alliance for Justice.
“This is not the sort of thing we’ve seen consistently in the past,” Faleschini said, noting that past potential candidates sought to limit public stances to avoid giving critics something to use against them at confirmation hearings. “We’re in a different world.”
At the same Federalist Society convention where Oldham spoke earlier this month, US Circuit Judge Neomi Rao raised a glass of champagne along with others on her panel to celebrate the Supreme Court’s rulings earlier this year weakening the power of federal agencies.
Days earlier, US Circuit Judge James Ho – another Trump 5th Circuit appointee – appeared to qualify his position defending birthright citizenship – a subtle turn that brought him more in line with Trump’s own views on that issue. In an interview with a conservative law professor, Ho said the citizenship principle doesn’t apply in cases of “war” or “invasion.”
“Birthright citizenship obviously doesn’t apply in case of war or invasion,” Ho told the professor. “No one to my knowledge has ever argued that the children of invading aliens are entitled to birthright citizenship.”
Ho – who was an outspoken jurist long before Trump’s reelection – framed his remarks as consistent with his past positions. In an opinion this summer dealing with Texas’ construction of a floating barrier on the Rio Grande, Ho wrote that Texas should have prevailed in the case because the state was repelling an “invasion” of migrants.
“A sovereign isn’t a sovereign if it can’t defend itself against invasion,” he wrote.
Ho, Oldham and Rao are all in their late 40s to early 50s, meaning they could serve as justices for decades if chosen and confirmed.
After naming three justices to the Supreme Court – Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – it’s not clear if Trump will have more opportunities to shape the bench in a second term.
Retirement speculation has centered on two of the court’s stalwart and veteran conservatives, Justice Clarence Thomas, 76, and Justice Samuel Alito, 74. People close to Alito recently told the Wall Street Journal he has no plans to step down.
Multiple sources told CNN that Trump’s transition is not actively vetting candidates for the Supreme Court, though they stressed that could change quickly.
CNN has reached out to Oldham, Ho and Thapar for comment. A source close to Ho pushed back on the notion that the judge is gunning for a Supreme Court nomination, telling CNN that the judge may not want to move his family to the nation’s capital.
Culture war judges
If Trump’s Cabinet picks are any indication, he may be looking for judicial candidates who are strident conservatives – more in line with Thomas and Alito than his own first-term nominees.
Trump is “going to be looking for what I think some people call fearless judges – those who are not afraid to stake out their position and defend it and in theory take the criticism,” said John P. Collins Jr., a professor at the George Washington University Law School.
“Trump’s picks during his first term all fit the mold of establishment legal conservatives,” Collins said. “Now, they’re looking for more culture war-type conservatives.”
Hiram Sasser, executive general counsel at the conservative First Liberty Institute, pushed back on the notion that the judges themselves are seeking to gain Trump’s attention. Instead, he said, influential judicial conservatives are likely being asked to appear more on podcasts and in forums rather than seeking the attention themselves.
“People want to hear from the most productive and influential voices in all professions,” Sasser said. “I predict that based on past statements from President Trump, he is looking for judicial courage – someone who applies the law and even though the New York Times comes after them, that judge gets up the next morning and does it again, and again, and again. I doubt he or his team are looking for a schmoozer.”
If the judges are engaged in a hand-raising effort, then there are signs it has paid off in the past.
Then-Judge Gorsuch drew considerable attention in 2016 by writing a concurring opinion to his own majority opinion on the 10th Circuit in which he eviscerated the notion of giving federal agencies deference to approve regulations in the face of vague laws. The view aligned neatly with Trump’s own position on limiting the power and size of government.
“There’s an elephant in the room with us today,” Gorsuch wrote of so-called Chevron deference months before the 2016 election. “Maybe the time has come to face the behemoth.”
The Supreme Court ultimately overturned Chevron deference – with Gorsuch in the majority – in a blockbuster decision earlier this year, leading to the Federalist Society toast.
Another jurist often mentioned as a possible Supreme Court candidate, US Circuit Judge Amul Thapar, recently used a Heritage Foundation event to rail against law schools for not teaching originalism, a legal doctrine favored by the conservative justices to decide everything from abortion to gun cases.
Thapar, who Trump named to the 6th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017, called American law schools “amiss” and accused them of “malpractice” for not more forcefully embracing the conservative doctrine, which relies on defining the words of the Constitution as the framers would have understood them. Thapar, 55, said that universities that failed on that front should face consequences in their funding.
“If that is not their priority, then taxpayers should take note and demand change,” Thapar said. “Every one of us, including the taxpayers, should be demanding that law schools hire professors who are committed to educating people about what the Constitution means, not what the professors wish it meant.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/supreme-court-jockeying-donald-trump/index.html
260,General Politics,2024,11,Trump’s pick for intel chief has deeply rooted distrust of agencies she would oversee,Katie Bo Lillis,"CNN
 — 
In 2020, the woman who has become Donald Trump’s pick to be the nation’s top spymaster met with one of the most infamous leakers of all time.
Tulsi Gabbard, then in the midst of a failed bid for the Democratic nomination for president, met with Daniel Ellsberg, a military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers to The New York Times and The Washington Post in the 1970s and was charged with violations of the Espionage Act. He argued to her that it should be unconstitutional to charge officials who leak classified information to media outlets with espionage.
Gabbard agreed, declaring the practice “insanity.” Later that year, she introduced a bill in the House called the “Protect Brave Whistleblowers Act,” designed to shield people like Ellsberg. She wrote two more bills that same week supporting Julian Assange and Edward Snowden, who were behind two of the biggest US national security leaks of the 21st Century.
Trump’s selection of Gabbard to run the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has quickly drawn scrutiny because of her relative inexperience in the intelligence community and her public adoption of positions on Syria and the war in Ukraine that many national security officials see as Russian propaganda.
But where she is perhaps most at odds with the agencies she may soon be tasked with leading is her distrust of broad government surveillance authorities and her support for those willing to expose some of the intelligence community’s most sensitive secrets.
It’s also where she may come into conflict with Trump’s own past record — even as she appears to represent an evolution of the MAGA movement toward a more youthful, techno-libertarian vision of the anti-surveillance faction of the Republican Party. It was the first Trump administration, after all, that in 2019 took the unprecedented step of charging Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, with Espionage Act violations for soliciting and publishing classified information.
“Tulsi Gabbard is a highly unusual pick for Director of National Intelligence in an administration that has nominated some very solid people, like Marco Rubio, Elise Stefanik and Mike Waltz, because she’s somebody who clearly thinks that Edward Snowden should get away scot-free from stealing classified information,” said Jamil Jaffer, a former George W. Bush administration associate White House counsel and founder and executive director of the National Security Institute at George Mason University’s law school.
Gabbard has fiercely defended Assange, introducing a bill in 2020 opposing his extradition and prosecution. And her legislation defending Snowden, the contractor who in 2013 revealed the existence of the bulk collection of American phone records by the National Security Agency before fleeing to Russia, called on the federal government to drop all charges.
Both men are broadly seen as enemies of the state within the intelligence community. And the information they have exposed, officials say, has done grievous harm to America’s ability to collect and protect intelligence.
But both are also causes that have drawn a curious cross-section of political support, from the far left — Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has also opposed the extradition of Assange — to the libertarian-leaning right that contains both Trump allies like Sen. Rand Paul as well as critics such as former Rep. Justin Amash. Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump’s pick to be attorney general, was one of two lawmakers to co-sponsor of Gabbard’s Snowden legislation.
It’s an unusual coalition that long predates — and in some ways exists outside of — Trump’s own deep skepticism of the “deep state” intelligence community, fueled by his claims that the FBI and other intelligence agencies illegally surveilled him as part of a political witch hunt.
Since arriving in Washington roughly a dozen years ago, Gabbard has evolved from a Democratic congresswoman who ran for president in 2020 to a Trump-endorsing Fox News regular who defected to the Republican Party earlier this year.

Interviews with former lawmakers and congressional aides who served with Gabbard as well as a reading of her 2024 memoir highlight a political chameleon who has maintained a populist and isolationist worldview, a willingness to buck party orthodoxy and a tendency to distrust authority figures that her critics say veers into outright conspiracy theory.
“People have core values and beliefs, and Tulsi, I believe, kind of lacks that,” said one Democrat who was close to Gabbard while they were in Congress together.
Gabbard did not respond to CNN’s request for an interview. Trump in a statement announcing her selection said Gabbard would bring a “fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength.”
Gabbard proposed repealing Patriot Act
If confirmed, Gabbard will be the most markedly anti-surveillance official to lead the intelligence community in the post-9/11 era. Her animus towards what she has described as the “national security state and its warmongering friends,” hellbent on using the Espionage Act and other tools to punish its enemies, raises questions about whether she might seek to reshape the rules by which American intelligence agencies have been collecting, searching and using intelligence for decades.
In December 2020, shortly before she left Congress, Gabbard introduced legislation that would repeal the Patriot Act and Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, two of the most significant surveillance authorities passed by Congress after September 11, 2001. Like her other legislative attempts on spying issues, it went nowhere.

The DNI’s primary responsibility — beyond his or her role in determining what intelligence the president sees every day in his daily brief — is over the budget and priorities of the 18 agencies that make up the intelligence community. Because of that, it would be a complicated and difficult — though not impossible — task for Gabbard to unilaterally dismantle intelligence collection under Section 702.
In theory, Gabbard could issue an order to the intelligence community not to use 702 at all, but the Defense Department and Congress would likely push back on that, said Glenn Gerstell, former general counsel at the National Security Agency.
Getting rid of Section 702 entirely would address Gabbard’s concern — shared by civil liberties advocates in both parties — that the law offers too many ways for the intelligence community to surveil Americans without a warrant. But it would also dramatically curtail America’s ability to spy on foreign adversaries overseas, Gerstell said.
“If you were to eliminate just that one statute, you could take about 60% or 70% of the pages of (the president’s daily brief) and just throw it out before it even gets to the commander in chief,” Gerstell said. “And I can’t imagine why any commander in chief would want to operate in this world blindfolded.”
Fighting against a ‘cabal of warmongers’
As both a Democrat and a Republican, Gabbard has espoused a firmly isolationist, anti-war ideology — an organizing principle that fit her identity both as an up-and-coming progressive star and then, later, an adherent to Trump’s “America First” policy.
She’s supported a hawkish foreign policy toward Islamist terrorist groups but has been notably anti-war toward US adversaries like Russia and Syria, along with her distrust of the US intelligence community’s spying apparatus.
At least part of that fiercely doveish foreign policy appears to be driven by a longstanding conviction that the US is standing on the brink of nuclear war with Russia or China. In 2018, Hawaii residents received an accidentally sent alert on their phones warning of an incoming ballistic missile attack. The warning stemmed from a miscommunication during a state drill, not any action by an American adversary. But for Gabbard, the incident was a “wake-up call” that “the threat of nuclear war was and is real and is even greater today,” she wrote in her memoir.
A consistent theme in Gabbard’s book is that the “Democrat elite and neocons” have formed a “cabal of warmongers in permanent Washington.”
“Politicians have plans in place to protect themselves so they can continue to wage a nuclear war from underground in the event of such an attack,” she wrote.
Those same “warmongers in Washington from both political parties… lie to us about the consequences of their warmongering and where it could lead.”
Current and former intelligence officials say they’re particularly concerned by what they see as an unnerving worldview that appears to give precedence to the views of foreign dictators over American leaders.
In early 2022, Gabbard endorsed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s rationale for the invasion of Ukraine, pinning the blame not on Moscow but on the Biden administration’s failure to acknowledge “Russia’s legitimate security concerns regarding Ukraine’s becoming a member of NATO.”
She also repeated a debunked Russian conspiracy theory about supposed American biolabs in Ukraine developing deadly pathogens.

Her public remarks have drawn attention in Russia, where panelists on a Russian state media television show cynically asked if she was a Kremlin state agent. “Yes!” the host said, without evidence.
Some prominent Republicans like former Trump national security adviser John Bolton and former Trump UN ambassador and 2024 GOP presidential candidate Nikki Haley have come out against her.
“This is not a place for a Russian, Iranian, Syrian, Chinese sympathizer. DNI has to analyze real threats,” Haley said Wednesday on her weekly radio program. “Are we comfortable with someone like that at the top of our national intelligence agencies?”
Gabbard has shown no compunction about courting controversy over her foreign policy ideas — and the uproar over her empathetic posture towards Russia appeared not only to sharpen her turn to the right but harden her suspicions of the intelligence community.
In 2020, former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton suggested, without evidence, that Russia was “grooming” Gabbard — an accusation that appeared to profoundly offend Gabbard and give her a deep empathy for Trump. In her 2024 memoir, she wrote that Democrats had “invented a conspiracy theory that (Trump) was ‘colluding’ with the Russians to win the election. Hillary Clinton used a similar tactic against me.”
A meeting with Assad that ‘blindsided’ Democrats
Before coming to Washington, Gabbard joined in the Hawaii National Guard and deployed to Iraq in 2004. Her experience during the Iraq War appeared to shape her populist, anti-interventionist worldview in ways that would often put her at odds with the Obama administration — and showcase her willingness to defy her party.
Gabbard was elected to Congress at age 31. She found a natural place on the House Armed Services Committee both as a veteran and a lawmaker representing Hawaii, a state with a significant military presence.

Lawmakers and congressional aides who served with Gabbard on the committee told CNN Gabbard quickly became a “reliable foil” for Democrats on the committee. She was particularly focused on stopping the war in Syria and opposed the Obama administration’s strategy of backing rebel groups against Syrian President al-Bashar Assad. She also opposed US military strikes in in 2014 after ISIS took over large swaths of Syrian territory.
“She was playing on her own team,” said one former committee aide.
In January 2017, Gabbard planned a trip to Lebanon and Syria sponsored by an Ohio-based Arab American economic group. Her original itinerary filed with the House Ethics Committee did not include any meetings with Assad.
But Gabbard met Assad twice during her four days in Syria, according to travel documents she filed with the House after her trip.
Her trip and meetings caught Democrats in Congress completely by surprise, former aides and lawmakers said, as she didn’t inform committee leaders or then-House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Former aides said Gabbard’s colleagues were “stunned” and “blindsided” that she would meet with an adversary of the US.
When she returned, Gabbard said in an interview with CNN that she met with Assad because “there has to be a conversation with him” for any viable peace agreement.
“When the opportunity arose to meet with him, I did so because I felt that it’s important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we’ve got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we can achieve peace,” she said.
Three months later, Gabbard opposed Trump’s military strikes in Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack. She also criticized Trump’s 2020 killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, saying after an intelligence briefing that there was “no justification whatsoever for this illegal and unconstitutional act of war that President Trump took.”
‘Accountable to no one’
Gabbard left Congress in January 2021, after not running for reelection while she mounted a longshot Democratic presidential campaign that focused on her anti-war views.
In October 2022, she announced that she was leaving the Democratic Party altogether. By October 2024, Gabbard had endorsed Trump, joined his transition team and officially switched parties.

Gabbard is in many ways a stranger to the intelligence community. Multiple current and former career officials who spoke to CNN were alarmed by some of her more controversial public statements but knew little about her beyond the headlines. As a member of Congress, Gabbard served on the House Armed Services Committee, but has had no formal oversight or work with the community she may be tasked with leading.
Lawmakers who served alongside Gabbard in Congress say that it was often a challenge to figure out where she stood ideologically.
But Gabbard’s disdain for government surveillance powers — and her aggrieved sense that Americans have been lied to about those authorities — are among her most coherent and consistent national security positions, even as Gabbard has transformed from a Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate to a potential Cabinet member in the new Trump administration.
In 2017, when Trump was challenging the credibility of the FBI’s investigation into his campaign’s ties to Russia, Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer warned him: “You take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.”
Gabbard, then a Democrat, heard a “chilling message,” she wrote in her memoir: “The intelligence community and national security state are so supremely powerful and accountable to no one that even the president of the United States better not dare criticize them.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/21/politics/tulsi-gabbard-director-national-intelligence-distrust/index.html
261,General Politics,2024,11,Three undecided House races will determine size of GOP’s narrow majority,Eric Bradner,"CNN
 — 
Nick Begich’s flip of Alaska’s lone House seat will pad Republicans’ slim House majority — but with several members departing to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration and just three races left to be decided, the party could enter the new year with very little room for error.
That narrow majority could shape a great deal on Capitol Hill — from how House Speaker Mike Johnson handles a looming government funding fight and unhappiness from his right flank, to who governors consider appointing to fill Senate vacancies — when the new Congress is sworn in on January 3 and Trump takes office 17 days later.
Two weeks post-Election Day, both parties are closely watching a handful of House races in which a winner had not yet been decided. On Wednesday, winners emerged in two of those races: Begich ousted Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola as Alaska tallied its ranked-choice ballots late Wednesday. And, hours earlier, final vote tallies in Ohio padded Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur’s narrow edge in the Toledo-based 9th District.
Those outcomes mean Republicans have won 219 House seats to Democrats’ 213, according to CNN’s projections. The undecided races are California’s 13th and 45th districts, where ballots are still being counted, and Iowa’s 1st District, where GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks leads by about 800 votes ahead of a recount.
However, Trump is poaching the Republicans who hold — or until recently held — three of those seats, to join his still-forming administration. The president-elect could select more GOP House members as he fills out the remainder of his Cabinet and other administration positions.
So far, he has tapped Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, Florida Rep. Michael Waltz as his national security adviser and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as his nominee for US ambassador to the United Nations. Gaetz immediately resigned his House seat and said he wouldn’t take his seat in January. Waltz and Stefanik remain House members for now.
Their seats, which are all expected to remain in Republican hands, will be filled via special elections — but when those elections will take place, and when the winners will be seated in Congress, is not yet clear.
The thin House Republican majority could further shape Capitol Hill, as governors look to fill Senate seats such as that of Vice President-elect JD Vance, who was two years into his term in Ohio, and Florida’s Marco Rubio, Trump’s nominee for secretary of state.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is weighing up to a half-dozen Republican contenders to fill Vance’s seat, officials say, but is in no rush to make an announcement about the appointment before January. A handful of Ohio members of Congress have expressed interest in the Senate post, officials say, but the narrow Republican majority could complicate elevating a House member to the Senate.
Vance has yet to decide when he will formally step down from his seat, officials say, but it’s likely to be closer to the date of the January 20 inauguration. If he decides to do so sooner, DeWine could adjust his timing.
Here’s a look at the three races in which CNN has not yet projected a winner:
Iowa’s 1st District
Miller-Meeks — the winner of 2020’s closest race, notching a six-vote victory before redistricting shifted Iowa’s congressional boundaries — leads Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan by about 800 votes in southeast Iowa’s 1st District, which stretches from counties near Des Moines east to the Mississippi River and includes Davenport, Iowa City and Burlington.
Miller-Meeks has already declared victory, but Bohannan’s campaign requested a recount, which is funded by the state in races decided by less than a percentage point. That recount began Wednesday.
The race was a rematch of Miller-Meeks’ 2022 win over Bohannan, a former state House member. Miller-Meeks, an ophthalmologist and Army veteran, was first elected to Congress in 2020 after three failed House runs, and a brief tenure in the state Senate.
California’s 13th District
Republican Rep. John Duarte holds a narrow edge against Democratic challenger Adam Gray in another rematch of a 2022 race — this one in California’s 13th District, based in the San Joaquin Valley.
As of Wednesday afternoon, Duarte led Gray by just 227 votes out of more than 201,000 cast, a margin that has narrowed significantly as more votes have been counted.
The district is one of the nation’s most competitive. Duarte, a pistachio farmer, is wrapping up his freshman term in Congress. He defeated Gray, a four-term state assemblyman, by four-tenths of a percentage point in a 2022 race that wasn’t decided until early December.
California is notoriously slow to count ballots. The state has universal mail-in voting, and votes are counted as long as they arrive at county elections offices no later than seven days after Election Day. Those ballot envelopes then have to be processed, and signatures verified, further slowing the process.
California’s 45th District
In California’s 45th District, a predominantly Asian American district in Orange County, Democratic challenger Derek Tran leads Republican Rep. Michelle Steel by 314 votes in another knife’s-edge California congressional battle.
Steel made history in 2020 as one of three Korean American women elected to the House. Tran, a lawyer and Army veteran who is Vietnamese American, is a first-time candidate who is vying to represent a district that includes Little Saigon.

 — 
After rarely being seen in public in the two weeks since he delivered a brief, 46-second victory speech on election night, JD Vance reemerged this week to play one of the most important roles he will be expected to fill as Donald Trump’s No. 2: His point person on Capitol Hill.
The first-term Ohio senator has been tasked by the president-elect to help oversee his policy priorities and ensure lawmakers don’t stand in the way of enacting his agenda, multiple sources familiar with the discussions told CNN. That includes a concerted push to shore up support for Trump’s Cabinet picks, starting with two of the most controversial, both of whom face allegations of sexual misconduct that they deny.

Republicans on ethics panel vote to block Gaetz report
On Wednesday, Vance brought former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump’s choice for attorney general, to the Hill to meet with the senators who will be crucial during his confirmation process. And on Thursday, he’ll do the same for former Fox News host Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick to run the Department of Defense.
The effort marks an early test of Vance’s influence in the Senate, a body he joined less than two years ago. His ability to help secure the confirmation of Trump’s Cabinet choices, especially the most unorthodox ones, will be a key measure of the vice president-elect’s political acumen and sway.
Congressional Republicans acknowledge that Vance hasn’t necessarily developed longstanding relationships on Capitol Hill during his abbreviated time in Washington.
“He doesn’t have long relationships. But we all like people who have done what we’ve done. There’s sort of a natural kinship, just not as long,” said North Dakota Sen. Kevin Cramer.
But some Republicans also built pipelines directly to Trump from his first term in the Oval Office and may choose to go directly to the president-elect.
“When I call the White House, if I left a message for five people who work there, the one most likely to call me back – and the one that will do it first — is Donald Trump,” Cramer added, noting that “as a team, they will be very good. And they will divide and conquer. They’ll divide names up, you know, who has the most persuasion.”
Vance set the tone for his return to the Hill with a public message aimed at his GOP colleagues.
“Donald J. Trump just won a major electoral victory. His coattails turned a 49-51 senate to a 53-47 senate,” Vance wrote on X on Wednesday. “He deserves a cabinet that is loyal to the agenda he was elected to implement.”

Absences by Trump’s Senate pals help Democrats confirm Biden judges
The quip served as a reminder for senators who will soon have to vote on Trump’s Cabinet picks. Vance also issued a colorful broadside the previous day, following online criticism of his absence during a Senate vote for one of President Joe Biden’s judicial nominations. Responding to Grace Chong, a staffer for Trump ally Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, who had urged him and other GOP senators expected to serve in Trump’s second term to “do your fricking job,” Vance fired back, calling her a “mouth-breathing imbecile.” Both Chong and Vance have since deleted their posts.
Vance defended his absence by arguing that his vote wasn’t crucial given Democrats’ current majority in the Senate and noted he was instead meeting with Trump and potential candidates to run the FBI, even though the current director is still in the middle of a 10-year term.
Not long after the exchange, Trump, too, urged GOP senators to block further judicial confirmations.
“Republican Senators need to Show Up and Hold the Line,” Trump wrote on social media. “No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!”
Vance’s transition involvement
The vice president-elect, who has met with Trump most days since Election Day, has been closely involved in his top Cabinet picks, including weighing in on the selection of Trump’s former acting ICE director, Tom Homan to serve as the administration’s ‘border czar’ as well as former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to be director of national intelligence, multiple sources close to Trump and Vance told CNN.
Vance has spent the majority of his time since the election at Mar-a-Lago as part of a small group of Trump officials and allies, which includes Elon Musk and Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who have sat in on nearly every key transition meeting. The three developed a bond that predates the campaign and has carried into the early days of Trump’s transition.
The Ohio senator has disappeared from the airwaves amid the busy transition — a stark departure from the cable media appearances he maintained during the campaign.
The expectation is that Vance will “once against be a constant presence on TV and leading defender of Trump” as the transition slows and Inauguration Day approaches, a person close to him said.
One Trump adviser noted that one of the president-elect’s key priorities — which he has made clear in the decisions he has made for other top Cabinet roles — is to ensure Vance is consistently defending him and his policies on television.
“Obviously President Trump is the best champion of his agenda. But when you look at the effectiveness of JD in the campaign, there’s no better surrogate for President Trump’s agenda,” the adviser said.
As Trump continues to build out his Cabinet and top roles for his second term, arming his picks with agendas to carry out on his behalf, it remains unclear what portfolio will occupy Vance’s time.
This decision carries weighty implications that may ripple far beyond the next four years, particularly for a 40-year-old who’s increasingly seen as a leading heir to Trump’s MAGA movement. Over the past four months, Trump and Vance sharply criticized Vice President Kamala Harris’ handling of one of her key assignments — tackling the root causes of illegal immigration from Central America — pinning the blame for the surge in border crossings squarely on her stewardship.
Multiple people close to Trump and Vance maintained it is too early for the transition team to begin having discussions about what his priorities will be, but insisted Vance will take his cues directly from Trump.
However, Vance has publicly and privately acknowledged the issues he cares most about — particularly the ones he clamored to be a leading voice on during his short time in the Senate.
“In JD’s view, his role of VP is to take on any issue that President Trump would like him to take on,” the person close to Vance told CNN. “With that said, it’s no secret that JD strongly cares about issues immigration, tech, and the economy.”
Vance is also waiting for Trump to build out his White House team before announcing staff hires for his office. One of his top aides, deputy chief of staff James Braid, was tapped by Trump to serve as the White House director of legislative affairs, making one of Vance’s key allies his liaison to Capitol Hill.
Together, the two are assigned to push Trump’s agenda through Congress and lobby members to carry out what Trump has repeatedly referred to behind closed doors as the mandate voters have given him.
“Vance is integral to a process that already includes the Hill and probably will continue. There’s a big slate of nominees, and then there’s going to be a big agenda,” a senior Trump adviser told CNN. “That is the president delivering on the promises that represent the platform that we got an overwhelming mandate to apply. That is going to involve Capitol Hill, and for all those reasons, you’ll see JD as part of that.”

263,General Politics,2024,11,Republicans on ethics panel vote to block Gaetz report,Sarah Ferris,"CNN
 — 
Republicans on the House Ethics Committee fell in line behind GOP leaders and voted not to release the results of their investigation into Donald Trump’s attorney general pick, Matt Gaetz, despite growing calls from the Senate GOP to make the findings public ahead of his confirmation hearing.
The GOP’s decision to block the findings — against the will of Democrats on the panel — raises major questions about what happens to the highly secretive information that the ethics panel has already collected on Gaetz.
The committee did vote to meet again in December, when Republicans on the panel hope to have a finalized report, according to two people familiar with the discussions. But until then, pressure is ratcheting up across the Capitol to release the contents of the report as Gaetz makes his case directly to GOP senators who will determine his future as attorney general. And with just weeks left to go in the current Congress, Democrats must now plot their next steps.
Some Democrats are trying to create his own pressure point: Democratic Rep. Sean Casten, who is close to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, announced Wednesday that he would offer a privileged resolution to attempt to make the report public. Before he could, another Democrat, Rep. Steve Cohen, made a similar effort to pry loose the report through a floor vote.
Any House member can file a privileged resolution to force the ethics report to be released by saying it’s relevant to the “dignity and integrity” of the House – which gives the measure special powers to be considered. But it must still pass strict procedural rules to reach the floor.
If Cohen’s or Casten’s resolutions pass those procedural standards, then Speaker Mike Johnson will be forced to bring it to the floor within two legislative days. Privately, though, Democrats believe the GOP will block the measure from actually receiving a vote.
GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who has a fraught relationship with Gaetz, said he would vote to release the report. It’s unclear if Democrats could get the 218 votes needed to release it, but Van Orden’s support shows how Gaetz’s turbulent relationship with his colleagues may come back to haunt him.
“I think it’s very important that everybody has as much knowledge as possible so that they can make an informed decision,” Van Orden said.
The Wisconsin Republican said his “personal feelings about Mr. Gaetz should have nothing to do with what’s going on here in the country, and that’s a big problem in our country, is that people are allowing interpersonal conflicts to affect their ability to legislate.”
Republicans could only afford to lose three GOP votes on a party-line vote, assuming all members are in attendance and voting.
In the meantime, the Ethics Committee will continue to work on its report, which the panel’s chairman, Rep. Michael Guest, has said isn’t complete. The status of the report was a major point of discussion in the two-hour meeting of the panel. While the investigation is complete, lawmakers of both parties have sparred over whether it is technically complete.
A majority of committee members agreed to have the report finalized by the panel’s next meeting on December 5, according to a source familiar, as some committee Republicans joined with Democrats on this vote.
However, committee Republicans voted against an effort to have the report both finalized and released on December 5, the source said. This means that members will be voting on whether to release the final report at their next meeting.
Rep. Susan Wild, the top Democrat on the committee, stressed that her party did not agree with Republicans’ decision not to release the report.
Guest said after the meeting that there was “not an agreement” on whether to disclose the findings.
Shortly after Guest’s comments, Wild spoke to reporters and said: “I do not want the American public or anyone else to think Mr. Guests’ characterization of what transpired today would be some sort of indication that the committee had unanimity or consensus on this issue not to release the report.”
“It comes to my attention that the Chairman has since betrayed the process by disclosing our deliberations within moments of walking out of the committee. He has implied that there was an agreement of the committee not to disclose the report. That is an untrue,” Wild said.
The Pennsylvania Democrat added that the panel will reconvene on December 5 to “to further consider this matter.”
Meanwhile, Republican Sen. John Cornyn — who has said he’d like to see the ethics panel’s report — said he told Gaetz when they met earlier Wednesday that “there are not going to be any secrets here.”
“Everything’s eventually going to come out,” said Cornyn, a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will oversee Gaetz’s confirmation process next year.

264,General Politics,2024,11,Senate defeats effort led by Bernie Sanders to block planned US arms sales to Israel,Clare Foran,"CNN
 — 
The Senate on Wednesday voted down an effort led by Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders to block a series of planned US weapons sales to Israel.
The failure of the long-shot effort highlights that despite criticism from the left that the Biden administration and Israel are not doing enough to protect civilians in Gaza, there remains widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for US military assistance to Israel.
The Senate votes come as scrutiny over US support for Israel’s war against Hamas has intensified as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza has grown worse amid Israel’s ongoing military campaign. The US is Israel’s biggest military supplier.
The war, which was triggered by Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terror attack, has raged for more than a year, killing at least 43,000 people, according to the Gazan health ministry. Efforts to secure a ceasefire and release of the Israel hostages held by Hamas have floundered, but there is more optimism about securing an end to the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
“What is happening in Gaza today is unspeakable,” Sanders said at a press conference Tuesday on Capitol Hill. “What makes it even more painful is that much of what is happening there has been done with US weapons and with American taxpayer support. The United States of America is complicit in these atrocities. That complicity must end and that is what these resolutions are about.”
Sanders, who is Jewish, said that “Israel clearly had a right to respond to the horrific Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7,” but criticized the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s handling of the war.
The White House actively lobbied against the effort to block the arms sales.
“We strongly oppose this resolution and we have made our position clear to interested Senators,” a White House National Security Council spokesperson told CNN in a statement.
The Senate votes highlighted an issue that has provoked contentious debate within the Democratic Party. But the effort was unable to advance in the waning days of the Biden administration and the current Senate Democratic majority.
President-elect Donald Trump, who returns to the White House in January, has already announced a strong defender of Israel as his pick for US ambassador to Israel – former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who once argued that there was “no such thing as a Palestinian.” The House and Senate will also be in Republican hands starting in January, giving Trump a GOP government trifecta to carry out his agenda.
Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell urged his colleagues not to support the resolutions ahead of the votes.
“Those who mourn senseless human suffering should have no trouble assigning blame to the terrorists who exploit civilians, schools, hospitals and mosques as cover,” he said in Senate floor remarks on Tuesday. “I hope the Senate will reject the senator’s resolutions outright.”
The Senate failed to advance three separate measures – known as resolutions of disapproval – aimed at halting certain arms sales announced by the Biden administration in August.
A resolution to block a sale of tank rounds was rejected by a vote of 18 to 79. A second resolution to block a sale of high-explosive mortar rounds was rejected by a vote of 19 to 78, and a third resolution to block a sale of joint direct attack munitions, otherwise known as JDAMS, was rejected by a vote of 17 to 80.
The resolutions were backed by a group of independent and Democratic senators.
“The sales of JDAMS and 120mm tank rounds are particularly concerning, given their indiscriminate use in Gaza,” a fact sheet released by Sanders’ office stated. “These systems account for many of the 40,534 deaths and nearly 94,000 injuries in Gaza so far – 60 percent of whom are women, children, or elderly people. Reliable human rights monitors have documented numerous incidents involving these systems leading to unacceptable civilian death and harm.”
CNN and others have reported on Israel’s use of US-made munitions, including JDAMS, in incidents that killed dozens of Palestinians.
Pro-Palestinian advocacy groups argued that the Senate votes were significant despite their failure and marked a shift for the Democratic Party.
“Today’s first-ever vote to block weapons to Israel, through the leadership of Sen. Bernie Sanders, shows Democrats are starting to learn the lessons of this election and beginning to listen to their own voters,” Hamid Bendaas, a spokesperson for the Institute for Middle East Understanding Policy Project, a pro-Palestinian advocacy group, said in a statement.

265,General Politics,2024,11,Trump announces Matthew Whitaker as his pick to be US ambassador to NATO,Jennifer Hansler,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Matthew Whitaker, who served as acting attorney general during Trump’s first term, as his pick to be US ambassador to NATO.
“Matt is a strong warrior and loyal Patriot, who will ensure the United States’ interests are advanced and defended,” Trump said in a news release Wednesday. “Matt will strengthen relationships with our NATO Allies, and stand firm in the face of threats to Peace and Stability - He will put AMERICA FIRST.”
If confirmed, Whitaker will lead the US mission to NATO during a period where the defensive alliance may still be facing one of its toughest challenges – how to continue to support Ukraine in its war against Russia. He is also likely to be tasked with increasing pressure on countries in the alliance to increase their defense spending – renewing an effort that Trump undertook in his first term.
Earlier this year, NATO announced it would establish a mission to coordinate the provision of military equipment and training for Ukraine – an effort that has been largely led by the US – in a move that some saw as an attempt to “Trump proof” support. Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance have cast doubts on the level of the US continued commitment to Kyiv as the war drags on more than two and a half years after Russian forces invaded.
During the campaign, Trump also indicated he would only adhere to NATO’s mutual defense commitment for countries who are contributing enough of their annual budgets to defense. He recounted during the campaign that “one of the presidents of a big country” at one point asked him whether the US would still defend the country if they were invaded by Russia even if they “don’t pay.”
“No, I would not protect you,” Trump recalled telling that president. “In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.”
In remarks in Paris earlier this month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called for “more robust transatlantic defense cooperation and more defense investment.”
“We must stand together – Europe, North America and our global partners - to keep our people safe and prosperous,” he said.
Trump also on Wednesday announced Michigan GOP chair Pete Hoekstra as his pick to be US ambassador to Canada, a founding member of NATO. Hoekstra, a former representative for Michigan’s 2nd Congressional District, was US ambassador to the Netherlands during the president-elect’s first term.
Whitaker, a loyal Trump ally, does not come from a foreign policy background. He served as the former acting attorney general in Trump’s first term and temporarily led the Justice Department after Trump fired Jeff Sessions.
Trump had grown frustrated with Sessions because the then-attorney general recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 campaign, including special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the election. Whitaker, on the other hand, was openly critical of the Russia investigation.
During brief tenure at the top of DOJ, Whitaker quickly took charge of Mueller from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. While Whitaker did not recuse himself like his predecessor, he repeatedly said that he had not discussed the probe with Trump.
He sparred with Democratic lawmakers who claimed that his appointment was unconstitutional. He also clashed with Democrats during congressional testimony because he often declined to answer their questions.
Before becoming the acting attorney general, Whitaker was the US attorney for the Southern District of Iowa and chief of staff to Sessions.

266,General Politics,2024,11,Absences by Trump’s Senate pals help Democrats confirm Biden judges,Tierney Sneed,"CNN
 — 
Senate Democrats have confirmed some of President Joe Biden’s picks for the federal bench this week in the face of President-elect Donald Trump’s calls for a total GOP blockade of judicial nominations – in part because several Republicans involved with the Trump transition process have been missing votes.
Conservative activists blasted Republicans’ failure to show up for the votes, prompting a since-deleted, defensive social media post Tuesday by Vice President-elect JD Vance, an Ohio Republican senator who was at Trump’s Florida resort during a significant Monday evening confirmation.
The Senate approved Embry Kidd for the 11th Circuit, an appeals court overseeing the southeast where GOP-appointees make up a narrow majority of the judges. The 49-45 vote was essentially party line, with independent Sen. Joe Manchin voting with Republicans against the nomination. Five Republicans – including Vance and Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who was also at Mar-a-Lago on Monday as he is being considered for Trump’s Cabinet – were absent, as was Democratic Sen. John Fetterman.
RELATED LIVE-STORY
Latest on Trump’s presidential transition: GOP members block release of Gaetz ethics report
Trump earlier this month had urged Senate Republicans not to allow any judicial confirmations in the final weeks of the Biden administration while the upper chamber was under Democratic control. Republicans have made the confirmation process more time-consuming for Democrats by slow-rolling procedural votes, but have not been able to block the nominees outright when members of their caucus weren’t there.
Carrie Severino – who leads the Judicial Crisis Network, which advocates for conservative judicial nominees – said in a social media post after Kidd’s confirmation said that it was “critical that Senate Republicans show up to make this more difficult and to try to block these radicals from being confirmed.”
Vance, in a post on X that he later deleted, called another critic, Grace Chong, who is CFO of Steve Bannon’s podcast organization, a “mouth breathing imbecile” after she brought attention to his absence. The tweet also revealed that Trump was planning to replace FBI Director Christopher Wray, though FBI directors have traditionally stayed on even when the White House changes party control to avoid the perception of partisan influence.
“When this 11th Circuit vote happened, I was meeting with President Trump to interview multiple positions for our government, including FBI Director,” Vance said, while arguing that Democrats would have still confirmed the nominee – even if all Republicans were there – by getting Fetterman to show up to the vote.
Vance’s office did not respond to CNN’s inquiry.
Since then, other judicial nominees have been able to clear pivotal votes because not enough Republicans were present to block them.
On Tuesday, with several GOP senators including Vance absent, the Senate approved two district court nominees who faced united Republican opposition.
One of those nominees, Sarah Russell, who was selected for Connecticut’s federal trial court, was confirmed with just 50 votes, with Manchin voting against her. Had the six absent Republicans been present and voted no, it’s likely the nomination would have failed.
Hours before the vote, Vice President Kamala Harris departed DC for a weeklong trip to Hawaii, depriving Democrats of their tiebreaker. Two of the missing Republicans, Sens. Hagerty and Ted Cruz of Texas, were with Trump to watch a SpaceX launch on Tuesday in Texas.
Neither Cruz’s nor Hagerty’s responded to CNN’s inquiries.
Several of the missing Republicans – which also included Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state – were back in the chamber Wednesday. But with Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana absent and Cruz also missing for some of the procedural votes, Democrats have been able to confirm two more nominees: Rebecca Pennell, for the US District Court in the Eastern District of Washington, and Amir Ali, for DC’s federal trial court.
(Manchin has typically, but not always, voted against any nominee that doesn’t have GOP support. He supported Ali, but independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema voted against the DC district court nominee.)

Braun’s office did not respond to CNN’s inquiry. Montana GOP Sen. Steve Daines, meanwhile, who was missing from the Monday vote on Embry but has participated in votes since, has explained that his Monday arrival in DC was delayed by multiple flight issues.
Trump took to social media again on Wednesday to complain about the absences, writing “Republican Senators need to Show Up and Hold the Line — No more Judges confirmed before Inauguration Day!”
During the lame duck session after Trump’s first term, the Senate confirmed 14 of his judicial nominees, among them, US District Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed special counsel Jack Smith’s classified documents case against the former president.
The tightwire over attendance shows the high stakes with which every judgeship is viewed.
When Trump retakes the White House next year, he will inherit far fewer vacancies than he did at the beginning of his first term. Then, he started with more than 100 judicial vacancies, in large part because of GOP tactics when it controlled the upper chamber at the end of President Barack Obama’s administration. Even if no other Biden-appointed judge is confirmed, Trump will start his second term with a number of openings that is fewer than half of that previous number.

267,General Politics,2024,11,Remote work crackdown: How Trump’s DOGE could push federal workers to quit,Rene Marsh,"CNN
 — 
President-elect Donald Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental entity helmed by billionaire Elon Musk and biotech entrepreneur and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, is expected to make a push for an end to remote work across federal agencies as a way to help reduce the federal workforce through attrition.
Both Musk and Ramaswamy have recently publicly lamented the number of employees working remotely across the government.
A source familiar with early discussions about the focus of DOGE, as the initiative is known, told CNN that while nothing is final, early priorities include an effort to immediately end remote work across federal agencies, making a five-day work week a requirement for all federal employees.
“It’s a no-brainer step and many companies have done this. So why shouldn’t federal employees who are paid with taxpayer dollars be required to be in office?” the source said.
RELATED ARTICLE
Are you a federal worker? CNN would like to talk to you
The thinking is this kind of mandate, coupled with moving agencies out of Washington, DC, would cause many federal workers to voluntarily leave, helping the new Trump administration thin out the federal workforce ranks and save the government money.
Ending remote work across government is being considered a potential “early candidate” for executive orders that members of DOGE will recommend to Trump, the source said. “It’s definitely on the table,” the source said, though it’s unclear how much they believe this will save the federal government.
On Wednesday, following the publication of this story, Musk and Ramaswamy published an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal that outlined their plans to reform the government and took aim at remote work. “Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,” they wrote.
Currently, not all federal workers are required to be in the office five days a week. Each agency determines its remote policy to best complete its mission. There are 1.3 million federal workers approved for telework, according to data from the Office of Personnel Management. Government data shows teleworking federal workers spend 60% of their time performing work in person.
“The implication that federal employees writ large are not working in-person is simply not backed up by data and reality,” Everett Kelley, national president for the American Federation of Government Employees, a union that represents more than 800,000 federal workers, told CNN in a statement. “When it comes to changes in working conditions that could impact union contracts, AFGE takes the position that such changes must be negotiated with the union through the normal collective bargaining process.”
Sources also told CNN that conservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk – who has grown close with Musk – is expected to serve as an unofficial adviser to DOGE. Kirk has taken aim at remote work, calling it “one giant looting operation and US taxpayers are their mask” on X on Monday, another sign this could be a key early priority.
Disrupting lives
Some federal employees who have been allowed to work fully remotely say that forcing them to come back to the office would upend their lives – and not necessarily save the government as much money as one might expect.
“I can’t abandon this career,” one Library of Congress worker who lives in the Midwest told CNN. “I would be forced to move back to Washington, DC, even if it means separating my family.”
The worker, who requested anonymity to protect their job, had reported to their office in Washington, DC, five days a week for many years. But when the Covid-19 pandemic hit, the employee was allowed to work remotely and moved to the Midwest to be closer to family and save money – even though it meant taking a $12,000 pay cut. They have since bought a home and entered into a relationship.
Adding to the complications, the worker doesn’t have an office to return to since others within the Library of Congress have already moved into their former space.
But some of their colleagues, particularly those with children, have said they wouldn’t be able to move back. That would hurt the Library of Congress’ mission since it, like many other government agencies, is already dealing with high turnover, the worker said.
Another federal employee who works remotely told CNN that they would have to commute two to three hours to the nearest office. That would be a deal-breaker for the worker, who has been with the federal government for more than 10 years.
“The stress would be through the roof,” said the employee, who requested anonymity to protect their job. “I am at the point where if I had to commute, I would resign. I would take this as a sign to move on and start a new chapter in my life.”
The worker, who is employed by the General Services Administration, said that forcing them to come to an office would make them less productive. Currently, they work more hours – including when they are sick or scheduled to be off – even though they don’t receive overtime pay.
Other targets beyond remote work
Remote work isn’t the only cost-cutting measure that is likely to be addressed through executive orders.
The source familiar with early discussions on DOGE said that very early on in the administration, there are expected to be several other executive orders that have the fingerprints of DOGE and are aimed at cutting costs.
But DOGE recommendations aren’t likely to solely take the form of executive orders, which can easily be overturned under future administrations, the source said. “There will also be a longer-term plan for more and deeper reductions through the rulemaking process,” the source added.
Ramaswamy recently took to social media to note plans for cutting funds for programs Congress no longer authorizes but that still receive appropriations.
“We shouldn’t let the government spend money on programs that have expired. Yet that’s exactly what happens today: half a *trillion* dollars of taxpayer funds ($516 B+) goes each year to programs which Congress has allowed to expire. There are 1,200+ programs that are no longer authorized but still receive appropriations. This is totally nuts,” he posted on X.
The source familiar with early discussions told CNN that Musk and Ramaswamy don’t plan on reinventing the wheel when it comes to determining how to best cut the fat in government spending.
“They’ll be pulling from existing reports from Congress and the executive branch and previous outside government commissions focused on cutting government spending,” the source said, noting that previous conservative targets will inform what DOGE does. “They don’t view themselves as having the only answer to government spending and efficiency.”
Musk and Ramaswamy are currently identifying all the places across the sprawling federal government where they might be able to cut, according to the source, while Ramaswamy is simultaneously taking the lead on crafting the legal justification for the cuts they recommend.
They will hire additional people eventually, but it’s going to be a small, nimble team, the source said. “It won’t be hundreds of people. It will be very small. A lot of this is going to also involve agencies identifying places to cut. It’s going to be on them too.”

268,General Politics,2024,11,Trump eyes right-wing personality Dan Bongino among current and former agents for US Secret Service director,Kristen Holmes,"CNN
 — 
Donald Trump is considering a right-wing media personality, people who have served on his US Secret Service detail, as well as others to run the agency that has been plagued by its failure to preempt two alleged assassination attempts on Trump this summer, sources familiar with the president-elect’s thinking tell CNN.
Podcaster Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who was highly critical of the agency’s leadership as security failures around the alleged attempts on Trump’s life became clear, as well as Sean Curran, the head of Trump’s current detail, are among those being considered for the job.
Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe, meanwhile, was unsuccessful in trying to set up a meeting with Trump this week.
Others on the list of potential picks include Robert Engel, the former head of Trump’s detail who was with him on January 6, 2021, and testified to the House select committee about the former president’s speech at the Ellipse that preceded the US Capitol attack.
As Trump continues to roll out names for top positions in the incoming administration, his choice for director of the Secret Service will be pivotal to the agency’s future – and a particularly personal one for the president-elect.
The agency, with low morale and an exhausted workforce following the intense 2024 campaign season, has been led for the last few months by Rowe, who took over following Director Kimberly Cheatle’s abrupt exit in the wake of the Trump assassination attempt in Pennsylvania in July.
Rowe has implemented some structural changes in the agency and oversaw the ramp-up in security for the former president during the last few months of the campaign.
Members of Congress as well as an independent review panel set up under the Department of Homeland Security have said the Secret Service needs a complete revamp and would benefit from an outsider coming in and refocusing the agency to its core mission of protection.
Bongino, an ardent Trump supporter, was highly critical of Cheatle, accusing her of making “putting politics ahead of presidential protection” and saying she was “utterly unqualified.”
In a podcast last week, Bongino said he hadn’t had any formal conversations about the position.
Bongino spent more than a decade in the Secret Service and individuals who worked with him praised him as a stellar agent.
Some in the agency, however, have noted that Bongino and the other names being floated lack administrative experience, though that has not deterred Trump from making other unorthodox picks, such as former Rep. Matt Gaetz to lead the Justice Department.
Another issue for Curran could be the close, trusted relationship he has built with Trump, who may want him to stay on as head of his protection for the first few years of his administration, one source familiar with Trump’s thinking told CNN.
Engel and former Secret Service Assistant Director Tony Ornato became key figures in the House January 6 committee’s investigation after former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified that Ornato told her Trump had lunged at Engel after being told he could not go to the Capitol following his Ellipse speech.

269,General Politics,2024,11,Georgia election workers defamed by Rudy Giuliani ask judge to hold him in contempt in new legal threat,Katelyn Polantz,"CNN
 — 
Two Georgia election workers who won a massive verdict against Rudy Giuliani because he defamed them after the 2020 election are asking a federal judge to hold him in contempt of court.
Their request on Wednesday morning opens up a new avenue of difficulty in court that the former Donald Trump attorney now must face, as the fallout continues for him because of his efforts to spread election fraud myths.
The pair, Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, say Trump continues to repeat harmful lies about them on his nightly broadcast, in defiance of court orders.
RELATED LIVE-STORY
The latest on Trump’s presidential transition
“In his latest act of defiance of court orders, and continued defamation of Plaintiffs, Defendant Rudolph W. Giuliani has clearly violated a permanent injunction — an injunction to which he consented to less than one year ago — prohibiting him from repeating his false and defamatory lies about Plaintiffs. Accordingly, the Court should hold him in contempt and enter civil contempt sanctions,” Freeman and Moss’ lawyers wrote to Judge Beryl Howell in the DC District Court.
The judge has not yet responded, and any penalties would be up to her.
Moss and Freeman’s attorneys pointed to two broadcasts of Giuliani’s show, where he said people were quadruple counting ballots and passing hard drives to rig vote-counting machines. Those insinuations are false, and there was no conspiracy to change votes against Trump in Georgia in 2020, a state where he closely lost the election.
“These statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating. They constitute unambiguous violations of the Consent Injunction,” Freeman and Moss’ lawyers wrote.
Giuliani on his November 12 broadcast, acknowledged he could face more consequences in court for his statements that day.
“I’m sorry they’re going to sue me again for saying it but what am I going to do but tell the truth,” he said.
An attorney for Giuliani, Joseph R. Cammarata, also held a press conference on Wednesday morning in front of the Manhattan law office of Moss and Freeman’s attorneys.
“They are doing everything they can to stop me and Giuliani from having a formidable defense. We’re not going to allow. That’s not going to take place in the United States. That’s not who we are,” Cammarata said.
Howell on Wednesday afternoon gave Giuliani until December 2 to respond to the request to hold him in contempt and asked him to describe “the recommended appropriate sanction to coerce” his compliance now with the settlement he agreed to six months ago.
She set a hearing for December 12, saying Giuliani must appear in her courtroom in person in Washington, DC.
Howell presided over the trial where a jury found Giuliani defamed Freeman and Moss so severely that he should pay them $150 million. She previously signed off on a settlement to bar Giuliani from continuing to repeat lies about votes being stolen during the vote count in Georgia in 2020, and from speaking about Moss and Freeman, which he was doing even during the course of the trial a year ago.
In that settlement, which came soon after the jury verdict, Giuliani agreed he could be held in contempt of court if he publicly suggested again they stole votes.

The settlement agreement said Giuliani would be “permanently enjoined from publishing, causing others to publish, and/or assisting in others’ publication of any statements that suggest that Plaintiffs, whether mentioned directly, indirectly, or by implication, engaged in wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election.”
In the year since, the women, a mother and daughter, have collected some of Giuliani’s luxury possessions like a classic convertible and watches to make good on that debt, and are still working to take control of his real estate assets and Yankees World Series rings.
Giuliani is losing his $6 million New York apartment to the two women, but is arguing to keep the $3.5 million Florida condo where he is currently staying, and the championship rings, worth potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars collectively.
He has already lost his law license because of his work for the Trump campaign in 2020, which included his efforts in Georgia.

270,General Politics,2024,11,Republican’s effort to block first transgender House member from using women’s bathrooms brings campaign issue to the Capitol,Annie Grayer,"CNN
 — 
On one side of the Capitol, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace vowed to “stand in the way” of Democratic Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, the first out transgender woman elected to Congress, using women’s bathrooms in the US Capitol.
Across the building, McBride was privately counseling her Democratic colleagues how to balance both pushing back on dehumanizing rhetoric while also staying on message. McBride, who came up through the Delaware legislature, assured Democrats that she has faced similar attacks before and was not going to let this define her.
“This is not her first rodeo,” Democratic Rep. Becca Balint said of McBride. “I’m so impressed by the way Rep. McBride is really helping us navigate this. Because she said, ‘If we let them, this entire Congress, all we’ll talk about is bathrooms.’”
Transgender rights, and how politicians talk about them, became a divisive issue that President-elect Donald Trump emphasized at the close of the presidential campaign, and Republican lawmakers are picking up the baton to carry the culture war forward on Capitol Hill. The GOP effort has also resurfaced frustrations among Democrats who believe the party failed to forcefully respond to the anti-transgender attacks from Republicans during the campaign.
Mace, of South Carolina, introduced a resolution Monday to amend the rules of the US House of Representatives to ban transgender women from women’s restrooms at the Capitol and filed broader legislation that would apply to every federal building and federally funded school. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia took the rhetoric further, threatening violence against McBride if she entered a women’s bathroom and calling the congresswoman-elect “mentally ill.”
On Wednesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced he is banning transgender women from using the women’s restrooms, changing rooms and locker rooms in the Capitol but did not outline a plan to enforce it.
“All single-sex facilities in the Capitol and House Office Buildings — such as restrooms, changing rooms, and locker rooms — are reserved for individuals of that biological sex,” the speaker said in a statement. “It is important to note that each Member office has its own private restroom, and unisex restrooms are available throughout the Capitol.”
When pressed on how these policies could be enforced, Johnson told reporters, “Like all House policies, it’s enforceable. We have single-sex facilities for a reason. Women deserve women-only spaces. We’re not anti-anyone.”
In a post on X on Wednesday, McBride said she will honor whatever rules are introduced.
“I’m not here to fight about bathrooms. I’m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families. Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them,” she wrote.
Johnson outlined the tension for him around the issue on Tuesday.
“A man is a man, and a woman is a woman, and a man cannot become a woman,” the Louisiana Republican told reporters.
But Johnson, a devout Christian, added: “But I also believe that we treat everybody with dignity. And so … we can do and believe all those things at the same time. And I wanted to make that clear for everybody because there’s lots of questions. But that’s where I stand.”

Mace told CNN the speaker has assured her it will be included in the House rules package.
Johnson is weighing various factors as he tries to resolve the issue. The speaker could instruct the Committee on House Administration to have signage put up on bathrooms or issue a campus-wide directive. Other lawmakers say Johnson is working on making a special accommodation for McBride.
But Republicans discussing the issue privately say that any steps Johnson takes would be difficult to enforce. Although Mace’s resolution is in response to McBride coming to Congress, there are many transgender people who work and visit the Capitol.
“Those of us who want to be reasonable about things are having trouble with how you legislate this,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN.
As Mace puts the issue front and center, there are some in the GOP conference who don’t want bathroom use to even be a topic of conversation, including the party’s incoming conference chair.
“I agree with [Mace], but I got to be honest with you: We got so much work to do,” GOP Rep. Lisa McClain told CNN. “Can we focus on policy?”
And others want to refrain from weighing in and instead are leaving the issue strictly in Johnson’s hands.
“I think the speaker will figure that situation out,” Rep. Richard Hudson, who leads the House GOP campaign arm, told CNN.
Democrats tear into Republicans while some say party has work to do
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Democratic leadership tore into House Republicans on Tuesday for focusing on anti-transgender sentiment and culture wars by targeting McBride instead of prioritizing legislative priorities.
“The notion that this incoming small House Republican Conference majority is beginning to transition to the new Congress by bullying a member of Congress, this is what we’re doing? This is the lesson that you’ve drawn from the election in November?” Jeffries said.
But Democrats also acknowledge the party has work to do to establish its position on culture war issues that Republicans have used to turn out their base.

Many are still stunned that during the presidential campaign, Kamala Harris never responded to Trump ads targeting the vice president over her past support of taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for detained immigrants and federal prisoners. The ads flooded the airwaves across key battleground states and demographics in the closing days of the race.
“It was a perfect culture war ad to lay the trans stuff on top of support for felons. I don’t understand anymore than you why the presidential campaign didn’t respond to that,” one Democratic lawmaker told CNN.

Although House Democrats agree that transgender people need to be treated with dignity and want to call out Republicans for dehumanizing rhetoric, there is disagreement in the caucus over how to address the issue of transgender athletes. Some Democratic lawmakers acknowledged their party has left a vacuum that could be detrimental if it continues to be filled only by Republicans.
Democratic Rep. Seth Moulton, who has faced backlash for his position against transgender athletes participating in sports, told CNN that Democrats need to recalibrate on the issue.
“I don’t think the issue is that we’re not listening to ourselves. The issue is that we’re not listening to fellow Americans,” he said.
Democratic lawmakers are appealing to their leadership to get more involved and are calling on members who are part of the LGBTQ+ community to help lead the way in crafting an effective response. It will all be part of the listening sessions that House Democratic leadership has instituted as the party processes their election losses.
“This is something we are wrestling with as a nation, and we have to talk about it as a family,” another Democratic lawmaker told CNN.

271,General Politics,2024,11,Pennsylvania Democratic official apologizes for comments about ignoring election laws,Sara Murray,"CNN
 — 
A Democratic election official in Pennsylvania offered an impassioned apology Wednesday for claiming “precedent by a court doesn’t matter anymore in this country” to justify counting about 600 faulty ballots in defiance of state Supreme Court rulings.
“The passion in my heart got the best of me and I apologize again for that,” Bucks County Commissioner Diane Ellis-Marseglia said in front of a fiery crowd at a county meeting.
“I made a mistake, and because I am an elected official, I am held to a far higher standard than everybody else. So, to the citizens I serve, I apologize, and I will continue to work hard for you and endeavor to not make such a mistake again.”
Ellis-Marseglia said she received expletive-laden criticism and death threats following her prior comments. She also said other county employees have been flooded with threats.

Latest on Trump’s presidential transition: Vance joins Gaetz on Capitol Hill to shore up support
Throughout her apology, the packed room – which included many supporters of President-elect Donald Trump – heckled Ellis-Marseglia, and some held up signs that said “tyrant.” Others called for her resignation and prosecution and accused her of trying to count illegal votes to help Democrats hold onto a US Senate seat.
Her prior comments about flouting court precedent took off on social media and were promoted widely by Trump allies like Elon Musk.
Ellis-Marseglia and another Democrat on the three-member panel voted to count misdated mail ballots and unsigned provisional ballots, over the objections of the lone GOP commissioner, the county’s attorney, and in defiance of the state’s top court, which ruled before the election that ballots with these deficiencies are invalid.
This is unfolding amid a closely watched recount in the state’s US Senate race between Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican Dave McCormick, who leads by about 17,000 votes. CNN has not made a projection in that race.
“I think we all know that precedent by a court doesn’t matter anymore in this country, and people violate laws any time they want,” Ellis-Marseglia said at a meeting last week. “So, for me, if I violate this law, it’s because I want a court to pay attention to it. There’s nothing more important than counting votes.”
Ellis-Marseglia and the other Democratic commissioner, Robert Harvie, justified their actions by arguing that they didn’t want to disenfranchise voters, and that the matter would surely be settled by the courts. The 600 or so faulty ballots, they argued, were only missing a date or signature because voters weren’t given clear instructions.
Wednesday, Ellis-Marseglia said her past comment that precedent “doesn’t matter” was a reference to the US Supreme Court’s decision overturning Roe v. Wade, drawing groans from the crowd.
In response to a lawsuit from the McCormick campaign, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Monday ordered counties to abide by its past rulings about the undated ballots. Some of the justices blasted officials from Bucks and other counties for upending the “rule of law.”
Republican officials in battleground states across the country were under a microscope this election season because of fears that they might flout laws around election processes, such as certifying election results.
Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro also weighed in this week on counties appearing to defy the state’s highest court.
“As we move forward, I want to be clear: any insinuation that our laws can be ignored or do not matter is irresponsible and does damage to faith in our electoral process,” Shapiro said in a statement on Monday.
Patricia Poprik, chair of the Bucks County Republican Party, on Wednesday said the board’s actions overshadowed the hard work of county election workers.
Poprik has had doubts about the 2020 results and served as a fake elector for Trump. But in the run up to the presidential election this year, Poprik told CNN she had faith in the process after local election officials had been transparent and walked her and others through the entire system for processing and counting ballots.
On Wednesday, she was again critical.
“Something’s wrong with the way we are conducting the elections in this county,” Poprik said. “Now it’s become the laughingstock and the embarrassment.”

272,General Politics,2024,11,Biden set to use his pardon power Monday for Thanksgiving turkey tradition,Betsy Klein,"Washington
CNN
 — 
With just two months until he leaves office, President Joe Biden is gearing up to utilize his presidential pardon power for fowl reasons.
Justice will be served Monday as Biden pardons the national Thanksgiving turkeys on the White House South Lawn, CNN has exclusively learned, participating in the 77th annual tradition of the turkey presentation, according to a White House official.
The president will talk turkey and make much ado about stuffing at his fourth and final Thanksgiving roast, a yearly opportunity for a cornucopia of puns and a moment to give thanks – providing some levity amid a range of global crises and the aftermath of a hectic campaign season.
Weighing in at 40 and 41 pounds, this year’s birds were hatched in July in Northfield, Minnesota, and will ride the gravy train to Washington over the weekend, according to Alex Davidson, a spokesperson for the National Turkey Federation. They’ll spend the customary night in a luxe suite at the nearby Willard Hotel, where their names will be unveiled at a press conference. They will be presented to Biden by National Turkey Federation chair John Zimmerman, who raised the turkeys on his independent farm.
Following their expected pardon, both turkeys will retreat to Farmamerica, an agricultural interpretative center in southern Minnesota, Davidson said.
Rumors of turkey pardons go back in presidential history as far as Abraham Lincoln’s administration. Folklore has it that Lincoln’s young son asked his father to spare a pet turkey that was supposed to be part of their Thanksgiving dinner.
A competitive version of the ceremony became national news in 1920, when a turkey from Texas sent to Woodrow Wilson in a White House-shaped crate battled outside the White House with a turkey from Kentucky. The Kentucky bird emerged victorious, according to the White House Historical Association.
The National Turkey Foundation became the official turkey supplier to the first family in 1947, and the formal turkey presentation ceremony has been around since Harry Truman. Truman was the first to accept a turkey from the group – however, he did not spare it.
The first documented turkey pardon was given by John F. Kennedy in 1963, though it didn’t catch on right away. Even though Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon, neither one of them decided to pardon any turkeys as president.
Turkey pardoning became the norm in 1989, when George H.W. Bush revived the tradition, now a staple of the White House holiday season.
Biden’s most recent predecessors have peppered their pardons with turkey and other topical political puns.
After the 2022 midterm elections, Biden joked that the two birds were part of “another flock hoping to come to Washington in 2024.”
“The votes are in, they’ve been counted and verified, no ballot stuffing, no fowl play. The only red wave this season is going to be if German shepherd Commander knocks over the cranberry sauce,” he said.
Donald Trump poked fun at the impeachment inquiry against him in 2019, telling a crowd that the turkeys “have already received subpoenas to appear in Adam Schiff’s basement,” referring to the California Democratic then-congressman.
And Barack Obama employed his signature rhetoric in 2016: “I want to take a moment to recognize the great turkeys who weren’t so lucky, who didn’t get to ride the gravy train to freedom. Who met their fate with courage and sacrifice and proved that they weren’t chicken.”
“Yes, we cran,” Obama added.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/politics/joe-biden-turkey-pardon/index.html
273,General Politics,2024,11,3 urgent tasks awaiting Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary,Tami Luhby,"CNN
 — 
Ensuring the US doesn’t default on its obligations. Extending trillions of dollars in tax cuts before they expire. Quarterbacking President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for the economy.
The incoming Treasury secretary, whomever Trump ultimately picks, will face a confluence of deadlines and campaign promises that will make the early days on the job even more challenging than usual.
By the time Trump takes office, it’s likely that the US will have hit the debt ceiling, forcing the Treasury Department to use so-called extraordinary measures to allow it to continue paying the nation’s bills on time and in full. And congressional Republicans will be rushing to extend Trump’s landmark 2017 tax cuts act before a multitude of pricey provisions lapse at the end of next year.
All the while, the secretary-to-be will have to help execute Trump’s economic gameplan, which was voters’ top concern in the election.
“We have twin fiscal cliffs that start off next year. The debt limit begins the year, the tax cuts end the year,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “The Treasury secretary is going to be at the center of those fights and is going to be monitoring the economic impact.”
Dealing with the debt ceiling
The Treasury Department will likely have to deal with the debt limit at the start of the new year. Congress suspended the cap as part of the 2023 debt ceiling agreement, but it will return effective January 2.
The Treasury secretary has to inform Congress that the US has hit the ceiling and outline the extraordinary measures it will take to avoid defaulting on the nation’s obligations. The current secretary, Janet Yellen, will likely make those initial moves since Trump will not take office until his inauguration on January 20. His Cabinet picks, including the Treasury secretary, traditionally have to be confirmed by the Senate.
But after the switch in administrations, it will be up to the incoming secretary to continue deploying those measures, monitoring the agency’s continued ability to pay the bills and keeping lawmakers and other stakeholders informed.
“This will be a unique occurrence in the modern history of the debt limit where we have a transition from one administration to another in the middle of a debt limit episode,” said Shai Akabas, executive director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Economic Policy Program, noting that in Trump’s first term, then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was confirmed the month before a debt limit suspension expired.
Though the debt ceiling is set to return in January, the nation is not expected to be in danger of defaulting on its obligations until later in the year – giving the incoming Treasury secretary some time to ramp up. But conveying the status of the department’s ability to pay the bills to lawmakers, holders of US debt and others is critical.
“Because of the weight of the issue, it’s important to have someone delivering that message who is a respected figure of authority,” Akabas said.
Extending the Trump tax cuts
Addressing the expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will be among the top priorities of both congressional Republicans and Trump, who promised frequently on the campaign trail that he would extend – and even expand on – the package from his first term.
RELATED ARTICLE
Trump made a lot of tax promises. Can he keep them?
The incoming Treasury secretary will likely be a key voice in developing the plan, which will not be that easy since extending the provisions is expected to cost roughly $4.6 trillion. To pass the package, Republicans will need to use reconciliation, a procedure that would allow the party to approve legislation in the Senate with fewer than the standard 60 votes.
The law’s sweeping array of temporary tax cuts lowered many of the individual income tax rates, including the top rate from 39.6% to 37% for the highest earners; nearly doubled the standard deduction so only about 10% of filers now itemize their deductions; and capped the state and local tax deduction at $10,000 per filer.
Also, the TCJA doubled the annual child tax credit to $2,000 and allowed more higher-income parents to claim it; essentially doubled the estate and gift tax exemption so even fewer wealthy people are subject to it; and created a special deduction for the owners of certain pass-through entities who pay their business taxes on their individual tax returns.
“The Treasury secretary has historically played a significant role in advancing the administration’s tax policy priorities,” Akabas said. “So I would expect that the next Treasury secretary will be engaged as the Republicans try to move reconciliation legislation, both in terms of engagement with Capitol Hill and in terms of relations with media and other external stakeholders.”
Managing the Trump economy
Deep frustration with the state of the US economy helped deliver the White House to Trump, who has promised to get the cost of living under control. Voters who gave the economy low marks swung heavily in Trump’s direction, according to CNN exit polls.
Next year, Trump’s Treasury secretary will act as the quarterback, executing his economic gameplan.
That means selling the public, lawmakers, investors and CEOs on Trump’s plans to shake things up by imposing steep tariffs, waging mass deportations and delivering tax cuts – in a way that doesn’t cause the inflation that mainstream economists have warned of.
“The Treasury secretary is basically the economy czar,” said Mills.
It will also fall to Trump’s Treasury secretary to put out fires in financial markets or in the real economy like the regional bank failures that rocked Wall Street and Washington early last year.
“Whenever there is turmoil in the market, the first place you look is Treasury,” said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG.
In addition, Treasury serves as Washington’s banker, managing the day-to-day cash needs of the federal government. It falls upon Treasury officials to plan out how much money to borrow by issuing short-and long-term debt. Treasury must make sure those borrowing plans don’t rattle the bond market, spiking interest rates.
It’s an especially critical task these days given concerns about high federal budget deficits that economists, investors and analysts fear could get even bigger during the next Trump administration. The Trump agenda could spike the national debt by nearly $8 trillion, according to projections by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Trump’s Treasury pick will also help manage the complicated relationship between the president and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
“The concern in the market is how aggressive Trump is going to be bashing Powell publicly and what that means for the Fed’s independence,” said Mills.

274,General Politics,2024,11,Biden administration approves sending anti-personnel mines to Ukraine in another major policy shift,Oren Liebermann,"CNN
 — 
The Biden administration has approved sending anti-personnel mines to Ukraine for the first time in another major policy shift, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed on Wednesday.
The decision comes just days after the US gave Ukraine permission to fire long-range US missiles at targets in Russia, a shift that only occurred after months of lobbying from Kyiv.
The US intends for Kyiv to use the anti-personnel mines in the eastern part of the country, US officials said, where Russian troops have made slow and steady progress against Ukrainian defensive lines. The grinding battle has cost Moscow tremendously, with Ukraine claiming Russia suffered its highest number of casualties this week. But Russia’s unrelenting pressure, coupled with shortages in Ukrainian manpower and ammunition, has allowed the Russian military to gradually seize more territory.
Austin told reporters on Wednesday that the decision was motivated by Russia’s changing tactics on the frontlines.
“Because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they’ve kind of changed their tactics a bit,” Austin told reporters in Laos.
“They don’t lead with their mechanized forces anymore. They lead with dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces,” he explained.
Austin said Ukraine’s military needs “things that can help slow down that effort.”
The US expects Ukraine to use these anti-personnel mines to bolster defensive lines within sovereign Ukrainian territory, not as an offensive capability in Russia. The US has also sought assurances that Ukraine will try to limit the risk to civilians from the mines.

Biden’s major missile reversal complicates potential western diplomatic thaw with Moscow
The administration’s decision was first reported by the Washington Post.
Since the early days of the war, the US has provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines to blunt Russia’s numerical superiority in armored vehicles. But until now, the Biden administration had not provided Ukraine with anti-personnel mines over concerns about the enduring danger they may pose. Human rights groups have long criticized the use of anti-personnel mines because they can kill indiscriminately and can remain armed for years after the conflict in which they were initially used has ended.
In June 2022 – four months after the start of the war in Ukraine – the Biden administration pledged to limit the use of anti-personnel mines. In announcing the decision, which was a reversal from the earlier Trump administration, the White House said there was a “need to curtail the use of (anti-personnel mines) worldwide.” The US said that it would no longer develop or export anti-personnel mines and would work to destroy all of its existing stockpiles. (The one exception to the policy was South Korea.)

The announcement of anti-personnel mines for Ukraine, especially with only weeks left in the Biden administration, is a sudden change on what had been a long-standing policy.

Putin rattles nuclear saber over US role in Ukraine
The type of mines the US provides to Ukraine will be “non-persistent,” according to the officials, meaning they have an internal mechanism to shorten the lifespan of the trigger. The mines are designed to become inert after a set period of time ranging from as little as four hours to two weeks, the officials said. The mines use an electrical fuse that requires a battery, and the mine becomes inert when the battery runs out.
Russia has deployed anti-personnel mines and anti-tank mines since the earliest days of the war. As Russian forces advanced into Ukraine and established their own defensive lines, they established minefields to slow any Ukraine counterattack. Last summer, as Ukrainian forces mounted an ultimately unsuccessful counteroffensive, one Ukrainian official described the density of Russian mines as “insane.”

 — 
President-elect Donald Trump has named his transition co-chair Linda McMahon as his pick to serve as the next secretary of the Department of Education.
The decision, which Trump announced Tuesday night confirming CNN’s earlier reporting, took shape after it became clear that McMahon would be passed over for Commerce secretary. Trump named his other transition co-chair, Howard Lutnick, as his pick to lead the Commerce Department earlier Tuesday after the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO had thrown his name into the mix for Treasury secretary, sparking a battle with hedge fund manager Scott Bessent.

“Linda will use her decades of Leadership experience, and deep understanding of both Education and Business, to empower the next Generation of American Students and Workers, and make America Number One in Education in the World. We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort,” Trump said in a statement.
McMahon, a major Republican donor and a former pro-wrestling executive, served as the administrator of the Small Business Administration during Trump’s first term. She was appointed in 2017 and resigned in 2019 to become the chair of America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC.
She is the board chair of the America First Policy Institute, a pro-Trump think tank that was formed in 2021 by McMahon, Larry Kudlow and other advisers from the first Trump administration.
AFPI has raised millions of dollars since it was founded and has been described as a “White-House-in-waiting,” planning potential policy proposals for Trump’s second term.
Trump’s education secretary could potentially be tasked with overseeing the department’s demise after the president-elect repeatedly called for abolishing the agency on the campaign trail.
It would be difficult to get rid of the entire department, which delivers federal funding to nearly every public K-12 school in the country and manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. And shutting it down would require an act of Congress.

What the next Trump presidency could mean for US education
It may be more likely that some programs are moved to other federal agencies. The overarching goal for many Republicans is to reduce the federal government’s role in local education, which could be achieved by retaining funding programs but delivering money to states and schools with fewer strings attached.
Under the new education secretary, the department may use the formal regulatory process to undo changes the Biden administration made to Title IX that sought to expand protections for LGBTQ+ students. A new rule could potentially say that Title IX prevents trans students from playing on girls’ sports teams, something Trump campaigned on.
McMahon is also the former CEO of the WWE, which she co-founded with her husband, Vince McMahon. As head of the WWE, Linda McMahon oversaw its transformation from a small wrestling entertainment company into a publicly traded media empire. She stepped down as CEO in 2009.
McMahon twice ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in Connecticut, losing in 2010 and 2012. She self-funded those campaigns, spending $50.1 million in 2010 and $48.7 million in 2012, according to Open Secrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks campaign financing. Trump donated $5,000 to her campaign in 2012.
McMahon herself is a major Republican donor. During Trump’s first campaign for president, McMahon donated more than $7 million to two pro-Trump super PACs, according to Open Secrets.

Hegseth’s comments made during the call, which was hosted by the Republican National Committee and co-chair Lara Trump, are some of his first since he was announced as a pick for the president-elect’s Cabinet.
Hegseth asked those on the call to pray for Trump, incoming first lady Melania Trump and their family.
“This is a battle that is just beginning,” Hegseth said, noting his wife Jennifer was seated next to him as he was speaking. “I know in our family, we take that time to hold them up in prayer.”
The veteran-turned-Fox News host noted that his family has had “an outpouring of support” since he was named Trump’s selection for the defense post.
“That’s the reason why we can endure the attacks and the onslaughts,” he said.
Lara Trump, the president-elect’s daughter-in-law, weighed in after Hegseth’s remarks, saying the nation was “lucky” to have Hegseth as its next defense secretary.
Donald Trump selected Hegseth last week for the position despite him having no senior military or public office experience, which surprised both Pentagon officials and Trump’s own allies. The president-elect’s announcement was swiftly followed by news of the alleged sexual assault, catching the president-elect’s transition team off guard.
CNN previously reported that Hegseth, according to his attorney, paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault in a settlement agreement that included a confidentiality clause. Hegseth denies assaulting the woman and has characterized the October 2017 incident in Monterey, California, as a “consensual sexual encounter,” his attorney has said.
Hegseth has not been charged in any criminal case or named as a defendant in any civil lawsuit in connection with the incident.
Despite the controversy, Trump has refused to back down on his pick, and Vice President-elect JD Vance is expected to take Hegseth and other Cabinet contenders to Capitol Hill this week for meetings with key Republican senators who are considering their confirmation.

277,General Politics,2024,11,"House has ‘numerous’ photos from women who say they were paid a total of more than $10,000 by Gaetz for sex, lawyer says",Tierney Sneed,"CNN
 — 
Two women who claim they were paid for sex by former Rep. Matt Gaetz provided House ethics investigators with “numerous” photos related to time they spent with the Florida Republican, a lawyer for the women said Tuesday, including from an alleged 2019 trip to New York.
The women said they were paid by the former congressman for sex on that trip, during which they also joined Gaetz at a Fox News studio while he filmed a TV appearance, their attorney Joel Leppard told CNN’s Erin Burnett on “OutFront.” Gaetz allegedly covered the women’s travel costs as well, Leppard said.
The women additionally provided the House Ethics Committee with selfies Gaetz is said to have sent them, according to their lawyer. They also testified that they sent nude photos to Gaetz, sometimes at his request, Leppard said.
Gaetz was recently tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as his attorney general and resigned from Congress last week, effectively ending the ethics probe into him. The panel had investigated allegations of misconduct against Gaetz, including “sexual misconduct and illicit drug use,” and is considering whether to release a report on its findings.
Asked by the committee whether they ever felt pressured by Gaetz, Leppard said one of his clients testified that she felt the need to “please” the then-congressman before attending an electronic music show during the New York visit.
CNN has reached out to Gaetz for comment. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Leppard’s account of the testimony provides more insight into the evidence the House committee collected in its probe, which was conducted in addition to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz – a decision the former congressman has pointed to as he has vehemently denied the accusations, which also include the claim that he had sex with a then-underage woman who went on to testify in both investigations.
“Merrick Garland’s DOJ cleared Matt Gaetz and didn’t charge him,” a spokesperson for Gaetz told CNN last week.
As the Senate prepares to formally consider Gaetz for the attorney general role, Democrats and some Republicans are calling for access to the House panel’s report. After Gaetz abruptly resigned from Congress upon Trump’s selection announcement, the committee delayed plans to meet to discuss the report’s release and is next scheduled to meet Wednesday. House Mike Speaker Johnson, who in the past has said he will stay out of the ethics committee’s business, has expressed opposition to the release of the report.
Leppard noted the House panel heard testimony from several other witnesses.
“The evidence that the House has, I would presume, is overwhelming, because my clients were just two of the other witnesses, and there are very important witnesses who have yet to come out and give a preview of what the House Ethics Committee results might show,” he said.
House investigators, according to the lawyer, asked the two women about records they had obtained showing payments, largely transmitted electronically, allegedly made to them by Gaetz. Leppard said the records showed one of his clients was paid more than $6,000 by the congressman and the other more than $4,000.
“What I’m telling you is just a fraction of the evidence that’s available, of the thousands of documents” the House obtained, Leppard said.

278,Ukraine,2024,11,Putin says Russia launched a new missile in Ukraine. Here’s what we know,Catherine Nicholls,"CNN
 — 
Russia launched a new non-nuclear ballistic missile with medium range on Ukraine’s Dnipro region on Thursday, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said in a televised statement, marking another significant escalation in the 1,000-day-old war.
At least three people were injured in the attack, the head of the Dnipro’s military administration had said earlier. A number of buildings were also damaged.
Here’s what we know.
What is Russia saying?
Russian President Vladimir Putin said a Russian strike in Ukraine was carried out by a new non-nuclear ballistic missile, which has a medium range.
“In response to the use of American and British long-range weapons, on November 21 of this year the Russian armed forces launched a combined strike on one of the facilities of the Ukrainian defense industry,” Putin said in a televised statement.
“In combat conditions, one of the newest Russian medium-range missile systems was also tested,” Putin said, apparently referring to the strike on Dnipro. “In this case, with a ballistic missile in non-nuclear hypersonic equipment. Our missilemen called it ‘Oreshnik.’ The tests were successful. The launch goal was achieved.”
This comes after a US official told CNN earlier on Thursday that Russia used an “experimental medium-range” ballistic missile in an attack on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro.
A medium-range missile can travel between 1,000 kilometers and 3,000 kilometers (620 miles to 1,860 miles), according to the Center for Arms Control and Anti-Proliferation.
Putin also said that Moscow considers itself entitled to use weapons against military targets belonging countries that allow their weapons to be used against Russia. He said that Ukrainian Armed Forces attacked targets in Russia’s Bryansk region with six US-made ATACMS missiles on Tuesday and later fired British/French Storm Shadow systems on the Kursk region.
“From that moment, as we have repeatedly emphasized earlier, the regionally provoked conflict in Ukraine took on elements of a global nature,” Putin said, adding that “using such weapons without the direct involvement of military specialists from the countries that produce these weapons is impossible.”
“We consider ourselves entitled to use our weapons against the military objects of those countries that allow their weapons to be used against our objects, and in the event of an escalation of aggressive actions, we will respond just as decisively and in kind,” he added.
What is Ukraine saying?
Ukraine has not yet commented on Putin’s announcement
Ukraine’s air force earlier accused Russia of launching an intercontinental ballistic missile at Dnipro at around 5 a.m. local time, from the Astrakhan region of southern Russia, without offering further detail. However, two Western officials disputed Ukraine’s assessment, saying that although the missile launched by Russia was likely a ballistic missile, it was not an intercontinental one.
Ukraine’s military also said that an X-47M2 Kinzhal ballistic missile was launched alongside seven cruise missiles in the attack, adding that all but one of the cruise missiles were shot down. “The other missiles didn’t cause significant consequences,” the military said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky framed the strike was evidence that Putin is “so afraid, he is already using new missiles.”
“Today, our crazy neighbor has once again shown who he really is and how he despises dignity, freedom, and human life in general,” Zelensky said in a video posted to Telegram before Putin’s televised address.
What are others saying?
The United Nations Secretary General’s spokesperson warned on Thursday that Russia’s use of a new, medium-range ballistic missile is “yet another concerning and worrying development.”
“All of this [is] going in the wrong direction. What we want to see is for all parties to take urgent steps to de-escalate the situation,” Stephane Dujarric said in a regular briefing on Thursday, adding that “what we want to see is an end to this conflict in line with General Assembly resolutions, international law, and territorial integrity.”
Why is this significant?
Putin’s announcement comes during a tense week in the conflict, which is now more than 1,000 days old.
This week, both US and British/French-made missiles have been fired into Russia by Ukraine, after US President Joe Biden gave Ukraine permission to use longer-range American missiles across the border.
On Tuesday, Russia’s Defense Ministry and two US officials said Ukraine had fired the US-made ATACMS into Russia for the first time.
Russia’s Defense Ministry also said its air defenses shot down two British/French-made Storm Shadow missiles, acknowledging Ukraine’s use of the longer-range weapons.
In turn, Putin updated Russia’s nuclear doctrine, with the Kremlin saying the revised military doctrine would in theory lower the bar for first use of nuclear weapons.

How does Ukraine defend itself?
Ukraine uses a Patriot missile defense system supplied by the US and Germany to intercept incoming ballistic missile warheads, according to the Missile Threat Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
The Patriot system is designed to engage incoming warheads, either with an exploding warhead of its own, or with kinetic interceptors – so-called “hit-to-kill” technology, which destroys the incoming warhead by striking it directly.
Patriot interceptors have a vertical range of about 20 kilometers (12 miles) and defend an area of about 15 to 20 kilometers around the battery, according to the Congressional Research Service.
But Ukraine has only a limited number of Patriots and batteries. Some cities, like the capital Kyiv, enjoy greater protection than others.
Why was Dnipro targeted?
The Dnipropetrovsk region has been a frequent target of Russian bombardment in recent months.
It borders the partially occupied Donetsk and Zaporizhzhia regions and has become a hub for people who have fled areas that are now under Russian control.
The region is now home to more than 400,000 internally displaced people. Dnipro, the fourth-largest city in Ukraine, is an important center of life in the eastern part of the country.
It is relatively close to the front lines, yet still fairly well protected by air defenses. That, plus its transportation infrastructure links to the rest of the country, makes the city a key hub in Ukraine’s war effort.

How much damage did the attack cause?
The head of Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk military administration said Russia was “massively attacking” the region on Thursday morning.
Three people were injured after houses were damaged, and a rehabilitation center for people with disabilities was also impacted in the attack, Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram.
There were two fires in Dnipro and “damage to an industrial enterprise,” he added.

 — 
Ukraine launched the British-French-made Storm Shadow missiles at targets inside Russia for the first time on Wednesday, according to a Russian military blog and Reuters, a day after Ukraine fired US-made ATACMS missiles into Russia.
Ukraine’s use of the UK-supplied missiles to hit Russian territory was confirmed to Reuters by an official on condition of anonymity. British media also reported the use of the cruise missile on Wednesday, citing sources.
Ukraine’s Defense Minister Rustem Umerov refused to confirm or deny the use of the UK-French-made missiles during a Wednesday news conference. Nor did a spokesperson for the UK Ministry of Defense when asked by CNN. CNN has reached out to the French Ministry of Defense for comment.
When Umerov was asked if Ukraine used the Storm Shadow missiles to hit a target inside Russia, he replied, “we are using all the means to defend our country, so we’ll not go into detail. But we are just sending that we are capable and able to respond.”
Umerov added: “We’ll be defending and giving punches back… with all the means available.”

Dramatic developments brought on by 1,000-day Ukraine war
A Russian military blogger on Wednesday posted photos on Telegram of a Storm Shadow missile fragment, claiming that up to 12 of the missiles were fired on Russia’s Kursk region.
According to the Russian blog, the fragment was photographed in the Russian village of Marino, which is about 35 miles from the Ukrainian border. The fragment has engravings that say “Storm Shadow.”
The fragments in the photo were confirmed to be from a Storm Shadow missile by weapons expert Trevor Ball, a former senior explosive ordnance technician for the US Army, who reviewed the image for CNN. However, CNN was unable to verify that the Telegram image was taken on Wednesday.
A separate video posted on Telegram, which was verified and geolocated by CNN, shows explosions audible from the Russian village of Marino on Wednesday. A weapons expert who reviewed the video for CNN said there are no indications the explosions are from a different type of munition, but it’s not possible to definitively say they are from Storm Shadow missiles.
The UK and France have previously supplied the longer-range Storm Shadow missiles for Ukraine to use inside its own borders. The missiles have a range of about 250 kilometers (155 miles), which is slightly shorter than the range of the American ATACMS (186 miles).
BBC’s diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams wrote on Wednesday that “Ukraine has so far confined the use of Storm Shadow to the Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops continue to hold ground.” He noted reports were still murky, and the target is not known “but Storm Shadow is powerful enough to penetrate bunkers, with extreme accuracy.”
Ukraine used US missiles to hit ammo depot
The attack comes a day after two US officials told CNN that Ukraine fired US-made ATACMS missiles for the first time across the border to hit a Russian weapons arsenal on Tuesday. The Biden administration on Sunday had given Kyiv the green light to use the longer-range American weapons against targets inside Russia.
Ukraine used eight US missiles to successfully hit an ammunition depot deep inside Russia, according to two US defense officials.

Ukraine fires US-made longer-range missiles into Russia for the first time
The facility struck is in Bryansk, north of the Kursk region, where Ukraine continues to hold Russian territory sezied in a counteroffensive.
According to an initial assessment of the strike, the Ukrainian attack damaged the ammo depot, the officials said. One official added that the US had seen indications of secondary explosions, a common result of striking facilities housing large quantities of ammunition and weapons.
Russia fired two interceptors at the incoming missiles and may have intercepted a pair of the ATACMS, the officials said, but the attack was still successful in hitting its target.
The US assessment contradicts the Russia’s claim that the Ukrainian attack did not cause any casualties or damage.
The Russian Ministry of Defense said on Tuesday that Ukraine had fired six ATACMS missiles at the facility in Bryansk, claiming five of the missiles were shot down and the sixth was damaged. The Ministry said fragments of the missiles fell on the territory of the military facility, causing a fire that was extinguished.
Ukraine has yet to confirm or deny the use of the longer-range US missiles. On Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said: “Ukraine has long-range capabilities. Ukraine has long-range drones of its own production. We now have a long ‘Neptune’ (Ukrainian cruise missiles) and not just one. And now we have ATACMS. And we will use all of this.”

280,Ukraine,2024,11,Analysis: US embassy’s temporary closure in Kyiv reflects a starkly escalating war in Ukraine,Nick Paton Walsh,"Kyiv, Ukraine
CNN
 — 
It is a very specific and high-profile warning, so you would expect the information behind it to have been quite precise.
The US Embassy in Kyiv has not closed since it relocated during the opening months of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But on Wednesday, it announced a one-day closure, citing “specific information of a potential significant air attack.” Kyiv endures air attacks on an almost nightly basis – but the US step suggested a fear of being potentially targeted.
The Greek, Italian, and Spanish embassies followed suit, causing the Ukrainian foreign ministry to plead that its allies behave on the 1001st day of the war, as they had done on the previous thousand days, and not let their anxieties overcome them. Ukrainian defense officials even derided a fake warning circulated widely on Telegram claiming a massive Russian air attack, as being crude Russian-produced misinformation.
A senior advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, told CNN the apparent anxiety after years of war should be put down to Russia’s bid to use “elements of psychological influence.”
“[Moscow] have one instrument, which is to scare. This have always been a classic element of Russian politics. It’s blackmail and panic they want to create. I would like our partners to be more careful as to the information coming from Russia,” he said.
Residents in Kyiv struggled to reconcile the specific nature of the US warnings, with the quotidian daily threat they face. On Wednesday morning alone, there was a 45-minute air raid alert, and then another that lasted two and a half hours.

Biden administration approves sending anti-personnel mines to Ukraine in another major policy shift
In the central Maidan Square, where a sea of flags are each marked with the name of a dead soldier, Anya planted one in memory of her father. She is used to air raids in her hometown of Krivyh Rih, but Wednesday felt different.
“I will be honest, we went down to the basement during every air raid siren today,” she said. “It was really scary indeed.”
Every flag in the square is a story of this war’s trauma and turmoil. Her father died in late October after five months in a coma from frontline injuries, she said. “I want peace very much, but want things to be as they used to be — without Russia. I just want all this to be over.”
Threats and talk of peace are deeply personal across Ukraine, yet the geopolitical risk is growing too. The US Embassy felt compelled to clarify its closure was not linked to the nuanced changes in Russia’s nuclear doctrine, loudly detailed by the Kremlin on Tuesday, insisting it stemmed from the fear of drone or missile attack.
Yet both statements showed how far this war is escalating: a US diplomatic mission saying it feared a direct Russian attack, then specifying at least this would not be nuclear.

It would be a grave and perhaps foolhardy move by the Kremlin to directly attack American government assets in Ukraine now. It would necessitate a severe American response that could trigger a wider war between NATO and Russia. Above all, it would likely tie the hands of US President-elect Donald Trump, who seems keen on stopping “the killing” and striking a deal with Russia. Putin would be wise to hold off a few months.
It is important to remember much of Russia’s domestic narrative insists Moscow is already in a wider war against the US and NATO. That is an inaccurate reflection of the proxy fight, in which NATO is arming Ukraine to wage in its own defense. But it is a story told by the Kremlin to Russians, intended to excuse their appalling performance over a thousand days, fighting a war that was only meant to last a few weeks.
While Russia is the aggressor, strategically it is difficult to see how Moscow can continue to endure the overt Western escalation against its territory without trying to assert some sort of deterrence again. They are slowly finding all the red lines the Kremlin head seems to lay down evaporate in the heat.
Kyiv will likely remain on edge. Moscow might inflict damage on a civilian target where Westerners are known to congregate — a major hotel, or district in the capital. Putin is unlikely to view his slow success on the frontline — and the looming change in the White House — as marking a moment where the tide is turning against him. Rather, he may see the next two months as a test of his patience and resolve, with clear rewards ahead.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/20/europe/ukraine-us-embassys-closure-escalating-war-intl-latam/index.html
281,Ukraine,2024,11,Ukraine’s allies in disarray as Trump-led diplomacy nears,Nick Paton Walsh,"CNN
 — 
A thousand days into Europe’s most grueling war since the Nazis, the starting gun appears to have been fired for peace talks in Ukraine.
Friday’s unilateral move by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to call Russian President Vladimir Putin ended nearly two years of major NATO leaders isolating the Kremlin head.
It was unmitigated bad news for Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, in a 72-hour period marked by the White House finally acceding to his request to be able to fire long-range American ATACMs weapons into Russia. Zelensky fumed that the call had opened “Pandora’s Box.” He said: “It is extremely impo﻿rtant for (Putin) to weaken his isolation.”
Hours later, Zelensky seemed to acknowledge momentum toward talks, saying when US President-elect Donald Trump takes power “war will end sooner,” as this was the promise Trump had made to his voters.
Scholz said his call with Putin revealed the Russian leader’s hardline positions on Ukraine had not changed but added it was important for Europe to talk to Putin, if Trump was about to do the same.
The hour-long conversation marked the return of diplomacy to the decade-long conflict, even if their talk brought the familiar refrain it was not yet time to talk.
The call threw a wild card into a Western alliance experiencing wide-ranging anxiety over the outcome of the conflict in the light of Trump’s election, according to more than 10 interviews CNN carried out with current and former officials and diplomats over the past week.

Trump’s second term could bring chaos around the world. Will it work?
One Western official said there was an “overall collective holding of breath” in Western capitals ahead of Trump’s inauguration.
“The Germans speaking to Putin – that will have gone down badly” among Ukraine’s allies, the official said. “Giving Putin that positive bounce will have irked the French and others.” French President Emmanuel Macron has been particularly vocal about continuing support for Ukraine.
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk posted on X that Sunday night’s substantial Russian missile assault on Ukraine showed that: “No-one will stop Putin with phone calls … telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine. The next weeks will be decisive, not only for the war itself, but also for our future.”
The Biden administration’s decision to permit ATACMs missiles to be fired at Russian territory is perhaps a reflection of the growing sense of escalation in the war, even as possible peace talks loom into view, as all sides seek to improve their position ahead of a Trump presidency.
Analysts said Scholz’s outreach was fueled by imminent German elections.
“Scholz is entering the election campaign as a ‘peacemaker’ to secure votes that might be otherwise drawn to the pro-Moscow bent of some German opposition,” said Alena Epifanova, a research fellow at the German Council on Foreign Relations.
Epifanova said the move might appeal to similar sympathies in Scholz’s own SPD party, but “otherwise it’s very unfortunate for Ukraine.”
A diplomat familiar with the mood inside NATO headquarters described uncertainty in the alliance as to where Trump would fall on continued support and peace negotiations, describing the next few months ahead as critical on the battlefield in Ukraine.
The uncertainty was echoed by a senior Ukrainian intelligence official, who told CNN: “It is very dangerous to make predictions now. We hope for the best!”
Most analysts speculate any deal would involve an approximate freezing of the front lines, with Moscow and Kyiv making or receiving security guarantees to prevent the conflict reigniting. Russia continues to make small yet consistent gains on the eastern front line, and would swallow about a fifth of Ukraine were the front lines negotiated into new permanent borders. Kremlin critics also warn of its history of using diplomacy as a pause or foil to pursuing its military goals.
A French defense official said: “Discussions surrounding the future of Ukraine have gone into overdrive” since Trump’s election, at the heart of which were security guarantees for Ukraine.
“What kind of concessions will Russia agree to?” the official asked. “Does Russia keep all the areas it has seized? And, if we freeze the status quo, will the war really be over? Can there be peace? Or will we see acts of sabotage and subversion?”

Pledges from the Biden administration and Europe have boosted assistance to Kyiv in the past weeks, aimed at indicating Kyiv’s support is assured for months to come.
A second Western official said a recent G7 agreement to loan $50 billion to Ukraine, based on the profits from frozen Russian assets, “means that essentially Ukraine is financially secure all 2025.”

Ukraine is forced to confront a brutal Trump reality that it hoped would never happen
The details of any Trump peace plan remain unclear, some analysts suggest, as the president-elect has yet to formulate a strategy, or decide on personnel who can. He famously said he could bring the war to an end in a day without saying how he would achieve that.
His incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has said almost nothing on policy since accepting the job, but wrote three days before the election in The Economist that fighting “‘as long as it takes’ in a war of attrition against a larger power is a recipe for failure.”
Allies have struggled to read limited signals from the incoming White House. A European diplomat said: “We take (Trump) at his word that he’ll move to a negotiated settlement,” adding the Trump camp had been guarded when discussing their policy, listening but revealing little, and “not saying ‘here’s the plan.’”
Trump supporters have, in part, sought to dispel the idea the president-elect would seek peace at any cost to Kyiv.
Kurt Volker, Trump’s Ukraine envoy in his first term from 2017 to 2019, said Trump’s opening move must be to “demonstrate strength” so Putin realizes it’s not worth continuing to fight, “then you can figure out the details from there. Trump has said many times: ‘peace through strength.’”

Volker said he thought Trump would issue loans rather than more aid to Ukraine.
“I am not convinced he’s going to cut (it) to zero. I believe it’s going to be a lend-lease program,” which Volker said would garner wide Republican support, referencing a World War Two era program under which US-made materiel was effectively loaned to Allies but not returned.
“It doesn’t cost the taxpayer … ‘Borrow as much money as you need, build up your military, be strong, but you should end the war.’”
Volker said he felt Trump would be influenced by the US “catastrophe” in Afghanistan under Biden.
Trump “wanted to get out of Afghanistan himself, but he never did because he was always told this is what would happen,” Volker said.
“He doesn’t want to have that kind of catastrophe on his watch. He’s going to try to find a way to end the war, but Ukraine survives.”
The appointment of Waltz as national security adviser and nomination of Sen. Marco Rubio to secretary of state – both China hawks – may increase focus on the introduction of North Korean troops and weaponry by Moscow to the front line, Western officials suggested.
The move may backfire for Putin, they said, turning the Ukrainian front line into a more global arena, where the United States must now face down Indo-Pacific foes like Kim Jong Un, and his occasional sponsor Beijing.

Massive Russian strikes across Ukraine trigger blackouts and kill at least five people
A former US diplomat familiar with Trump’s approach explained the president-elect’s controversially friendly attitude toward the Kremlin head stemmed from Trump not wanting to “demonize adversaries or people he has to cut deals with.”
They added: “He’ll take policy decisions that are tough, or allow others to do that,” but wants to “have a relationship.”
The former diplomat said Moscow’s deceptive history in negotiations was why Kyiv must be properly armed as part of any settlement. “Putin won’t be sincere – let’s be clear,” the diplomat said.
“He’s going to ask for things that are unreasonable. And then even if he agrees to a ceasefire, he’s going to still then plan on attacking again later.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/18/europe/analysis-ukraine-war-trump-diplomacy-intl-latam/index.html

 — 
Russia launched its largest aerial attack on Ukraine in months, hitting energy infrastructure across the country, killing at least five people and causing widespread damage.
Strikes were reported in several major cities, from Odesa in the south, Dnipro in the east to Rivne in the west. In the capital Kyiv, which has seen near-daily strikes since the start of September, residents were forced to shelter in the metro network.
Two people were killed in a drone strike in the Mykolaiv region, while six others including two children were injured. A further two were killed in Odesa in an attack which also injured a 17-year-old boy, and a woman was killed in her car in Lviv region, the governor said.
The last comparable attack happened on August 28, when Russia launched 127 missiles and 109 attack drones at Ukraine, the Ukrainian Air Force said.
The overnight strikes triggered blackouts in several regions, including Odesa where heating, water and electricity supplies have been cut and hospitals are running on power from generators.

Ukrainian energy company DTEK said its thermal power plants were attacked and equipment was “severely damaged.”
The war - now nearing its third year - has reached a critical point for Ukraine, with Russia making gains across the frontlines and Donald Trump retaking the White House, which could mean the end to vital US support.
Ukraine’s energy supplies have been repeatedly targeted by Russian attacks since its full-scale invasion in February 2022, causing rolling blackouts. Bombardments have intensified in recent months, leaving the country in a precarious position as the war grinds into its third winter.
“This is war criminal Putin’s true response to all those who called and visited him recently. We need peace through strength, not appeasement,” Foreign Minister Andrii Sibyha wrote on X.

Bad news mounts for Ukraine across the frontlines. But Russia is under pressure too
Sibyha was likely referencing Russian leader Vladimir Putin’s recent phone call with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, which lasted an hour and was a rare high-level call between a western leader and Putin, who has been isolated by his invasion of Ukraine.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky said approximately 120 missiles and 90 drones were launched overnight in the Russian attack. Ukraine’s defense forces destroyed over 140 aerial targets, he added.
All parts of Ukaine have been targeted, including the western regions, he said.
“The enemy’s target was our energy infrastructure across Ukraine. Unfortunately, some facilities sustained damage from direct hits and falling debris,” Zelensky said Sunday morning.
The Ukrainian leader added that some areas remain without power, which authorities are working to restore.
In a post on X later on Sunday, Zelensky stressed that “Russian terrorists are once again trying to intimidate us with cold and blackouts, repeating their actions and trying to get results from them.”
The Russian Ministry of Defense acknowledged the attack in a statement on Telegram Sunday, saying that Russia launched a “massive” strike with “high-precision long-range air and sea-based weapons and strike drones” targeting critical energy infrastructure.
Germany’s Scholz on Sunday defended his phone call with the Russian leader. Speaking to reporters, the chancellor described the call as “important” and “very detailed,” although he noted that “little has changed in the Russian President’s views of the war - and that’s not good news.”
He said that it would not be good if a US administration was in regular contact with Putin while no European leader was, referencing Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House.
The attack overnight comes as Russia is making gains at key spots along the frontlines of eastern and southeastern Ukraine, moving closer to key hubs like the city of Kurakhove.
Russia claimed Saturday it captured two more eastern settlements in the Donetsk region, although there was no confirmation from Ukraine. At the same time, Moscow is preparing to launch a counteroffensive in the southern Russian region of Kursk, the site of Kyiv’s only major military success this year.

 — 
The bad news keeps coming. Wherever Kyiv looks, Moscow seems to have the advantage.
Russia is making gains at key spots along the frontlines of eastern and southeastern Ukraine, while unleashing wave after wave of aerial terror against Ukrainian cities.
At the same time, Moscow is preparing to launch a counteroffensive in the southern Russian region of Kursk, the site of Kyiv’s only major military success this year. Moscow has deployed nearly 50,000 troops to Kursk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says, numbers that were boosted by recently arrived North Korean troops.
“The Russians have the initiative across (the frontlines) right now, they have successfully exploited tactical gains and are reinforcing those tactical gains,” George Barros from the Institute for the Study of War told CNN.
Barros, who leads the Russia and Geospatial Intelligence teams at the DC-based conflict monitoring group, said that Russia’s advantage on the battlefield makes it impossible for Ukraine to prepare for a possible counteroffensive.

“The Russians are the ones taking action, and they’re forcing the Ukrainians to respond. That’s not a good thing, because you lose wars by constantly being on the defensive. … You just get boxed into a corner and you have to choose from a buffet of bad options,” Barros added.
The situation is particularly dire around Kupiansk. The key northeastern city is once again at risk of falling to Russia after it was liberated by the Ukrainians in September 2022 following more than six months under Russian occupation.
Kupiansk sits on the crossroads of two major supply roads and the Oskil river, which forms a major defensive feature in the area. Taking over Kupiansk would make it a lot easier for Russia to push further into the Kharkiv region. That would in turn put further pressure on Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second biggest city that has been pummeled by Russian drones and missiles on nearly daily basis.
Russian state news agency Tass reported on Friday that Russian troops entered the outskirts of the city, although Ukrainian officials insisted Kupiansk remained under full control of their forces.
At the same time, Ukraine is struggling to hold back Russian advanced further south, around the city of Kurakhove, which has been surrounded from three sides for months. Earlier this week, Zelensky called the situation around Kurakhove “the most difficult area” of the frontline.
But while Russia seems poised to take over the city in the coming days or weeks, Barros said this may not be a strategically significant loss for Kyiv, as it won’t significantly impact its ability to defend the wider region.
Ukraine has put up a fierce fight in the area in recent months, even though it has lost some ground.
Kurakhove lies some 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of Pokrovsk, a key logistical hub that has been in Russia’s crosshairs for many months. By late summer, Pokrovsk appeared almost certain to fall. Yet Kyiv’s forces have – for now – managed to repel Russia’s advances there, forcing Moscow to redraw its plans.

Barros said that the Pokrovsk situation is just one example of Russia’s failure to achieve its own, publicly stated goals.
“They were working towards trying to seize Pokrovsk this fall, but they have abandoned this operational objective, and they’ve actually started attacking in a different direction,” Barros said.
“It’s not just the Russians failing. It is actually part of a very stalwart Ukrainian defense,” he added.
Since seizing Avdiivka in early 2024, Russia has only managed to advance some 30 to 40 kilometers (18 to 25 miles) deeper into Ukraine’s territory. That is a very small advance given the huge costs to the Russian military.
Moscow has lost about five divisions worth of mechanized equipment, amounting to many hundreds of tanks and armed personnel carriers, in the Pokrovsk region in just the past year, according to the ISW’s assessment of visual evidence from the battlefield.
“To lose five divisions worth of tanks and other personnel carriers over the course of a year to only advance about 40 kilometers, you can go and compare this to all the other major mechanized offenses of the 21st century and even the great battles of the Second World War …. that’s actually a really terrible performance,” Barros said.
War of attrition – but for how much longer?
Since the start of the full-scale invasion, and despite the assistance from its allies, Ukraine has always been on the back foot when it comes to material and manpower.
Russia has more weapons; more ammunition and more people.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s strategy still appears to be slowly grinding Ukraine down by outgunning and outspending it and by wearing down its western allies.
But number of analysts have said that Putin has a limited window of opportunity to achieve this goal, given the staggering losses Russia is suffering to make even the smallest advances.
The strain the conflict is putting on Russia’s economy is clearly growing. Russia has massively increased its military spending over the past two years and its economy is now showing signs of overheating: inflation is running high, and companies are facing labor shortages. Trying to control the situation, the Russian Central Bank has raised interest rates to 21% in October, the highest in decades.
And while Russia has many more people than Ukraine, it is suffering significant losses and recruitment of new troops is already a problem – last time the Russian military introduced a partial mobilization, hundreds of thousands of men fled the country.
The recent influx of North Korean troops into Russia will help for some time, but the material losses could be harder to make up for.
“Between the economy, the shortage of men in Russia and losing the pile of vehicles that the Russians require for their current style warfare, these are strategic resources that are going to impose serious problems on the Kremlin if the current tempo holds for the next year,” Barros said.
Whether Ukraine could take advantage of these problems will depend mostly on the willingness of its allies to continue support it – and the return of the former president Donald Trump to the White House certainly puts a major question mark over that.
Zelensky this week said that the war will end “faster” once Trump returns to the presidency.
“If the international Western coalition, including the United States, keeps backing the Ukrainians for the next maybe 12 to 16, 18 months, there will be opportunities to really disrupt the way that the Russians have been resourcing this war,” Barros said. “(They) can decide whether the Russians win or lose.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/16/europe/ukraine-russia-war-frontlines-latest-intl/index.html

 — 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday said Russia’s war in Ukraine will end “faster” when Donald Trump takes over as US president.
Speaking in a radio interview with Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne, Zelensky admitted to a difficult situation on the battlefield, where Russia has been pressing its advantages in manpower and weaponry.
He said the war “will end faster with the policy of this team that will now lead the White House,” referring to the incoming Trump administration.
“This is their approach, their promise to their society, and it is also very important to them,” he added.
Zelensky stressed that, on Ukraine’s part, “We must do everything to ensure that the war ends next year through diplomatic means.”

Bad news mounts for Ukraine across the frontlines. But Russia is under pressure too
Trump, who was elected for a second term earlier this month, has repeatedly claimed that the Ukraine-Russia war would not have started if he had been president. In July, he said he could settle the war in one day – without saying how he would do so.
Throughout his campaign, the president-elect and his running mate, JD Vance, cast strong doubts on continued US commitment to Kyiv. The war has been ongoing for more than two and a half years, following the large-scale invasion of Russian forces in February 2022.
Meanwhile G7 leaders on Saturday issued a message of unwavering support to Ukraine. “We stand in solidarity contributing to [Ukraine’s] fight for sovereignty, freedom, independence, territorial integrity and its reconstruction,” a statement said.
The group said Russia was “the sole obstacle to just and lasting peace.”
Russia is making gains at key spots along the frontlines of eastern and southeastern Ukraine, moving closer to key hubs like the city of Kurakhove. Russia claimed Saturday it captured two more eastern settlements in the Donetsk region, although there was no confirmation from Ukraine.
At the same time, Moscow is preparing to launch a counteroffensive in the southern Russian region of Kursk, the site of Kyiv’s only major military success this year.
Zelensky admitted the situation in Ukraine’s east was “indeed difficult.”
“There is a slow but steady pressure and advance of the Russians,” he said, adding that they had been waiting for the delivery of some weapons for 12 months.
However, the Ukrainian leader highlighted that Russia’s advances had come at a heavy price for Moscow’s forces, saying they were losing up to 2,000 men per day.
“These are terrible losses,” he said. “They cannot keep advancing with such losses.”
A phone call on Friday between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin drew criticism from Zelensky, who accused Scholz of opening a “Pandora’s box” that only works to undermine efforts to isolate Russia’s leader.
The conversation on Friday was the first time Scholz had spoken with Putin in two years.

285,Isreal,2024,11,International Criminal Court issues arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu,Abbas Al Lawati,"CNN
 — 
The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and a senior Hamas official, accusing them of war crimes during and after the October 7 attacks on Israel last year.
In a statement on Thursday, the Netherlands-based court said it found “reasonable grounds” to believe that Netanyahu bears criminal responsibility for war crimes including “starvation as a method of warfare” and “the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.”

House passes International Criminal Court sanctions bill after prosecutor seeks Netanyahu warrant
The warrants mark a historic first, making Netanyahu the first Israeli leader summoned by an international court for alleged actions against Palestinians in the 76-year conflict. While ICC warrants don’t guarantee arrests, they could significantly restrict Netanyahu’s ability to travel to ICC member states.
The prime minister’s office dismissed the warrants as “absurd and antisemitic.”
“Israel utterly rejects the absurd and false actions and accusations against it by the International Criminal Court, which is a politically biased and discriminatory body,” his office said, adding that there is “no war more just… after the Hamas terrorist organization launched a murderous attack against it, carrying out the largest massacre against the Jewish people since the Holocaust.”
Netanyahu “will not yield to pressure, will not back down, and will not retreat until all the goals of the war set by Israel at the start of the campaign are achieved,” it said.
Israel, like the United States, is not a member of the ICC and has challenged the court’s jurisdiction over its actions in the conflict – a challenge the court rejected on Thursday. The ICC claims jurisdiction over territories Israel occupies, including Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank, following the Palestinian leadership’s formal agreement to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015.
The court on Thursday also issued a warrant for Hamas official Mohammed Diab Ibrahim Al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Deif, who Israel says was one of the masterminds of the October 7 attack. Israel said it killed him in an airstrike in September but Hamas hasn’t confirmed his death.

The ICC said it found “reasonable grounds” to believe that Deif was responsible for “crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, torture, and rape and other form of sexual violence, as well as the war crimes of murder, cruel treatment, torture, taking hostages, outrages upon personal dignity, and rape and other form of sexual violence.”
Deif bears “criminal responsibility” for these crimes, the court said, having “committed the acts jointly and through others… having ordered or induced the commission of the crimes,” and for failing to “exercise proper control over forces under his effective command and control.”

Netanyahu says ICC bid for arrest warrants ‘outrageous.’
The court added that there are “reasonable grounds to believe that the crimes against humanity were part of a widespread and systematic attack directed by Hamas and other armed groups against the civilian population of Israel.”
The ICC prosecutor had initially sought warrants for Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Yahya Sinwar, both of whom have since been killed by Israel. The court said applications for their warrants were withdrawn as a result.
Hamas welcomed the warrants against Israeli officials in a statement, but made no mention of the warrant issued for Deif.
“This… represents a significant historical precedent. It rectifies a longstanding course of historical injustice against our people and the suspicious negligence of the horrific violations they have endured over 76 years of fascist occupation,” it said, calling for all nations to cooperate in bringing the Israeli leaders to justice and “take immediate action to halt the genocide” in Gaza.
Hamas had condemned the ICC prosecutor’s decision to seek warrants against its leaders in May, saying it was an attempt to “equate victims with aggressors.”
US opposes ICC action against Israel
The Biden administration has in the past come out strongly against the involvement of the ICC in investigating Israel’s war in Gaza, but said in the past it did not support sanctions against the international court.
In a statement in May, President Joe Biden said “the ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants against Israeli leaders is outrageous.”
“And let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence — none — between Israel and Hamas,” he said. “We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security.”

In early June, the House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction anyone involved with the ICC efforts “to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute any protected person of the United States and its allies.” It has not been brought to a vote in the Senate.
Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Sunday threatened to pursue sanctions against the ICC if the international court and “and its prosecutor do not reverse their outrageous and unlawful actions to pursue arrest warrants against Israeli officials.”
“If Majority Leader Schumer does not act, the Senate Republican majority will stand with our key ally Israel and make this – and other supportive legislation – a top priority in the next Congress,” he wrote in a post on X.
President-elect Donald Trump imposed sanctions on the former ICC chief prosecutor during his first term in office.
CNN has asked the State Department and NSC for comment on the ICC’s issuance of the arrest warrants Thursday.
Israeli condemnation
Israeli President Isaac Herzog described the warrants as “a dark day for justice. A dark day for humanity.”
He said in a statement on X that “the outrageous decision at the ICC has turned universal justice into a universal laughing stock. It makes a mockery of the sacrifice of all those who fight for justice.”
The decision, he added, “ignores the basic fact that Israel was barbarically attacked and has the duty and right to defend its people. It ignores the fact that Israel is a vibrant democracy, acting under international humanitarian law, and going to great lengths to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population.”
Recently appointed Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said the ICC acted as a political tool serving the most extreme elements working to undermine peace, security, and stability in the Middle East.”

“From an ethical perspective, this is a moral aberration that turns good into evil and serves the forces of evil,” he said. “From a diplomatic perspective, issuing orders against a country acting according to international law is a reward and encouragement for the axis of evil (of Iran-led groups), which flagrantly and consistently violates it.”
Far-right Minister of National Security Itamar Ben Gvir condemned the ICC as “antisemitic from start to finish,” adding that Israel should respond by “applying sovereignty” to the occupied West Bank and building Jewish settlements in all the territories under Israel’s control.
Gallant served as defense minister until this month, when Netanyahu fired him after months of clashes over domestic politics and Israel’s war effort. The prime minister said at the time that “trust between me and the minister of defense has cracked.” Israel Katz, who served as foreign minister until then, became defense minister.
What happens next?
Eliav Lieblich, a professor of international law at Tel Aviv University, described the ICC’s decision as “the most dramatic legal development in Israel’s history.”
“Its immediate meaning is that the 124 state parties to the ICC, which include most of Israel’s closest allies, would be legally obligated to arrest Netanyahu and Gallant should they be present in their territories,” Lieblich told CNN.
There may also be wider implications, he added, which “could limit the ability of third parties to cooperate with” the Israeli military.

After an arrest warrant has been issued, the ICC sends requests for cooperation to member states. The court does not have a police force of its own to make the arrests, but relies on member states to execute them, which state parties are legally obliged to do.
Previous leaders who have been faced with ICC arrest warrants have experienced limitations on their ability to travel, unable to pass through countries legally obliged to arrest them.
ICC judges have issued 56 arrest warrants, resulting in 21 detentions and appearances before the court. Another 27 people remain at large and charges have been dropped against 7 people due to their deaths.

286,Isreal,2024,11,"Israeli airstrikes kill at least 87 in northern and central Gaza as war death toll surpasses 44,000",Abeer Salman,"CNN
 — 
Israeli strikes on northern and central Gaza killed at least 87 Palestinians in 24 hours, local health authorities said, as the death toll in the enclave surpassed 44,000.
At least 65 people were killed in Israeli strikes on northern Gaza overnight, a medical official in the enclave told CNN on Thursday, adding that the toll expected to rise.
Dr. Hossam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, told CNN on Thursday morning that casualties were still being brought to the hospital.
In an interview with Hamas’ Al-Aqsa TV, he said about 200 people were believed to have been at the site when the Israeli military struck.
“The hospital medical team retrieved 65 martyrs from under the rubble,” Abu Safiya said, adding that medical staff were recovering bodies from under the rubble “using their hands” due to the absence of rescue teams.
Safiya warned that the hospital “will turn into a mass grave if urgent intervention from international organizations does not occur and medical supplies are not brought in,” adding that “not a single ambulance” was available in northern Gaza.

In a separate strike on Wednesday, at least 22 people were killed, including 10 children, north of Gaza City in the center of the enclave, according to Dr. Muneer Alboursh, director general of the Ministry of Health in Gaza.
The airstrike hit a family home in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood, Alboursh said in a statement on Thursday.
Gaza’s civil defense said that rescue teams were working to recover people from the rubble and that the death toll was expected to rise.
CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment on both strikes.
The strikes come as the death toll in Gaza climbs after Israel’s renewed offensive in the north of the territory.
At least 44,056 people have been killed and more than 104,000 injured in the enclave since the war began last year, according to the Health Ministry in Gaza.
Meanwhile in Lebanon, Israel launched airstrikes on the southern suburb of Beirut early Thursday, according to Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency (NNA). The strikes were accompanied by low-altitude flights of hostile drones over the area, NNA said.
The airstrikes, targeting the Hezbollah stronghold of Haret Hreik, destroyed several buildings, NNA said.
Earlier on Thursday, Avichay Adraee, the Israel military’s spokesperson to Arabic media, posted evacuation warnings on X mapping three buildings in the area Haret Hreik, saying they were potential targets. He issued a similar evacuation warning for seven buildings in the historic southern city of Tyre.
Israel’s strikes came as US envoy Amos Hochstein engages in ceasefire negotiations between Lebanon and Israel. He arrived in Israel on Wednesday.
While in Lebanon on Tuesday, Hochstein said that a ceasefire deal is “within our grasp,” but added it was ultimately “the decision of the parties.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday offered $5 million and safe passage out of Gaza to anyone returning a hostage.
“To those who want to leave this entanglement I say: Whoever brings us a hostage will find a safe way out for himself and his family. We will also give $5 million for every hostage,” Netanyahu said.
“Choose, the choice is yours, but the result will be the same. We will bring them all back.”
Speaking at the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza alongside Defense Minister Israel Katz, Netanyahu added that whoever harmed a hostage would “pay the price.”

Families of American hostages captured by Hamas turn to Donald Trump for new hope
Critics of the prime minister have accused him of deliberately stalling negotiations for a hostage release deal, alleging it serves to extend the war and prolong his hold on power – claims Netanyahu has denied.
His announcement was met with outrage from the mother of Matan Zangauker, one of the hostages still held in Gaza.
“The prime minister is trading the hostages’ lives,” said Einav Zangauker.
She criticized Netanyahu for “offering money to Hamas” and said his attempt to “divide and rule in Gaza through bribes to the captors” would put the hostages at risk.
“It’s unbelievable that the man who funded Hamas is once again offering money to Hamas,” she said, referring to a controversial deal in which Qatar sent millions of dollars to Gaza for years with Israel’s backing.
Netanyahu defended the initiative when it was launched in 2018, saying it was meant to return calm to Israeli villages in the south and prevent a humanitarian disaster in Gaza.
“When this is the strategy of the prime minister, I understand that he has no intention to save the hostages, he’ll continue stalling, and he intends to sacrifice them and the soldiers on the altar of his political considerations,” Zangauker said.
When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7 of last year, it killed more than 1,200 people and took over 250 others hostage. Of those abducted, 97 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of at least 34 confirmed dead by the Israeli military.

288,Isreal,2024,11,Israel says it has expanded its military ground operation in Lebanon,Mohammed Tawfeeq,"CNN
 — 
Israel’s military ground operation in southern Lebanon has been expanded, the country’s defense minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday.
Katz did not clarify when the decision to expand operations was taken and did not offer any details on what the expansion entails. Israel launched what it described as a “limited ground operation” to expel Hezbollah from southern Lebanon early last month.
“We have expanded the ground maneuver in southern Lebanon and we are operating against Hezbollah targets in the Dahiyeh district in Beirut and wherever necessary,” Katz told soldiers during his first visit to Israel’s Northern Command.
There were nearly 20 Israeli airstrikes against what the Israeli military described as Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Beirut on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The newly appointed defense minister maintained that Israel will not agree to “any ceasefires.”
“We will not take our foot off the pedal,” Katz said, adding that Israel will not “agree to any deal that does not ensure the disarmament of Hezbollah and its withdrawal across the Litani River – and especially Israel’s right to enforce … and act against any terrorist activity and organization.”
The Litani river is some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Israel’s northern border.
Israel’s strikes across Lebanon killed at least 43 people on Thursday, including eight civil defense workers, according to Lebanon’s health ministry and civil defense directorate.
The General Directorate of the Civil Defense said on X that an Israeli strike destroyed their headquarters in the village of Douris near Baalbek.
The civil defense building was hit “while a number of workers were inside, ready to receive calls for relief and immediate intervention to assist citizens,” the directorate said in a statement.
Three other people were killed in the same strike, the health ministry said.
CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment on the alleged strikes on civil defense workers.
The IDF told CNN earlier on Thursday that it “has been operating to defend Israel’s northern border, striking military targets in order to counter the continuing threat Hezbollah poses to Israeli homes and families.”
The IDF also accused Hezbollah of escalating its attacks against Israel and said the militant group has fired over 16,000 rockets into Israel since October 8, 2023.
Earlier on Thursday, an Israeli strike hit al-Shaab neighborhood in Baalbek, killing eight people and injuring 27 others, according to Lebanon’s health ministry. Four other people were killed and 14 others were injured in two separate airstrikes in the Baalbek-Hermel region, the ministry added.
Separately, an Israeli strike targeted a mobile center of the Hezbollah-affiliated Islamic Health Authority in the southern Lebanese village of Arabsalim, killing six people, including four health workers, the health ministry said on Thursday.
Despite the Israeli ground operation into southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has maintained a daily barrage of rockets against parts of northern Israel and continues to launch drones against Israeli cities. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said around 50 projectiles were fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon into Israel on Wednesday.
Hezbollah on Wednesday said it had carried out at least 20 attacks against Israel and its troops in Lebanon with drones, missiles, and rockets, saying its actions were “in support of our steadfast Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip … and in defense of Lebanon and its people.”
Hezbollah’s Secretary-General Naim Qassem on Wednesday praised the militant group’s fighters for their support in a handwritten letter published online. The letter comes after the group’s members expressed support over the weekend for his leadership. Qassem was named the group’s new leader in late October, a month after his predecessor Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli strike.
Growing toll on civilians
Israel’s offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon continues to exact a heavy toll on civilians. Airstrikes on several towns across Lebanon have killed at least 20 children since Sunday, according to the Lebanese health ministry.
In the town of Joun in southern Lebanon, at least eight children were killed on Tuesday, the ministry said. A separate attack on Tuesday killed at two children in Baalchmay, southeast of Beirut.
On Wednesday, an Israeli attack in the village of Dawhet Aramoun, south of Beirut, left three children dead. On Sunday, an Israeli strike in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut, left seven children dead.
The Israeli military told CNN on Thursday that it has been “operating to defend Israel’s northern border, striking military targets in order to counter the continuing threat Hezbollah poses to Israeli homes and families,” since cross-border hostilities escalated on October 8, 2023.
“Hezbollah has continued to escalate its attacks against Israel, firing over 16,000 rockets from Lebanon into northern Israel, killing civilians and displacing tens of thousands from their homes,” the IDF said, adding that it makes “great efforts to estimate and consider potential civilian collateral damage.”
The number of children killed in Lebanon over the past 50 days now accounts for 80% of all children killed in the past year, UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said Wednesday in a post on X.
“Children in Lebanon are enduring the deadliest phase of this war,” he added.

As of Tuesday, at least 2,683 people had been killed and 12,144 injured in Lebanon since mid-September when Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah, according to a CNN tally of health ministry figures. The health ministry numbers do not distinguish between combatants and civilians.
Katz’s announcement about expanding Israel’s ground operation also comes as the military confirmed the death of six Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon on Wednesday. This marks one of the deadliest days for Israeli troops in Lebanon since the start of the ground incursion on October 1. The deadliest day so far was on October 2, when eight soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon.
Those killed on Wednesday were all from the Golani brigade – regarded as an elite infantry unit – and included a platoon commander, a squad commander, a squad sergeant, and three soldiers, the IDF said.
At least 41 Israeli soldiers have been killed in Lebanon since the start of Israel’s ground incursion on October 1, according to a CNN tally of the IDF figures. At least 792 Israeli soldiers have been killed, including 373 killed inside the Gaza Strip, since Hamas’s deadly attacks on the country on October 7, 2023, according to the IDF.

289,Isreal,2024,11,Human Rights Watch accuses Israel of mass displacement in Gaza amounting to a war crime,Mick Krever,"CNN
 — 
Israel has overseen the forced mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza in a deliberate and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity, according to a new Human Rights Watch report.
The 154-page report, published by the US-based advocacy group on Thursday, details more than 13 months of widespread destruction in Gaza that, according to the United Nations, has seen the displacement of about 1.9 million Palestinians – more than 90% of the territory’s population.
In a statement, Human Rights Watch (HRW) cited the illegal and “deliberate, controlled demolitions of homes and civilian infrastructure,” by Israeli forces in Gaza “where they have apparent aims of creating ‘buffer zones’ and security ‘corridors,’ from which Palestinians are likely to be permanently displaced.”
“The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation,” said Nadia Hardman, a HRW refugee and migrant rights researcher.
“Israel has blatantly violated its obligation to ensure Palestinians can return home, razing virtually everything in large areas.”
In a response to the report on Thursday, the Israeli military said it is “committed to international law and operates accordingly,” and that it issues evacuation orders to protect civilians from combat.
The Israeli military also denied there was any “doctrine that aims causing maximal damage to civilian infrastructure regardless of military necessity,” and said any “reports and complaints regarding the violation of international law” are referred to an internal review body.
Israel has been accused by multiple human rights groups – and UN investigators – of military conduct that could amount to war crimes over the past year, which it has vociferously denied. Hamas has also been accused of war crimes.
In October, a UN inquiry said Israel had a “concerted policy” of destroying the health care system in Gaza in what it said amounted to war crimes.
The Israeli foreign ministry called those accusations “outrageous” and said they were “another blatant attempt by the (commission) to delegitimize the very existence of the State of Israel and obstruct its right to protect its population while covering up the crimes of terrorist organizations.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said that “Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.”
On Sunday, Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar said Palestinians would be able to return to their homes in northern Gaza when the war ends – but not before Israel’s objectives were achieved.
Several Israeli ministers, however, have said they would like to see Palestinians leave Gaza and reestablish Israeli settlements there.
“We must promote a solution to encourage the emigration of the residents of Gaza,” far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said on January 1.
And far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who also holds a position in the Defense Ministry, has said Israel “will rule (in Gaza). And in order to rule there securely for a long time, we must have a civilian presence.”

The HRW report comes after the US State Department said Tuesday that Israel had not violated United States law following the passing of a 30-day deadline for it to take specific steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza – a stance in sharp contrast to the findings of aid organizations about the dire reality in the enclave.
Aid agencies have described the situation in northern Gaza as apocalyptic, with areas at imminent risk of famine as Israel wages an ongoing military offensive there.
Human Rights Watch said the Israeli campaign in northern Gaza would likely lead to the displacement of hundreds of thousands more civilians.
The group urged countries to halt arms sales to Israel and impose sanctions on the Jewish state to push it to comply with its international obligations to protect civilians. It also called on the International Criminal Court to investigate the alleged forced displacement of Palestinians as a crime against humanity.

 — 
The FBI announced on Thursday the arrest of a Texas man who allegedly created and disseminated ISIS propaganda and wanted to commit a “9/11-style” attack in the United States.
The man, Anas Said, was arrested last week outside of his apartment in Houston, Texas. His arraignment and detention hearing are set before a federal judge Thursday afternoon on the charge of attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization.
Said told agents following his arrest that “he tried several times to travel to join ISIS and stated he would readily move back to Lebanon if he were released,” according to a detention memo filed in court by prosecutors. According to Houston’s FBI field office, he admitted to offering his home as a “safe sanctuary” to ISIS operators.
“He also discussed his efforts to commit violence in the United States, including considering purchasing a gun, researching military recruitment facilities, and scouting one specific location” in Houston, according to the memo.
Said told investigators he “considered asking military members that he would see near his work if they supported Israel or if they had been deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq and killed Muslims there, and if they said yes, those are the persons he would kill,” the memo said.
CNN has reached out to Said’s attorney for comment.
According to court documents, the FBI has been aware of Said’s support of ISIS since 2017, when he ordered stickers related to ISIS. At the time, Said told agents that he started believing in ISIS’s ideology in 2015, following his returning to the US from Lebanon. Prosecutors say Said was born in Houston in 1996 but traveled “shortly thereafter” to Lebanon where he and his family lived until 2014.
In follow-up interviews, Said told the FBI he no longer consumed ISIS media and propaganda. But in late 2023 and into 2024, the FBI discovered that Said was using several Facebook accounts “to support ISIS and the violent attacks carried out in its name,” according to court documents.
Following his arrest, Said allegedly told investigators he researched locations, layouts and security measures at synagogues and the Israel Consulate in Houston and said that he intended to confront the head of an unnamed Jewish organization to stop funding Israel.
“If the head of the organization refused, then the Defendant would assault him/her,” prosecutors wrote in court documents.
In interviews with Said’s brother and mother, the two told investigators how he continued to consume ISIS propaganda and, according to his brother, “openly acknowledged that he wants to fight against and kill proponents of Israel.”
According to prosecutors, Said shared and created a significant amount of ISIS propaganda online and established an encrypted chat group for ISIS followers.
In one message that Said allegedly sent to an undercover FBI employee, Said wrote, “Brother, if I was living alone, you would have heard that I conducted an operation like 9/11. But my family is with me and I don’t want to put them in trouble.”",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/politics/houston-isis-arrest/index.html

 — 
Nearly 90 congressional Democrats are calling on President Joe Biden to impose sanctions on two far-right Israeli government officials for their roles in inciting settler violence in the West Bank.
“Violent settlers, fueled by the inflammatory rhetoric and incitement to violence by members of the Israeli cabinet, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, and empowered by extremist organizations like Regavim and Amana, have carried out over 1,270 recorded attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, averaging more than three violent attacks per day,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter to the US President.
“Given their critical roles in driving policies that promote settler violence, weaken the Palestinian Authority, facilitate de facto and de jure annexation, and destabilize the West Bank, we urge you to sanction Finance Minister (Bezalel) Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir,” they wrote.
The letter was signed by a significant number of Democrats – 17 senators and 71 members of the House of Representatives – and was sent at the end of October, before the US election which Donald Trump won. It was made public on Thursday in order to pressure Biden to take action during his final months in office as frustration grows from within Biden’s own party about his administration’s seeming unwillingness to hold the Israeli government to account.
“We’ve not yet gotten a response from the White House, and we think the clock is ticking in the aftermath of the election,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, one of the lead lawmakers who signed the letter. “We do think that there’s a pretty short window, obviously, for the Biden administration to take this action.”
“We see President-elect Trump’s nominations, and we think it’s more important than ever that President Biden right now state that the United States is not going to be a rubber stamp to the Netanyahu government’s extreme actions on the West Bank,” he said.
CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
In February, Biden issued an executive order allowing sanctions on those undermining “peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.” The lawmakers urged the president to sanction Smotrich and Ben Gvir using this authority.
Although officials within the Biden administration have denounced Smotrich and Ben Gvir for their extremist rhetoric and actions in the West Bank, they have yet to impose sanctions on them. Just this week, Smotrich, on the heels of Trump’s reelection, ordered preparations for the annexation of settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. In June, he announced plans to legally recognize five unauthorized Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Ben Gvir has previously been convicted for supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism.
The lawmakers also urged Biden to sanction two organizations – Amana, which they said “has long played a key role in establishing the majority of West Bank settlements and provides loans and building infrastructure for new outposts that are illegal under Israeli law” and Regavim, “which was co-founded by Smotrich” and whose “mission is to obstruct Palestinian construction in the West Bank.”
“With radical officials in the Netanyahu government continuing to enable settler violence and enact annexationist policies, it is clear that further sanctions are urgently needed,” the lawmakers wrote. “The key individuals and entities that are destabilizing the West Bank – thereby also threatening the security of Israel and the broader region, and US
national security as well – should be directly held accountable.”
“The message that such actions are unacceptable from leaders, including within the Israeli government, must be heard,” they wrote in the letter, which was also led by Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Rep. Sean Casten.
Last week, United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country is considering sanctions on the two far-right ministers.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/politics/democrats-israel-biden-sanctions/index.html
